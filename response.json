            "content": "Article content Soccer Quebec announced the departure of its general manager, Pari Arshagouni, Thursday morning. Arshagouni was appointed in October. The head of the Association Régionale de Soccer de Québec, Philippe Bernard, will take over the interim role as of Monday for a period of 30 to 90 days, the organization said. Among other things, he will ensure the establishment of a recovery plan and, if necessary, be supported in this process by other regional associations. Teams from the Sport, Leisure and Outdoor sector of the Ministry of Education also offered all the necessary support to the federation in this transition, it said. “Soccer Québec and Mr. Arshagouni have agreed to end our collaboration. We would like to thank Mr. Arshagouni for his dedication to the organization, whether as administrator or general manager,” the statement reads.",

            "description": "Pittsburgh is the NHL's oldest team. They are out of a playoff spot and, unlike the Canadiens, have few draft picks to help them rebuild.",
            "content": "Article content Montreal and Pittsburgh are both in rebuild mode, but the Canadiens are in a much better space. They are the second-youngest team in the NHL and the team’s brain trust of Jeff Gorton and Kent Hughes have a solid plan in place. They have a young core up front with Nick Suzuki, Cole Caufield, Juraj Slafkovsky and Kirby Dach. Mike Matheson adds skill and stability to a group of young defencemen. The Penguins defeated the Canadiens 4-1 in a must-win game Thursday in Pittsburgh but they still face an uphill battle as they attempt to avoid missing the playoffs for a second consecutive season. The victory left them with 58 points, seven points behind Tampa Bay for the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. They also have to move past the Devils, the Islanders and the Capitals, who are deadlocked at 60 points. There are prospects like Lane Hutson and first-round draft pick David Reinbacher and more to come. The Canadiens have a stockpile of 29 draft picks over the next three years, including two first-round picks in each of the next two years and a total of 11 picks in the first three rounds over that span. By comparison, the Pittsburgh cupboard is bare. The Penguins are the oldest team in the NHL and they can’t look forward to rebuilding through the draft. Kyle Dubas, who hired himself as general manager after leaving the Toronto Maple Leafs in a salary cap mess, has no first-round pick in June. He has only five picks and two of them are in the seventh round. He has a first-round pick in 2025, but no pick in the second or third round. The Penguins are in this situation because they were hoping to keep the aging core of Sidney Crosby (36), Evgeni Malkin (37) and Kris Letang (36) together for yet another Stanley Cup run and they traded away their first-round pick to San Jose as part of a convoluted three-team trade that brought 33-year-old defenceman Erik Karlsson to Pittsburgh . Karlsson was coming off a 101-point season that earned him his third Norris Trophy as the NHL’s top defenceman. It should be noted that Karlsson is the worst defenceman to win the Norris Trophy three times. For all of his offensive heroics, he was minus-26 last season and has been a double-digit minus for most of his career. He is on the plus side of the ledger this season, but hasn’t helped boost a dismal offence. With three can’t miss Hall of Famers on the roster, the Penguins rank 25th in offence and 30th on the power play. The Penguins missed the playoffs last season after a 16-year run that produced Stanley Cups in 2009, 2016 and 2017. That success meant Pittsburgh didn’t get any high draft choices and their only top-end prospect is centre Brayden Yager, who’s looking at another year of junior hockey in Moose Jaw. Dubas, the longtime boy genius and poster boy for advanced analytics, does have a way to regain a first-round draft pick this year, but it would require trading potential UFA Jake Guentzel, who is the team’s second-leading scorer and Crosby’s linemate. He is currently sidelined with an upper-body injury, but he’s certainly gone if the Penguins don’t move up in the standings. Toronto comes to life: I’ve been watching games in Toronto for more than half a century but last week’s Professional Women’s Hockey League tilt between Montreal and Toronto featured the loudest and most enthusiastic crowd I’ve witnessed in Hogtown since Game 2 of the 1972 Canada-Soviet Union series. The game at Scotiabank Arena attracted a sellout crowd of 19,285, and that number didn’t include a few babies in arms and two support dogs. It was a record crowd for a professional women’s game, eclipsing the mark of 13,316 fans at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul for the Montreal-Minnesota game on Jan. 6 . It also broke the all-time record for a women’s game, topping the 18,013 fans who saw Canada beat Finland in a preliminary-round game at the 2013 world championships in Ottawa. While Montreal coach Kori Cheverie was disappointed after losing 3-0, she viewed the crowd as a challenge and hoped her team could break the record at the Bell Centre. It won’t happen this season, but it’s a goal for the future. Montreal did set a franchise record Sunday with a sellout crowd of 10,172 at Place Bell for a 2-1 win over first-place Minnesota . Ottawa made it a weekend sellout sweep for the Canadian teams with 8,451 fans for Saturday’s game against Minnesota at TD Place. The Ottawa women are averaging nearly twice as many fans as the building’s main tenant, the OHL Ottawa 67s. Montreal has a more modest sellout coming up Saturday. A standing-room only crowd of more than 4,000 will watch Montreal play Ottawa at Verdun Auditorium (2:30 p.m., SN1, Ici Radio-Canada Télé) . phickey0412@gmail.com twitter.com/zababes1",

            "description": "Bérubé sent the email from his National Assembly address, which was an “anecdotal, superficial and minor\" violation.",
            "content": "Article content QUEBEC — The Parti Québécois MNA for Matane-Matapédia, Pascal Bérubé, did not commit any ethical misconduct when he accidentally sent a campaign email using his National Assembly email account, the Ethics Commissioner said in a report tabled Thursday. On Oct. 6, Ariane Mignolet agreed to follow up on a request for an investigation made by the president of the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) caucus, Mario Laframboise. The latter claimed to have reasonable grounds to believe that Bérubé had committed a breach of Article 36 of the Code of Ethics, which relates to the use of state goods and services. In the middle of a by-election in Quebec City’s Jean-Talon riding, Bérubé sent a partisan message to citizens from his National Assembly email address. He also acknowledged the facts at a press briefing on Sept. 19, insisting that the error had been quickly corrected. The message sent by Bérubé invited citizens to lend a hand to the PQ to elect its candidate in Jean-Talon, Pascal Paradis. Laframboise was indignant that “not only is the MNA sending an email to a large number of people to solicit their partisan involvement in a by-election, he is also asking them to send him names and contact details on his National Assembly email address.” Commissioner Mignolet concluded that Bérubé did not commit a breach: the use of state goods and services by the MNA was “anecdotal, superficial and minor,” she ruled. “Although the evidence collected demonstrates that the email was sent from a state resource … the use is not significant enough to constitute a breach of the code,” she said. “The MNA sent his email only to members and supporters of the PQ among whom he wanted to generate action favourable to his political party, and not to all voters in the constituency.” Mignolet also stressed that, in this particular case, she would have preferred to have the opportunity to do a “preliminary examination,” rather than follow a “formal investigative process.” However, the code does not allow this. “A preliminary examination would make it possible … to obtain more information on the context of a situation in order to validate the opportunity to investigate,” she explained, noting that a recommendation relating to the the establishment of such a mechanism was welcomed by the Institutions Committee in November 2023. In the press scrum, Bérubé said he was satisfied with the commissioner’s conclusions. He accused the CAQ of having filed a complaint for political reasons. “It was an attempt by the CAQ to annoy me, which fell through,” he said. “I didn’t enjoy the experience. It was a bad time to go through.” He noted that Deputy Premier Geneviève Guilbault recently used the commissioner’s investigation to link him to “questionable events.” Guilbault has since apologized. “It was exploited. There is a minister who decided to use that against me. … I know very well why they did it: It was to annoy me. … I know that’s what they did it for.” Bérubé counterattacked Thursday by claiming to have seen during the by-election “a large number of ministers and political staff walking the streets of Jean-Talon with their cellphones, sending emails to each other, participating fully.” “When I spoke with the ethics commissioner, I suggested that she look at that too,” he said.",

            "content": "Article content New research indicates that even if a majority of current smokers and people who recently stopped smoking are aware of resources to help them quit their habit, very few use them. The study published by the Institut national de santé publique (INSPQ) notes that even the most publicized and best-known services are largely ignored by those they were created to help. The online telephone service and website I QUIT NOW are known to 81 per cent of current smokers and 61 per cent of those who recently quit smoking, but were only used by two per cent and eight per cent respectively, with mixed reviews about its usefulness. Pharmacological aids such as nicotine patches, gums and tablets are known to 95 per cent of current and recently quit adult smokers, however only 10 per cent of that group used them. The INSPQ points out that while the aids available to smokers have proved their worth and their costs are far less than those engendered by tobacco-related illnesses, most smokers and recently quit smokers say they want to end their tobacco use on their own. Authors of the study note that the decision to largely ignore resources to help stop smoking is not unique to Quebec and can be observed elsewhere in Canada and the world. The INSPQ study’s results are based on a survey of 1,336 current and recently quit smokers conducted from February to May of 2022.",

            "description": "Colin White played his first game for the Canadiens in a 4-1 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Thursday at PPG Paints Arena.",
            "content": "Article content The Pittsburgh Penguins scored two goals in a span of 21 seconds on the way to a 4-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday night at PPG Paints Arena. Once again, the second period did the Habs in. They’re now minus-27 on the season in the middle frame after giving up two goals last night to the Pens. A new Hab suited up in bleu-blanc-rouge. Colin White was picked up via waivers from the Pittsburgh Penguins, so he made his way to the visitors locker room to join his new club. He wore number 36. Brandon Gignac was placed on waivers in a corresponding move. Jayden Struble also left the game after taking an awkward stretch with no one around him. He left the ice barely putting any weight on his leg. Habs jumped out to an early start, firing five shots on Tristan Jarry before Cayden Primeau saw any rubber. Mike Matheson opened scoring after Kris Letang handed him the puck attempting to exit the zone. Letang would make up for his faux pas just under two-and-a-half minutes later, beating Primeau on a shot through traffic. It was tied up 1-1 after the first period. It was a bit of a quid pro quo, since Matheson’s giveaway led to the goal. The Habs were only outshot 10-8 in the second period, but they couldn’t reverse their worrisome trend of swooning at the midpoint. Just six seconds after Brendan Gallagher entered the penalty box, Bryan Rust scored off a deflection in front to give Pittsburgh a 2-1 lead. Back at even strength, 21 seconds later Erik Karlsson cut inside and set up Drew O’Connor for his second goal in as many games to push Pittsburgh’s lead to 3-1. The Habs entered the game having lost their last two games by only a goal, but there was inching closer in the third period last night. Letang ended it with an empty netter, and even though Montreal managed to outshoot the Pens 9-5 in the third, they couldn’t mount a comeback. The Penguins are fighting for their playoff lives, while the Habs are now one point out of the Atlantic Division cellar. Joshua Roy had the best chance to cut the lead. He took a hit along the end boards before bouncing back up and getting two shots at Jarry. More worrisome is the state of Jayden Struble after he left the game under unusual circumstances. No one touched him when he stretched out his leg entering the zone, but it was seemingly enough to do some serious damage, as he struggled to get off the ice. After a hot start for the newly established top line of Cole Caufield-Nick Suzuki-Juraj Slafkovsky, the sizzle has worn off this week. Last night was likely their worst as a trio so far. The tank is on in the liveblog comments , but there’s a catch this time around. The last two years, it was generally understood that the Habs would struggle, and it’s all part of the process of digging out of rock bottom. This year, some expected the team to be a bit more competitive. The young defence is a year older, but the growing pains are still evident. The penalty kill remains a sore spot. The Habs finished in 28th last season. This year they’re 26th, with the Senators coming up from behind. When the season is over, will general manager Kent Hughes be satisfied with the incremental progress made by his young club, or will he be looking to make more radical changes?",

            "content": "Article content If you have a question you’d like to ask for the weekly Habs Mailbag, you can email it to montrealcanadiens@postmedia.com I have been to a few Canadiens games when they retired jersey numbers and it’s quite something to see. I don’t understand why No. 22 — for both John Ferguson and Steve Shutt — has not been retired and I don’t understand why Cole Caufield is playing now with No. 22. The same thing with No. 25 for Jacques Lemaire. Can we start a petition for this? Bernie Mlynarski If Shutt and Lemaire played for teams other than the Canadiens (who have very high standards) I’m pretty sure their numbers would be hanging from the rafters of the home arenas where they played. Not so sure about John Ferguson. To me, the first requirement for having a player’s number retired is that he’s a Hall of Famer — something Shutt and Lemaire are, but Ferguson isn’t. I would put Shutt ahead of Lemaire in line for number retirement since he shares the team record for most goals in a season (60) with Guy Lafleur and is tied for fifth all-time in goals for the Canadiens, trailing only Maurice Richard, Lafleur, Jean Béliveau and Yvan Cournoyer. But at the top of my list would be No. 6 for Toe Blake. He’s in the Hall of Fame as a player after winning two Stanley Cups with the Canadiens and one with the Montreal Maroons and then he won eight more Cups as head coach of the Canadiens. Blake was part of the famous Punch Line with Richard (No. 9) and Elmer Lach (No. 16) who have both had their numbers retired by the Canadiens. Blake should join them. What will the top six forwards look like next year for the Canadiens when Kirby Dach is back from his knee injury? Juraj Slafkovsky and Dach had good chemistry when they played together and Dach played great with Nick Suzuki and Cole Caufield as well. Marc St. Pierre I would expect the No. 1 line to start next season will still be Suzuki between Caufield and Slafkovsky. However, that could change depending on what player or players GM Kent Hughes might acquire before next season and what happens at the draft. If Hughes can acquire a player like Trevor Zegras, that would change things. But picking from the players the Canadiens have now, I can see Dach playing between Alex Newhook and Joshua Roy on the second line to start next season. If you had to name seven defencemen who would be playing for the Habs in two or three years, who would they be? Peter Arvanitakis Mike Matheson still has two more seasons left on his contract, so let’s go with two years instead of three. I can see the seven defencemen in two years being Matheson, Kaiden Guhle, Jayden Struble, Arber Xhekaj, Logan Mailloux, David Reinbacher and Lane Hutson, presuming the latter three develop like team management hopes they will. Have we given up on Brendan Gallagher, or does the team expect him to bounce back and earn his US$8 million this season and US$9 million next season? This contract must be addressed more seriously even though it’s not Kent Hughes who extended it. Michael Langille I don’t think the Canadiens have given up on Gallagher, but they do realize he has become a very expensive third- or fourth-line player. As head coach Martin St. Louis has said many times, Gallagher continues to be someone who can bring other players into the fight. His work ethic and compete level are always there and he remains a well-respected leader on this team. But the wear and tear on his body with the style of game he plays has really started to show at age 31. If the Canadiens were to buy Gallagher out at this point it would still have a big impact on the team salary cap moving forward. According to CapFriendly.com, the Canadiens would save US$6.5 million in cash by buying Gallagher out. They would get a small salary-cap break next season with a buyout, but the salary-cap hit would be $2.166 million in 2025-26, $4.666 million in 2026-27 and then $2.166 million again for 2027-28, 2028-29 and 2029-30. At this point, with three seasons remaining on his contract with a $6.5-million cap hit, it seems like the Canadiens are better off to keep Gallagher. scowan@postmedia.com twitter.com/StuCowan1",

            "content": "Article content The English Montreal School Board has erred on the side of caution and “in light of” a solar eclipse happening April 8 will close most schools and daycares. FACE is the only elementary and high school that will have a regular school day. The building is eclipsed by downtown Montreal skyscrapers and a mountain, so that might help. The Sir Wilfried Laurier School Board has also cancelled classes for April 8. The decision to create or move a pedagogical day is made at the school board and individual school level. Other English school boards in Quebec have yet to release their decisions. The event begins at 2:15 p.m. and ends at 4:36 p.m., when children are most likely to be outside waiting for parents or school buses. The “moment of totality” is 3:27 p.m., the Montreal Science Centre says. As the moon passes in front of the sun, the sky will go dark and “the magnificent solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye,” according to the science centre. The totality will last around three minutes. The EMSB posted the decision on its Facebook page and was flooded with more than 80 comments, which appeared to fall into four categories: What’s the big deal, anyway? “On a regular day, your eyes will automatically resist when you try to stare directly at the sun,” the Montreal Science Centre says. “When there is an eclipse, most of these rays are hidden, which makes it seem safe to look at them directly, but it’s not. The sun’s rays are powerful, and even just a few can burn your retinas.” The only safe ways to watch an eclipse are with specially designed glasses, by watching indirectly or using a handmade projector. The science centre includes tips on its website, montrealsciencecentre.com . EMSB adult education and vocational centres will be open. This is the first total solar eclipse visible in Montreal since 1938 and it will be 180 years till there’s another.",

            "description": "Pittsburgh 4, Montreal 1. The Canadiens now have a 1-10 record in the second half of back-to-back games.",
            "content": "Article content Can you smell the Stanley Cup after the Canadiens claimed centre Colin White off waivers from Pittsburgh on Thursday? No, neither can we. White, who participated in the Penguins’ optional morning skate before the deal was announced, had no points in 11 games, while averaging 9:57 of ice time, since being recalled from AHL Wilkes-Barre/Scranton last month, where he had five goals and 10 points in 21 games. In White, 27, Montreal has acquired another forward who can’t score. With any luck, he’ll at least prove to be defensively responsible. A former first-round draft choice by Ottawa in 2015, White had eight goals and 15 points with Florida last season. In 304 career games over eight seasons, he has 44 goals and 113 points. Coincidentally, Canadiens general manager Kent Hughes was his former agent. With the addition of White, the Canadiens placed Brandon Gignac on waivers for the purpose of a loan to the AHL Laval Rocket. Gignac is the Rocket’s best player. This move indicates management is serious about the Rocket qualifying for the playoffs — especially since the Canadiens won’t. News you need (Part I): The Canadiens now have a 1-10 record in the second half of back-to-back games. This is a young team that shouldn’t be affected by contests on consecutive nights. Montreal also is on a four-game losing streak heading into Saturday afternoon’s game at New Jersey. But don’t lose hope. Arizona comes to the Bell Centre next Tuesday. News you need (Part II): The Canadiens also lost four straight between Nov. 12 and Nov. 18. Montreal also has lost six of its last seven and is 3-9-1 over a 13-game span. The Canadiens have allowed at least three goals in 11 of those 13 games. Can anyone stop the bleeding? Is there a doctor in the house? This is for all the old guys: The Penguins, with an average age of 30.4, are the NHL’s oldest team. The franchise now is a distant memory of the juggernaut that captured consecutive Stanley Cups in 2016 and ’17. On the other hand Sidney Crosby, at age 36, remains productive. He has a team-leading 31 goals and 56 points in 54 games. That’s more goals and points than any Montreal player. The Canadiens’ average age, in case you were wondering, is 26.3. Strange, but true (Part I): The Penguins now have a goal differential of plus-14. They’re the only NHL team with a plus goal differential below the playoff line. Strange, but true (Part II): No penalties were assessed in the first period. Strange, but true (Part III): Mike Matheson opened the scoring at 9:05. It was the 38th goal scored by a Canadiens defenceman, second behind Colorado. The last three Montreal goals have all been scored by defencemen. And this is why teams miss the playoffs. Strange, but true (Part IV): Four of the opening five minors assessed in this game were for tripping. Strange, but true (Part V): In 11 of the last 14 games, the Penguins have allowed three goals or fewer. But because the team generally lacks offence, it has a 3-4-1 record since the all-star break. Quick start: The Canadiens, a notoriously slow-starting team, began the game with five shots before three minutes had elapsed. Turnover of the night: Pittsburgh defenceman Kris Letang lost the puck to Matheson on the Canadiens’ only goal. He’s forgiven: Letang tied the score barely more than two minutes later. It was his eighth goal against Montreal in 44 career games. He scored his ninth into an empty net late in the third period. At least he had one good shift: In the game’s 16th minute, White lowered his shoulder and drove to the net, creating a scoring opportunity. Tanner Pearson then failed to convert the rebound. White had 11:11 of ice time, one shot, one hit and was a plus-1. Does he talk to his posts?: Cayden Primeau got his first start in net since shutting out Anaheim on Feb. 13. And he was undoubtedly pleased when Erik Karlsson hit the post in the opening period’s final minute. And again seven minutes into the middle frame, when Valtteri Puustinen did likewise. Pass of the night: Juraj Slafkovsky to Cole Caufield in the second period, while the Canadiens were on the power play. Caufield had what appeared to be a half-open net, yet goalie Tristan Jarry slid over and made a great blocker save. Struggling no more: The Penguins had converted only four of 25 manpower advantages this month. Six seconds following Brendan Gallagher ‘s holding penalty, Pittsburgh scored, a deflection by Bryan Rust. WTF: 21 seconds later, Drew O’Connor made it 3-1. Is the ice tilted?: Through 13 minutes of the final period, the Canadiens held a 10-1 shots advantage. But none of the shots resulted in scores. Stat of the night: Caufield and rookie Joshua Roy both were credited with five shots. It’s a crowded leaderboard: Caufield, Slafkovsky, Matheson, Nick Suzuki and Joel Armia all were minus-2. They said it: “It’s been a crazy day,” White told RDS during the pre-game warmup. “It’s an exciting day. Any time you get to play it’s fun. I’m a two-way player. Play good on the defensive end and hopefully get some chances off that. “It’s pretty exciting any time this happens,” White told reporters in Pittsburgh post-game. “Today I was just rolling with the punches and having fun with it. Skated this morning. Went home. It was a normal day. Then I got a call around 2:15. It has kind of been a whirlwind since then.” hzurkowsky@postmedia.com twitter.com/HerbZurkowsky1",

            "description": "Montreal-based studio Attraction is starting work on the French-language film for Netflix.",
            "content": "Article content You don’t know what you got ’til it’s gone. That’s a line from Big Yellow Taxi, Joni Mitchell’s classic 1970 hit, and it probably sums up what Montreal baseball fans were thinking this week when they heard the news that Netflix has commissioned a French-language documentary about the demise of the Montreal Expos . When our city’s Major League Baseball franchise slunk out of town in shady controversial fashion after the 2004 season, Montreal was greatly diminished. Yeah sure it’s just a pro sports team and yeah life goes on, but it was a sad day for the metropolis. In the two decades since, Montreal has mostly become a one-sport town or rather a one-team town. There is plenty of support for the Alouettes when they’re winning, like they did in dramatic fashion last season , and there’s a strong but vocal minority who love that soccer team that used to be called the Impact. But there is an unhealthy obsessive focus on the Montreal Canadiens here and life was just so much richer when there were two major-league franchises here to keep us on the North American sports map. Perry Giannias, the president of Expos Fest, has already been talking to folks at Attraction, the Montreal media company that’s producing the documentary on the Expos, helping connect them with former Expos players. Work is just beginning on the Netflix film and no one at Attraction was willing to talk about it this week, though director Jean-François Poisson did write to me to say the documentary won’t just be about the bitter end “but will allow fans to relive the great moments of the team, like 1994.” That of course was the year the Expos had the best record in Major League Baseball as of Aug. 12, the day the players went on strike and ended the season. “There’s still that desire to have a baseball team back,” said Giannias. “It goes back to that old adage ‘you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone.’ We unfortunately found that out a little later than sooner. Getting back a team is a lot harder than losing a team, it seems. I think people want the return of baseball and there’s a thirst for it. The Netflix (film) is going to be huge. It’s the first of its kind not only for Netflix but in French as well. I think it’s going to be a very big deal.” Montreal filmmaker Robbie Hart is just putting the finishing touches on another Expos documentary, Nos Amours — The Saga of the Montreal Expos, a sequel to his 2003 documentary Nos Amours. The new film, which will be released in theatres across Quebec in May, looks at the efforts over the past decade to try to bring baseball back to Montreal. That project collapsed in 2022 when Major League Baseball rejected the Tampa Bay Rays’ plan to split its games between Tampa and Montreal . “My old film was about trying to save them from leaving,” said Hart. “This new film is about trying to bring them back. But in this one it’s the Biblical story. It’s the whole ball of wax. It tells the untold story of trying to bring them back. It’s 10 years in the making. There’s two stories. The resurrection story and there’s the (overall) Biblical story, all intertwined.” In other words Hart’s film recounts the efforts from 2012 onward to revive the franchise but also goes all the way back to the beginnings of the Expos at Jarry Park in 1969, the team’s Book of Genesis if you will. Hollywood trade paper Variety broke the story of the Netflix Expos documentary and the Variety article states that “According to Netflix, the film explores the setbacks that led to the departure of the Expos from Montreal and how the loss of an MLB team in Montreal continues to spark debate 20 years later.” Hardcore Expos fan Giannias is happy to see two new documentaries coming on his beloved baseball team but he admits the films are bound to leave baseball fans here feeling a bit melancholic. “The way it was done to us and the way it was done to the (Quebec) Nordiques, it was eerily similar, a thieves in the night kind of deal,” said Giannias. “We share the same pain. Then you see a franchise like the Arizona Coyotes and how they’re holding on to a team. It’s disheartening to see how hard it is to get a team back. But we had so many great years here and developed so many great players. We still have more Hall of Famers in Cooperstown than the (Toronto) Blue Jays have. That tells you a lot.” bkelly@postmedia.com twitter.com/brendanshowbiz",

            "description": "Nick Suzuki, Cole Caufield and Juraj Slafkovsky are the strongest line Montreal has had in years, but can they lead us to the promised land?",
            "content": "Article content With the addition a couple of months back of Juraj Slafkovsky, it became clear the Canadiens finally had what could legitimately be called a first line. That’s great news. But the question now becomes — Is the Slafkovsky, Cole Caufield, Nick Suzuki trio good enough to be the first line on a team that could contend for the Stanley Cup? I know this outfit won’t be in the playoffs this year and won’t be contending for the Stanley Cup next season, though they could at least make a run for the playoffs. But the Jeff Gorton/Kent Hughes reconstruction is designed to have them become a perennial contender, so it’s fair to wonder if they can go deep in the post-season with Slaf, Caufield and Suzuki leading the charge. From what I heard from fans Wednesday night at McLean’s Pub, the debate isn’t over yet. Chris Scott thinks we do have that contending first line. “Slaf is looking good these days,” Scott said. “There’s a lot of debate about whether Suzuki is a 1C or 2C. But lately, in the past month or so, they’ve looked great.” But it’s one thing to look good in the regular season and another to shine in the playoffs. So can these three do it? “Suzuki’s been there, Caufield’s been there,” said Scott. And we both agreed that though Slafkovsky hasn’t been there, the guy is still a teenager and all signs point to him being the type of player who’ll step it up in the playoffs. But some still wonder if Caufield, with his size, will be able to keep the scoring coming when things tighten up and toughen up in the post-season. “I like Suzuki and Slaf but I’m not sure about Caufield yet,” said Brian Lajoie. “The real games are in the playoffs and it’s the playoffs that make me scared. It’s hard for small guys like that to play in the playoffs.” I think it’s a fair point. The fact is that the 5-foot-8 winger’s goal production is down significantly this season, showing that he is already having trouble scoring at the same pace as earlier in his career. Is that due to his size? Partly. It’s also partly due to the fact that other teams have figured out what he does. Caufield had, prior to the game against the Pittsburgh Penguins Thursday night, 19 goals in 56 games. That’s on pace to score around 27 goals this season. Last year, he scored 26 in 46 games, before a season-ending injury. That tally left him on pace to score 46 in a full 82-game schedule. People counter that he’s now doing other things better on the ice, that he’s better without the puck, to echo coach Martin St. Louis’s favourite expression. And that’s true. His defensive game has improved and he has more assists this season. For decades now, conservative Habs management hasn’t prioritizes pure offence, but nothing beats scoring goals. Caufield was given an eight-year US$62.8-million contract by Hughes because the GM thought he had an elite goal-scorer on his hands, not a 27-goal scorer. Others are less worried about Caufield and see a near-ideal first-line to compete for real in the playoffs. “We have a big talented player who can go into the corners (Slaf), we have a guy who can make the passes and we have an elite scorer,” said Joey Bienvenu. “If we give them a few years, for sure we have a real first line that can do some damage in the playoffs.” Marc-André Claveau makes the valid point that the line still has some work to do to become more responsibly defensively. “They’re the kind of line that when they’re in the offensive zone, they’re good, but they can get stuck in their own zone,” said Claveau. “So I think there’s still some work to do if we really want to have a great first line for the playoffs.” And that leads to maybe what’s the key point here. Clearly this is a more exciting first line than fans have seen in some time, but perhaps the most important factor here is coaching. It’s all about how far St. Louis can push these three young players to reach their collective ceiling. “They show flashes of brilliance and it’s showing that the team is coached much better than it has been in the past,” said Dave Lazar. “And I like the fact that I’m finally seeing some patience. Like let this guy play the way he’s supposed to play and see what happens. And it seems to be reaping a bit of reward.” Indeed it is. Now Hughes and Gorton have to figure out the other lines! bkelly@postmedia.com twitter.com/brendanshowbiz",

            "description": "The train cars and locomotives must be replaced or long-distance and inter-regional service will suffer, Via says.",
            "content": "Article content The smell of diesel greets reporters as they walk on an overhead passageway that overlooks a train yard on Ash St. in Pointe-St-Charles. Tucked away in a residential corner, the Via Rail maintenance centre is the indoor facility surrounded by Via’s train yard — a site most Montrealers have only ever glimpsed while driving on Gaétain-Laberge Blvd. or riding the REM between Central Station and Nuns’ Island. However, it is the largest of four facilities for repairing and refurbishing Via’s aging long-distance and intercity fleet. The train cars and locomotives here serve areas outside the Quebec-Windsor corridor, connecting smaller communities, providing essential service for remote areas, and making the long-distance trips between Montreal and Halifax and Toronto and Vancouver. It’s rare for journalists to get inside the train maintenance centre in action, and on this day there are about 30 reporters, photographers and camera operators getting a tour. The purpose is to highlight the work done by the Montreal crew, but there was also a clear agenda: to highlight the fact the aging equipment is coming to the end of its useful life. Via officials tell reporters that despite the great work of maintenance workers, they had to scrap 25 train cars after a recent inspection because they were too old. Other cars are likely to be called back at the next inspection, and the fleet is already not running at full capacity because the old cars have not been replaced. A long-distance train can pull as many as 20 passenger cars. “At a certain point, they have to be replaced. They’re about 75 years old. That’s more than double the lifespan of most other train cars,” Via Rail spokesperson Jean-Vincent Lacroix said. “We have to salute the work of the teams here who perform miracles, but these trains are at the end of their lifespan.” The situation is the same for the locomotives, which are a few years younger, Lacroix said. He explained that unlike the Quebec-Windsor corridor, which is in the process of being renewed at a cost of $1.5 billion, the future isn’t certain for the long-distance and regional trains, which are the less profitable part of Via’s business. “This is a determining year for Via,” he said. “If we’re not able to launch the call for tenders this year, there will be impacts on the service in the future years. We would like to mitigate this, and if there’s no replacement by 2035, it will be the end of the long-distance service for Via.” Entering the indoor facility, there’s another smell, that of burning metal as teams work to solder underneath the train cars suspended by jacks about five feet in the air and have had their wheels removed. A lot of banging is heard here and the buzzing of power tools. There’s a lot of history in this facility. Anyone who rode a long-distance train in their lifetime can probably find the car where they sat or the engine that pulled them here, or parked in the adjacent rail yard. VIA employees and other reporters reported a sense of nostalgia entering the dining cars and the company’s famous skyline dome car — a feature of the trip to Vancouver, as its upper level has seats underneath a large glass ceiling that offer passengers the best view of the Canadian Rockies. Reporters and photographers crammed into this car and each took a turn to mount the narrow stairway to get a view and take a photograph. On this day, a dining car was being refurbished. Reporters saw a kitchen and dining area that had been completely stripped on the interior, and then the new version of the same car with a working kitchen, grey tables and chairs with a grey carpet and grey pull-down blinds. “We’ve replaced the electric and air-conditioning systems,” said André Bouchard, the vice-president of mechanical services. “We also revamped the whole kitchen to make it more ergonomic for the health and safety of the chefs on board. It’s been updated to all the standards as well, but the goal is to ensure the safety of all passengers.” Most of the train cars were inherited by Via when the Crown Corporation was created in the 1980s. They date back to the 1940s and ’50s, when rail travel in Canada was one of the only ways to see the country at an affordable rate. Entering the cars transports riders to another time, with vintage posters advertising Canadian destinations and tables with checkerboards painted on them. Lacroix said long-distance rail travel remains popular among Canadians and tourists visiting the country for the first time, comparing the service with the Orleans Express in the U.S. jmagder@postmedia.com twitter.com/jasonmagder",

            "description": "CDPQ expects the cutbacks to generate annual savings of about $100 million from processes, resources and systems.",
            "content": "Article content Quebec’s public pension manager plans to cut a significant number of jobs in the real-estate subsidiaries it’s in the process of merging. “It’s inevitable that there will be job losses” in real estate, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec chief executive Charles Emond told reporters Thursday after CDPQ reported its 2023 results. CDPQ unveiled plans last month to bring real-estate subsidiaries Ivanhoé Cambridge and Otéra Capital under a single umbrella “to enable greater focus on investment expertise and generate agility and efficiency gains.” The integration drive, which should be completed by the end of 2025, is expected to generate annual savings of about $100 million from processes, resources and systems. Nathalie Palladitcheff, the Caisse’s top real-estate executive, will leave CDPQ at the end of the transition period. “Are we talking about dozens of job cuts? No. We’re talking about something that’s more substantial,” Emond said Thursday. “The $100-million figure won’t all come from job reductions, but it will probably be the most important factor. It’s about maximizing our performance for our depositors, at better cost.” Emond declined to give specifics on the magnitude of the cutbacks because the restructuring process is ongoing. Ivanhoé Cambridge has about 490 employees, compared with about 185 for Otéra Capital, a Caisse spokesperson said Thursday. Real estate was the worst performing of the Caisse’s major asset classes in 2023, posting a negative return of 6.2 per cent, according to a statement issued Thursday. CDPQ’s overall return was 7.2 per cent . The restructuring has nothing to do with the current economic downturn, Emond said. “This is not linked to the economic context at all,” he said. “This is strategic. There will be a greater potential as a result of this process.” Folding Ivanhoé Cambridge and Otéra into a single entity will relieve some Caisse executives from their current obligation of sitting on two separate boards or management committees, Emond said. Data collection is currently less than optimal because each unit uses different systems, he added. “It’s about freeing up hours and focusing on essential things,” the CEO said. “We are not doing this primarily for costs. Real estate is a people business. We will be less tied up in governance matters.” CDPQ will acquire all the interests held by minority shareholders in the share capital of Ivanhoé Cambridge and Otéra Capital as part of the restructuring — thereby becoming the sole shareholder. Minority investors currently own about three per cent of each real-estate unit, Emond said. “I want to be very clear. We are not dismantling Ivanhoe Cambridge or Otéra Capital,” he said. “These are organizations that have a good brand.” ftomesco@postmedia.com",

            "description": "The account advertising the tickets belonged to a friend, but had been hacked. Now Amanda Alderman is out $1,800.",
            "content": "Article content The drama surrounding tickets for Taylor Swift’s record-breaking Eras Tour continues: A Montreal woman was recently scammed while trying to help her friends secure seats for one of the singer’s November shows in Toronto. It was an elaborate ruse: the scammer wasn’t simply advertising tickets they didn’t have, which is a common tactic. In this case, they hacked into someone’s Facebook account and posed as that person to scam her friends, who had no idea they were speaking to a stranger. While not a Taylor Swift fan herself, Amanda Alderman saw her friend post she was selling tickets last week and relayed the information to her colleagues, a group of Montreal nurses, who wanted to attend the show but hadn’t been able to get tickets during the Ticketmaster sale. “So then I went back and forth — I was the link between the two of them,” Alderman said, adding that she has known the woman whose account posted about the tickets for decades. Everything seemed fine in the beginning, Alderman said. Speaking in a Messenger chat Alderman and her friend had previously used, the scammer said they were selling four tickets for $400 each, a price Alderman’s colleagues agreed to. They sent an e-transfer to an email with a name that didn’t match the seller’s, which Alderman said she didn’t register as a red flag because she figured that with a total of four tickets, someone else had made the initial purchase. Once the money had been accepted, Alderman said the seller requested contact information to transfer the tickets on Ticketmaster, and then said there appeared to be an additional $50 charge per person for the name change. Alderman decided to pay the fee herself — an extra $200 — and have her friends reimburse her once they received the tickets. “Then we waited, and then she started taking a while to answer, so now I started getting nervous,” Alderman said. “I wrote to her sister … and she said ‘this is a scammed account.’ They notified Facebook a week ago, and Facebook didn’t want to take the account down.” The post advertising the tickets, dated Feb. 15, was still up Tuesday evening. It was flagged as a scam by the Montreal Gazette and, just after noon on Wednesday, an automated “support message” indicated the platform would not be removing it. “We use a combination of technology and human reviewers to process reports and identify content that goes against our community standards,” the message read. “In this case, we did not remove the content you reported.” The post had been deleted by Wednesday afternoon (it’s unclear how or why it was taken down), but the hacked account remains active despite repeated attempts to flag the issue to Facebook, Alderman said. She added her friend has been made aware of at least one other person who was scammed thinking they were buying the nonexistent tickets. Since she facilitated the sale to her colleagues, Alderman decided to refund them herself. “So now I’m out of $1,800 for this whole scam,” she said. “Why I’m annoyed about this whole process is Facebook was made aware. … I wouldn’t be in this situation if Facebook just took the account down when they should have.” Requests for comment sent to both Facebook and Meta on Tuesday did not receive responses by Thursday afternoon. “I would never do this to someone … these scammers out there have no pity,” Alderman said. “I’ve had to sign up to all this overtime to pay this now. It’s like two months’ rent for me.” kthomas@postmedia.com",

            "description": "\"In a contact sport like hockey, you don't want to see it happen to anyone, but chances are it's going to happen,\" defenceman says.",
            "content": "Article content If Jordan Harris’s attitude seems cavalier, even bordering on brazen, it can probably be attributed to his having been concussed before. While he doesn’t brush off what he recently went through, the Canadiens defenceman says head injuries are part of the inherent dangers of playing professional sports. “It’s just kind of what you sign up for,” Harris said Tuesday, after practice, the first time he addressed the media following his health scare and before he returned to the lineup Wednesday night, against Buffalo . “We’re able to play this sport every single day. You ask around the locker room and in hockey, in general, a lot of people have had concussions, little dings, had their bell rung. “It happens in a contact sport like hockey. You don’t want to see it happen to anyone, but chances are it’s going to happen when you play this long, against the size and strength of the players we play against. You just try to take care of yourself. If you’re proactive, taking vitamins and treating your body well, that will help with the recovery process. And you hope you don’t have (symptoms) down the road.” Barely five minutes had elapsed of a Feb. 11 Bell Centre game against St. Louis when Harris, behind his own net, appeared to be falling. At the same time, Blues forward Sammy Blais checked Harris from behind, taking him into the boards head-first. Harris was slow to get up and appeared punch-drunk, was assisted to the dressing room and didn’t return. Blais received a five-minute major and game misconduct. Harris, 23, still had a small bruise on his right cheek on Tuesday. He received three stitches to his lower lip, another three inside his mouth. He hasn’t watched a replay and says he probably won’t. His mother, Virginia, a nurse at Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital, and girlfriend, Codie Cross, a former defenceman at Northeastern University — where they met — were both in attendance. Harris said Blais contacted him, apologizing. “Honestly, it could have been so much worse,” said Harris, 5-foot-11 and 189 pounds. “You can break down that stuff and throw it into slow motion. It happened so quick. It’s hockey. It’s unfortunate what happened. At least I didn’t lose any teeth. Some people deal with concussion symptoms for weeks and months. I’m just happy to be back. “I don’t think (Blais) meant any ill will,” added Harris, selected by Montreal in the third round (71st overall) in 2018. “There’s a lot of good guys in this league. It’s hockey. It’s unfortunate. Blais was committed to the hit. I remember being aware that somebody was coming to hit me. He probably wanted to get a hit in and get into the game. It’s totally understandable.” Harris said his condition began improving the day following the game and any post-concussion symptoms disappeared within 48 hours. He suffered his first concussion as a senior at Northeastern in 2021. “Honestly, I really wasn’t concerned,” Harris said of his most recent injury. “You just want to make sure you take the right steps.” Harris was teamed with fellow Northeastern alumni Jayden Struble against the Sabres. Harris played 15:28 against Buffalo over 17 shifts. He had a goal and six points in 32 games prior to the Canadiens meeting the Penguins in Pittsburgh on Thursday night. Note: The Canadiens claimed 27-year-old centre Colin White off waivers from Pittsburgh on Thursday afternoon. The 6-foot-1, 194-pounder has 44-69-113 totals in 303 games over eight seasons with the Senators, Panthers and Penguins. hzurkowsky@postmedia.com twitter.com/HerbZurkowsky1",

            "content": "Article content Students picketed outside Premier François Legault’s Montreal office Thursday to continue pressuring the government to rescind its planned 33-per-cent tuition hike for out-of-province students at English universities. Students Against Tuition Hikes, an alliance of various student groups from both McGill and Concordia universities, said in a statement ahead of the demonstration that the planned tuition increase amounts to an “attack on accessible and high-quality education in Quebec.” “It is unacceptable that anglophone institutions are being targeted by this policy,” the group said. “If enacted, this policy would prevent prospective out-of-province or international students from lower-income backgrounds from attending these institutions, further intensifying elitism.” The Coalition Avenir Québec government has said the hike is needed to better fund French universities and control the amount of English spoken on Montreal streets. Despite the outcry since the announcement and its own advisory committee urging it to scrap the plan, the CAQ has shown no intention of reversing course for McGill and Concordia. Bishop’s, a small university in Sherbrooke, has been given a partial exemption. Students Against Tuition Hikes is calling for people to stand in solidarity with students, “acknowledging that this isn’t merely a student issue: It is an attack on the very foundation of accessible education for all.” “Those who value equitable education are encouraged to join our cause, support demonstrations, wear the red square and amplify the message across the country,” it said in its statement. “The diversity and richness of Quebec’s educational landscape is at stake, and these hikes must not be allowed to hinder the progress of our academic institutions.”",

Serge Brouillard told a coroner’s inquest Thursday he had expected a complaint filed with police by another family member would have led to his son getting the help he needed. On March 27, 2023, Breau and three other officers showed up to Isaac Brouillard Lessard’s apartment to arrest him for uttering threats and for breaking probation. The 35-year-old stabbed Breau to death and seriously injured her partner at the home in Louiseville, about 100 kilometres northeast of Montreal. He was shot dead by police moments later. Serge Brouillard described his son as an intelligent lover of nature who played high-level soccer as a youth and was always ready to help others around him. But Brouillard says his son suffered from mental illness and that he fell through the cracks in the health system. Coroner Géhane Kamel told the father Thursday that since the beginning of the inquiry, at least six families have written to her to say they sympathized with him and were dealing with a similar situation.",

            "description": "We question how they can balance the concerns of commuters with the needs of the unhoused in the Montreal métro.",
            "content": "Article content Among the crowds at métro stations, you may have recently noted several people wearing distinctive blue shirts. Neither special constables nor métro operators, these individuals are known as “safety ambassadors.” They’re part of a Société de transport de Montréal (STM) program launched on Jan. 25. Trained to provide customer assistance and relay safety issues to security, the safety ambassadors aim to address the growing unease of station-users . But exactly who among the station-users are they prioritizing? As students in the master of science in public health program at McGill University, we are concerned the STM’s new safety efforts will create further harm to unhoused station-users during a housing and opioid crisis. A 2021 report found that nearly 40 per cent of tickets issued in recent years by STM special constables were to unhoused people. Not only does ticketing discourage the existence of unhoused people in and around the stations, but the financial penalties sink these groups further into poverty. By adding more eyes and ears to métro stations, we will inevitably see an increase in interactions between vulnerable people and security personnel. Unlike police, these safety ambassadors cannot issue tickets and are trained to “check in” with vulnerable people. However, they will call for police support if the situation is beyond their capacity. Even if most check-ins do not end with police intervention, every additional interaction that leads to ticketing or arrest is another opportunity for harm. These safety ambassadors are only one element in the STM’s approach . They’ve also hired social workers to respond to specific crises in collaboration with the ambassadors and special constables. While we welcome the involvement of social workers, these mixed squads adhere to the same objective of protecting fare revenue and the interests of métro users. Recent research shows that these mixed squads interfere with the operations of street outreach groups not affiliated with the STM. Once unhoused individuals have been exposed to law enforcement in support settings, it becomes a challenge to separate the feeling of being watched from the feeling of being helped. As a result, these community organizations noted a drop in trust with their staff and reduced engagement in their services. Finally, we question how the safety ambassadors can balance the concerns of commuters with the needs of the unhoused. Ideally, individuals who are unhoused will seek help through a shelter where permanent housing, counselling and support are provided. Instead, many shelters are resource-strapped and must turn people away , particularly in the winter months. Without a warm, safe space to rest, the métro remains the only place for refuge. What happens if a commuter complains to safety ambassadors about a person using drugs in the station? Based on the program’s description, these ambassadors can direct people to social support services. But where else can they be referred to beyond what already exists and is deemed over-capacitated or unsafe? With all other options exhausted, these individuals will likely be directed to leave the station. The STM described its plan as a necessary tool for adapting to the social realities brought on by the pandemic. However, what is needed are solutions, not adaptation. If the STM is invested in improving métro safety, it should take action to improve the welfare of the most at-risk station-users. It should evaluate the impact of the new program on perceptions of safety — not just for commuters, but for those who are using the station as shelter. Beyond the STM, resources should be funnelled back into the community to invest in safe, stable and permanent housing and addictions care to reduce the number of vulnerable people forced to rest in métro stations. Until we prioritize the needs of these marginalized communities, we will never achieve safety in the stations. Clare McGall, Danielle Duncan, Valerie Jeanneret and Holly Arscott are master of science in public health (MScPH) students at McGill University.",

            "description": "France Bélisle's resignation is effective immediately, to \"preserve my health for the future\" and \"preserve my integrity.\"",
            "content": "Article content Gatineau Mayor France Bélisle on Thursday announced she was resigning from her post, citing the increasingly difficult climate for municipal politicians in the province. Bélisle’s voice was laden with emotion as she told reporters she is quitting to “preserve my health for the future” and “preserve my integrity.” As she described her role as mayor as being at once the most magnificent and most difficult of her lifetime, she also warned the provincial government to consider the “exodus of municipal politicians, as well as all the elections by acclamation.” “I think everyone should be worried when public service is no longer popular,” she said. Bélisle’s resignation is immediate and she will be replaced for the moment by city councillor Daniel Champagne. Bélisle was elected Gatineau’s first female mayor in 2021. In a statement, Union des municipalités du Québec president Martin Damphousse described her as “determined, driven by a duty to be involved an endowed with deep values. “Her openness and empathy made her a notable figure in the municipal world, always ready to make changes and defend the values of equality and social causes, even in the most difficult circumstances.” Quebec Premier François Legault took to social media to salute Bélisle, thanking her for her service and wishing her well. André Fortin, the Liberal MNA who represents the riding of Pontiac, also expressed his respects. “She moved our city forward. While she leaves with a heavy heart, she can also do so with her head held high.”",

            "description": "“I don’t think it’s the presence of these students that transforms the French-speaking face of Montreal.”",
            "content": "Article content The Legault government’s decision to target university students from other provinces has “harmed” Montreal, the rector of Université de Montréal says. Daniel Jutras also says students from the rest of Canada aren’t making Montreal less French, and the decision to target Concordia and McGill won’t help French universities much. He made the comments in an interview published Thursday by La Presse. The criticism comes two weeks after Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said a 33-per-cent tuition hike for out-of-province students “ directly attacks Montreal .” Higher Education Minister Pascale Déry has said the tuition increase will help boost funding for French universities and reduce the number of non-French-speakers in Montreal’s post-secondary institutions. Most university students from the rest of Canada who come to Quebec study at Concordia and McGill, both of which are in Montreal. French Language Minister Jean-François Roberge has complained that too much English is being spoken on the streets of Montreal , with non-French-speaking university students partly to blame. “I think it harmed Montreal,” Jutras said of the negative signals the Coalition Avenir Québec government sent to young people from other provinces who help contribute to the vitality of the province’s university campuses. As for the state of French in Montreal, he said: “I don’t think it’s the presence of these students that transforms the French-speaking face of Montreal.” Quebec has said the plan will help redistribute about $100 million to French universities. But Jutras, a former dean of McGill’s law school, said what the CAQ government has done “is not going to move the needle much, honestly.” He said the significant decrease recorded by Concordia and McGill in applications from the rest of Canada means the government may take in less than expected. And the money would simply be a transfer from English universities to French universities, when what is needed is more money for the entire system. Quebec universities are chronically underfunded, Jutras said, blaming the province’s tuition rates, among the lowest in Canada. Between 2001 and 2018, operating resources per student decreased by 10 per cent in Quebec, even as it increased by three per cent in the rest of Canada, he said. Jutras pointed to a 2021 study that suggested $1.2 billion in additional funding would be needed to bring Quebec universities up to par with those in the rest of Canada. In October, Jutras was one of five leaders of French post-secondary institutions who penned an open letter criticizing the tuition plan. They said it would do little to help francophone universities while endangering anglophone ones and sending a harmful message to students from elsewhere. The Université de Montréal, a highly ranked French institution, has 67,000 students, including those at the HEC Montréal business school and the Polytechnique Montréal engineering school. ariga@postmedia.com",

            "content": "Article content The man who was charged with killing his mother and another woman in Vaudreuil-Dorion last week was ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment on Thursday after a doctor determined he is still unfit to appear in court. Quebec Court Judge Bertrand St-Arnaud issued the order at the Valleyfield courthouse after he received the results of a five-day evaluation Fabio Puglisi, 44, was ordered to undergo at the Philippe Pinel Institute at the end of last week. The judge placed the report under seal but said the psychiatrist who examined Puglisi determined he is currently unable to follow a simple court proceeding. While the judge had the option of ordering that Puglisi undergo treatment for a period of 60 days, he opted instead for 30 days. Defence lawyer Alexandre Dubé and prosecutor Hélène Langis agreed with the court order. “You will work with the doctors at the hospital and we will see you in a month,” the judge told Puglisi. Puglisi is alleged to have killed his mother, Élisabetta Puglisi-Caucci, 68, and a 53-year-old woman named Manon Blanchard and was charged with two counts of second-degree murder. Both women were stabbed on Thursday inside a large condo building on Émile-Bouchard St. A 70-year-old woman was also attacked, but she managed to survive despite suffering serious injuries. Puglisi is charged with the attempted murder and aggravated assault of that woman. Puglisi has a history of mental health problems and was declared not criminally responsible twice in two previous criminal court cases. The case returns to court on March 25. pcherry@postmedia.com",

            "description": "Losing both of them for extended periods limited line combinations head coach Martin St. Louis could tinker with during rebuilding process.",
            "content": "Article content The Canadiens’ rebuilding plans for this season hit a Montreal-sized pothole in the second game when Kirby Dach suffered a season-ending knee injury. In what has become a regular thing in Montreal — both on the ice and on the streets — there was another big pothole waiting in the 23rd game when Alex Newhook suffered a high ankle sprain that would sideline him for 27 games. Dach and Newhook, both 23, are big building blocks in the Canadiens’ rebuilding plans. They were both acquired by GM Kent Hughes, who gave up first- and third-round draft picks to get Dach from the Chicago Blackhawks two summers ago and gave up first- and second-round picks to get Newhook from the Colorado Avalanche last summer. Losing both of them for extended periods limited the line combinations head coach Martin St. Louis could tinker with in the rebuilding process. It looks now like the Canadiens could have a No. 1 line for the foreseeable future with captain Nick Suzuki between Cole Caufield and Juraj Slafkovsky. Suzuki is the oldest member of that trio at 24. Dach and Newhook could be together on the No. 2 line next season with the third spot open for competition. Candidates could include Josh Anderson (if he can find his game again), 20-year-old Joshua Roy, or another young player similar to Dach and Newhook that Hughes might acquire before the start of next season. The Anaheim Ducks’ Trevor Zegras could be available on the trade market and would be a very interesting addition. He’s only 22, is a close friend of Caufield and was his teammate in the USA Hockey National Team Development Program. “I think we were playing well in the games that we had together to start the year,” the left-shot Newhook said after practice Tuesday in Brossard when asked about the possibility of having Dach as a linemate next season. “Guys kind of work off each other and with my speed and his size it can go well together. Lefty, righty, who can both take draws. I really enjoyed playing with him. I think it’s definitely a possibility moving forward.” It will be interesting to watch Roy as he continues to develop. He had two assists in Wednesday night’s 3-2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres at the Bell Centre and has 1-4-5 totals in 11 games with the Canadiens after posting 13-19-32 totals in 40 games as an AHL rookie with the Laval Rocket. “He’s pretty mature away from the puck,” St. Louis said about Roy. “His details away from the puck and positioning. I think that allows him to get more touches because of it. Defensively, I feel he’s in a good spot. Very intelligent on the ice and I think the more reps he gets his touches are going to keep improving. It’s just a matter of a young guy getting more experience in this league. But what I’ve seen so far, it’s very encouraging.” Adam Nicholas, the Canadiens’ director of hockey development, has described Roy as a “very cerebral” player. Roy was the No. 1 overall pick at the 2019 QMJHL Draft by the Saint John Sea Dogs, but struggled early in his junior career, which is why he was still available when the Canadiens selected him in the fifth round (150th overall) at the 2021 NHL Draft. The next season, Roy led the QMJHL in scoring with 51-68-119 totals in 66 games with the Sherbrooke Phoenix. Roy won back-to-back gold medals with Team Canada at the 2022 and 2023 world junior championships. Connor Bedard , selected No. 1 overall by the Chicago Blackhawks at last year’s NHL Draft, called Roy one of the smartest linemates he ever played with after they won gold together with Team Canada in 2023. As for Newhook, he is happy to be back on the ice after recovering from the most severe injury of his career. He has 1-2-3 totals in six games since returning to the lineup and has points in three of the last four games after picking up an assist against the Sabres. With 8-8-16 totals in 29 games overall, Newhook is on a pace that would see him score 23 goals over a full 82-game season. To highlight how much the Canadiens forwards struggle to score as a group, only four teammates have more goals than Newhook despite all the games he has missed: Suzuki (20), Caufield (19), Slafkovsky (12) and Joel Armia (9). “I think we got a lot of great pieces,” Newhook said. “If you look at our team, we’re still a little young compared to some of the top teams in the league now. But I think all the teams that are at the top had to go through a phase where their top guys were young and their core was young. I think that’s kind of where we’re at right now. But I have faith in everyone in this room, I have faith in the core guys that have been here and will be here for the next few years. I think next year having everyone healthy will be huge, hopefully. Get back into it and start competing and know where we can be.” scowan@postmedia.com twitter.com/StuCowan1",

            "description": "The premier says he will soon meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to discuss the pressure being exerted on Quebec's health, education and social services by asylum seekers.",
            "content": "Article content QUEBEC — Ensuring Quebecers have access to subsidized daycare first, before asylum seekers, is a question of common sense, Premier François Legault said Thursday. And Legault says he will be meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the coming weeks to discuss the pressure being exerted on Quebec’s health, education and social services by the massive arrival of asylum seekers. Quebec says the bill to pay for those services has now hit $1 billion . “The Court of Appeal, a federal court, has said we are obliged to provide subsidized daycare services to asylum seekers when we are unable to provide services to Quebec citizens,” Legault told reporters arriving for question period Thursday. “But subsidized services should be offered first to Quebec citizens. There is a shortage of places now. We are in the process of reducing the waiting lists. “This is a question of common sense.” Legault was reacting to Quebec’s decision to seek leave from the Supreme Court to appeal a Feb. 7 Quebec Court of Appeal decision that found the province’s daycare rules are discriminatory. The court ruled that asylum seekers who hold valid work permits are entitled to register their children in Quebec’s public daycares. But Quebec’s decision and Legault’s comments irked the three opposition leaders who earlier said asylum seekers should have access. In a week when tensions between his government and Ottawa rose over the issue of asylum seekers and border controls, Legault added his voice, saying Quebec is carrying too heavy a burden and he intends to tell the prime minister. Earlier this week, four Legault cabinet ministers held a news conference to increase pressure to act to tighten border controls and better distribute asylum seekers in other provinces. They said Quebec has received 55 per cent of asylum seekers, well over its share of the rest of the country. In 2023, that number represented 160,651 people. Legault also responded to Trudeau’s Quebec lieutenant, Pablo Rodriquez, who said Ottawa already channels $750 million to Quebec to help cover the costs of asylum seekers. Legault noted that money is already earmarked for regular immigrants and is of no help to the cover the costs of asylum seekers who are considered temporary immigrants. But Rodriguez invited Quebec to talk about the issue at the table and not via the media. pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/philipauthier",

The demo was blocking access to McGill University’s Bronfman Building on Sherbrooke St. W. The demonstration drew the attention of B’nai Brith Canada and local Liberal MP Marc Miller, both of whom called for the demonstrators to clear access to the building. Police said demonstrators showed up at the site at about 8:30 a.m. and by 11:30 a.m. the protesters numbered about 100. The demonstration thus far had been peaceful, police said, with no arrests reported. The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs said: “Antisemitism on university campuses, including McGill, has reached alarming levels. This morning it resulted in a mob blockading the Bronfman Building.”",

            "description": "Michel Langlois stabbed 27-year-old Justyna Kozyra 14 times outside her apartment building in September 2011.",
            "content": "Article content A man who killed a young woman in Dollard-des-Ormeaux during an argument over where she let her dog do its business asked the Parole Board of Canada on Thursday morning to release him on day parole. Michel Langlois, 62, had a long exchange with parole board member Joseph Laine during a parole hearing held through a videoconference before he was informed that the board will deliberate before announcing its decision in the coming days. Evans Bédard, the other parole board member who heard Langlois’s case, said the crime Langlois committed was very serious and that it would take a while before a decision can be reached. The parole board can deliberate for 15 days before reaching a decision, but Bédard told Langlois to expect to wait much less than that. Langlois’s parole officer recommended he be granted day parole and released to a halfway house in Laval for six months. She said his risk of reoffending was recently assessed as being low to moderate. “He realizes now his inability to control his emotions is what caused the death,” the parole officer said. On Sept. 8, 2011, Langlois stabbed 27-year-old Justyna Kozyra 14 times outside her apartment building on Brunswick Blvd. Kozyra was involved in an argument with Langlois’s boyfriend, the concierge of a neighbouring building, when Langlois joined in and stabbed her using a knife he was using to do some gardening that day. Langlois’s boyfriend and Kozyra had argued before over how she let her dog relieve himself on the grounds outside both buildings. The concierge was responsible for maintaining both. On Feb. 1, 2013, Langlois pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. He automatically received a life sentence and he was ordered to serve at least 10 years behind bars before becoming eligible for parole. In 2022, he was scheduled to have his first parole hearing, but he cancelled it at the last minute. On Thursday, Langlois told the board Kozyra’s death had more to do with his inability to control his emotions than dog poop. “I had accumulated too much frustration,” Langlois said when asked what happened the day he killed Kozyra. “I didn’t know how to control my emotions. “I wasn’t good in my own skin. It’s difficult to explain. I wasn’t well.” Langlois said that before he killed Kozyra he went to a hospital to seek help for his inability to control his emotions but was told his issue couldn’t be diagnosed at that institution. He also said he felt his boyfriend was getting the run-around when he called the police and Dollard-des-Ormeaux’s public security to report the problem with the dog. Langlois has taken dozens of leaves from the penitentiary where he is incarcerated and used them to do work for charities distributing food to needy people in Laval and Montreal. The leaves, designed to prepare him for parole, were carried out without incident, the parole officer said. She recommended that two conditions be imposed on Langlois’s release. One is that he be required to take medication he is currently using to help control his emotions. The other is that he not communicate with Kozrya’s relatives. “I don’t even remember her family name,” Langlois said while trying to reassure the board he has no intention of contacting the woman’s loved ones. Laine suggested that the board might add a condition that Langlois follow psychological counselling while he is out on day parole. pcherry@postmedia.com",

            "content": "Article content Double-digit gains in publicly traded stocks helped the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec shake off its worst performance since the global financial crisis by posting a 7.2-per-cent return in 2023. Quebec’s public pension manager generated net investment income of $28 billion last year, which pushed net assets to $434 billion by Dec. 31, according to a press statement issued Thursday morning. The return contrasts with the negative annual return of 5.6 per cent that the Caisse reported in 2022 as equity and bond markets corrected simultaneously. Some of the Caisse’s peers fared even better in 2023. The Caisse said its own benchmark index gained 7.3 per cent, while Canada’s defined-benefit pension plans returned 9.1 per cent on average, according to a January calculation by RBC Investor and Treasury Services. Over five years, the Caisse’s annualized return stands at 6.4 per cent, outpacing the benchmark portfolio’s 5.9-per-cent advance. Its annualized return over 10 years is 7.4 per cent, which also tops the benchmark portfolio’s 6.5-per-cent increase. Publicly traded equities provided the biggest boost to the Caisse’s portfolio in 2023, climbing 17.7 per cent amid gains by growth stocks and several Quebec companies. Private equity returned one per cent, while fixed income added 8.1 per cent as government debt rebounded. Real assets advanced 2.2 per cent, paced by a 9.6-per-cent return in infrastructure. Real estate, meanwhile, posted a 6.2-per-cent loss. This report will be updated. ftomesco@postmedia.com",

            "description": "\"Austerity is out of the question,\" François Legault says of Quebec's 2024-25 budget, which will be presented March 12.",
            "content": "Article content QUEBEC — The Legault government will present its spring budget Tuesday March 12. Finance Minister Eric Girard made the announcement Thursday as he arrived for question period at the National Assembly. “The priorities will be health care and education,” Girard told reporters. “I think this is a budget where we want to make a difference for citizens. We want to improve services. “We’ve invested in labour negotiations. we’ve invested in improving the conditions of our workers. We’re moving forward,” he said. The budget will cover the 2024-2025 period and is Girard’s sixth budget as minister. Analysts say it will probably his most difficult. Girard downplayed that idea. “There seems to be a lot of concern on how this budget will be for me,” he said. “I can tell you, every budget is difficult. It’s an important duty that I take seriously. “But yes, this will be a difficult budget. But I have yet to see an easy budget.” He denied there are any plans to cut services, even if government revenues are down and spending way up. Already cash-strapped because of an anemic economy , Girard has to figure out a way to pay recently negotiated wage increases for the public sector. That’s because what started as a 10.3-per-cent increase over five years wound up, after long negotiations , being 18.6 per cent over five years. If the government had included the amounts to pay this bill in its 2023 budget, it was well concealed to not show its cards in advance of talks. Today, Girard has the invoice on his desk — it was in the $11-billion range back in December — with big decisions to make on how to pay it. His boss, Premier François Legault, has already indicated he does not want to cut spending on items like health and education, which means it will have to turn to other sectors. But where? Legault also does not want to increase taxes, because he says he got into politics determined to reduce them. Challenged by Québec solidaire co-spokesperson Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois this week to promise no austerity measures — a word the government is allergic to because of past connotations — Legault bristled. “Austerity is out of the question,” Legault responded. “Cutting services is out of the question. Orange taxes are out of the question. Increasing income taxes is out of the question.” That appears to mean some friction between Legault and Girard, a former Bank of Canada economist who is considered more fiscally conservative than Legault, who has moved his party into the middle over the years. In explaining recent contracts with Quebec teachers Sunday, Legault said Quebec chose to invest “massively in public services.” “It will have financial consequences,” Legault said. “We will wind up with a budget that will be largely deficitary … much more than it was before the negotiations.” He has since taken heat because some interpreted the comments as him saying the deficit is the fault of the unions, something he has denied repeatedly. In his 2023-2024 budget, Girard estimated the deficit for the year would be $4.1 billion. He also insisted Quebec was on track to balance the books by 2027-2028. That plan now appears to be up in the air. Girard is expected to present a bigger deficit and push into the future the magic date where the books balance. He has already warned the situation is not ideal . “It’s mathematical,” Girard said at a party caucus meeting in Sherbrooke in January. “At this stage, the deficits will be more significant.” pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/philipauthier",

That assessment was delivered Thursday by the official opposition Quebec Liberals in the National Assembly just one day after Premier François Legault was obliged to defend a project that has become a rallying point for his political opponents. Radio-Canada reported on Wednesday that scientific rationale that had been used months earlier in an environmental assessment to block a proposed real- estate project from the site now occupied by Northvolt had disappeared from a subsequent examination of the battery plant’s feasibility. The ensuing flurry of questions to Legault led the premier to resort to displaying fruit — specifically an apple, an orange and and banana — in an effort to explain to journalists that to compare the two assessments was to compare apples and oranges. Legault’s attempt to explain his government’s position led the Parti Québécois to accuse him of ignoring Quebecers’ intelligence and treating them “like children.”",
