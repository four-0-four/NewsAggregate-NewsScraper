            "content": "WASHINGTON -- One woman miscarried in the lobby restroom of a Texas emergency room as front desk staff refused to check her in. Another woman learned that her fetus had no heartbeat at a Florida hospital, the day after a security guard turned her away from the facility. And in North Carolina, a woman gave birth in a car after an emergency room couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died. Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, federal documents obtained by The Associated Press reveal. The cases raise alarms about the state of emergency pregnancy care in the U.S., especially in states that enacted strict abortion laws and sparked confusion around the treatment doctors can provide. \u201cIt is shocking, it\u2019s absolutely shocking,\u201d said Amelia Huntsberger, an OB/GYN in Oregon. \u201cIt is appalling that someone would show up to an emergency room and not receive care -- this is inconceivable.\u201d It's happened despite federal mandates that the women be treated. Federal law requires emergency rooms to treat or stabilize patients who are in active labor and provide a medical transfer to another hospital if they don\u2019t have the staff or resources to treat them. Medical facilities must comply with the law if they accept Medicare funding. The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday that could weaken those protections. The Biden administration has sued Idaho over its abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, arguing it conflicts with the federal law. \u201cNo woman should be denied the care she needs,\u201d Jennifer Klein, director of the White House Gender Policy Council, said in a statement. \u201cAll patients, including women who are experiencing pregnancy-related emergencies, should have access to emergency medical care required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).\u201d Pregnant patients have \u201cbecome radioactive to emergency departments\u201d in states with extreme abortion restrictions, said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor. \u201cThey are so scared of a pregnant patient, that the emergency medicine staff won\u2019t even look. They just want these people gone,\" Rosenbaum said. Consider what happened to a woman who was nine months pregnant and having contractions when she arrived at the Falls Community Hospital in Marlin, Texas, in July 2022, a week after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on abortion. The doctor on duty refused to see her. \u201cThe physician came to the triage desk and told the patient that we did not have obstetric services or capabilities,\u201d hospital staff told federal investigators during interviews, according to documents. \u201cThe nursing staff informed the physician that we could test her for the presence of amniotic fluid. However, the physician adamantly recommended the patient drive to a Waco hospital.\u201d Investigators with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services concluded Falls Community Hospital broke the law. Reached by phone, an administrator at the hospital declined to comment on the incident. The investigation was one of dozens the AP obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request filed in February 2023 that sought all pregnancy-related EMTALA complaints the previous year. One year after submitting the request, the federal government agreed to release only some complaints and investigative documents filed across just 19 states. The names of patients, doctors and medical staff were redacted from the documents. Federal investigators looked into just over a dozen pregnancy-related complaints in those states during the months leading up to the U.S. Supreme Court's pivotal ruling on abortion in 2022. But more than two dozen complaints about emergency pregnancy care were lodged in the months after the decision was unveiled. It is not known how many complaints were filed last year as the records request only asked for 2022 complaints and the information is not publicly available otherwise. The documents did not detail what happened to the patient turned away from the Falls Community Hospital. Other pregnancies ended in catastrophe, the documents show. At Sacred Heart Emergency Center in Houston, front desk staff refused to check in one woman after her husband asked for help delivering her baby that September. She miscarried in a restroom toilet in the emergency room lobby while her husband called 911 for help. \u201cShe is bleeding a lot and had a miscarriage,\u201d the husband told first responders in his call, which was transcribed from Spanish in federal documents. \u201cI\u2019m here at the hospital but they told us they can\u2019t help us because we are not their client.\u201d Emergency crews, who arrived 20 minutes later and transferred the woman to a hospital, appeared confused over the staff's refusal to help the woman, according to 911 call transcripts. One first responder told federal investigators that when a Sacred Heart Emergency Center staffer was asked about the gestational age of the fetus, the staffer replied: \u201cNo, we can\u2019t tell you, she is not our patient. That\u2019s why you are here.\u201d A manager for Sacred Heart Emergency Center declined to comment. The facility is licensed in Texas as a freestanding emergency room, which means it is not physically connected to a hospital. State law requires those facilities to treat or stabilize patients, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services agency said in an email to AP. Sacred Heart Emergency\u2019s website says that it no longer accepts Medicare, a change that was made sometime after the woman miscarried, according to publicly available archives of the center's website. Meanwhile, the staff at Person Memorial Hospital in Roxboro, North Carolina, told a pregnant woman, who was complaining of stomach pain, that they would not be able to provide her with an ultrasound. The staff failed to tell her how risky it could be for her to depart without being stabilized, according to federal investigators. While en route to another hospital 45 minutes away, the woman gave birth in a car to a baby who did not survive. Person Memorial Hospital self-reported the incident. A spokeswoman said the hospital continues to \u201cprovide ongoing education for our staff and providers to ensure compliance.\u201d In Melbourne, Florida, a security guard at Holmes Regional Medical Center refused to let a pregnant woman into the triage area because she had brought a child with her. When the patient came back the next day, medical staff were unable to locate a fetal heartbeat. The center declined to comment on the case. Emergency rooms are subject to hefty fines when they turn away patients, fail to stabilize them or transfer them to another hospital for treatment. Violations can also put hospitals' Medicare funding at risk. But it\u2019s unclear what fines might be imposed on more than a dozen hospitals that the Biden administration says failed to properly treat pregnant patients in 2022. It can take years for fines to be levied in these cases. The Health and Human Services agency, which enforces the law, declined to share if the hospitals have been referred to the agency's Office of Inspector General for penalties. For Huntsberger, the OB-GYN, EMTALA was one of the few ways she felt protected to treat pregnant patients in Idaho, despite the state's abortion ban. She left Idaho last year to practice in Oregon because of the ban. The threat of fines or loss of Medicare funding for violating EMTALA is a big deterrent that keeps hospitals from dumping patients, she said. Many couldn't keep their doors open if they lost Medicare funding. She has been waiting to see how HHS penalizes two hospitals in Missouri and Kansas that HHS announced last year it was investigating after a pregnant woman, who was in preterm labor at 17 weeks, was denied an abortion. \u201cA lot of these situations are not reported, but even the ones that are \u2014 like the cases out of the Midwest \u2014 they're investigated but nothing really comes of it,\u201d Huntsberger said. \u201cPeople are just going to keep providing substandard care or not providing care. The only way that changes is things like this.\u201d President Joe Biden and top U.S. health official Xavier Becerra have both publicly vowed vigilance in enforcing the law. Even as states have enacted strict abortion laws, the White House has argued that if hospitals receive Medicare funds they must provide stabilizing care, including abortions. In a statement to the AP, Becerra called it the \u201cnation's bedrock law protecting Americans' right to life- and health-saving emergency medical care.\u201d \u201cAnd doctors, not politicians, should determine what constitutes emergency care,\" he added. Idaho\u2019s law allows abortion only if the life, not the health, of the mother is at risk. But the state's attorney general has argued that its abortion ban is \u201cconsistent\u201d with federal law, which calls for emergency rooms to protect an unborn child in medical emergencies. \"The Biden administration has no business rewriting federal law to override Idaho\u2019s law and force doctors to perform abortions,\u201d Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador said in a statement earlier this year. Now, the Supreme Court will weigh in. The case could have implications in other states like Arizona, which is reinstating an 1864 law that bans all abortions, with an exception only if the mother's life is at risk. EMTALA was initially introduced decades ago because private hospitals would dump patients on county or state hospitals, often because they didn\u2019t have insurance, said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas of the American Civil Liberties Union. Some hospitals also refused to see pregnant women when they did not have an established relationship with physicians on staff. If the court nullifies or weakens those protections, it could result in more hospitals turning away patients without fear of penalty from the federal government, she said. \u201cThe government knows there\u2019s a problem and is investigating and is doing something about that,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas said. \u201cWithout EMTALA, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-19 15:55:00",
            "content": "Shortages of popular weight loss medications are continuing amid an all-time high of drug scarcity in the United States. Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk, and Zepbound, made by Eli Lilly & Co., are in tight supply and may be hard to obtain for the next several months, according to the pharmaceutical companies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its drug shortage database on Wednesday to reflect that most doses of Zepbound have limited availability due to \"demand increase for the drug.\" MORE: Drug shortage can put patients' lives at risk, experts warn Currently, just the lowest dose of Zepbound is readily available. Patients typically start at the lowest dose and work their way up to higher doses. The FDA anticipates limited availability through the end of the second financial quarter, meaning through at least June. An injection pen of Zepbound is displayed in New York City, December 11, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters Zepbound, has the same active ingredient -- tirzepatide -- as the drug Mounjaro, which is also manufactured by Eli Lilly and also in shortage for nearly all doses. Zepbound is specifically approved for weight loss for people with obesity, while Mounjaro is approved to manage blood sugar levels in those with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise. Eli Lilly told ABC News it had experienced \"unparalleled surge in demand\" for these drugs and the company is \"working with purpose and urgency to help meet the surge in demand.\" Meanwhile, only the highest dose of Wegovy is available with the remaining doses in short supply and the shortage duration \"to be determined,\" according to the FDA website. Last year, Novo Nordisk began limiting the supply of starter doses of Wegovy after demand began outpacing supply and manufacturing capacity. Additionally, the company paused some marketing of the drug last year \"to avoid stimulating further demand.\" Similarly to the relationship between Zepbound and Mounjaro, Wegovy has the same active ingredient, semaglutide, as Ozempic. However, Ozempic is not approved for weight loss -- only for diabetes -- and is not in shortage. MORE: Senators propose 'first step' to address US drug shortages by examining supply chains \"We are aware that another manufacturer has communicated supply shortages for its obesity medicine which may have implications for Wegovy demand,\" Novo Nordisk said in a statement to ABC News. \"Our focus has and will continue to be on patients and doing what we can to ensure that people who start treatment can stay on treatment. That's why we have been thoughtfully managing shipments of Wegovy for the past year while we worked to increase our production capacity. \"We will continue to follow our plan to gradually increase overall supply throughout the rest of the year, but it's important to recognize that overall demand will continue to exceed supply,\" the statement continued. \"This means that some patients may still have difficulty filling Wegovy prescriptions.\" All four medications -- Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro and Zepbound -- work by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1, which helps the body produce more insulin to lower blood sugar levels and slows digestion, all of which can help with weight loss. Mounjaro and Zepbound also work on a second hormone, GIP. If your pharmacy runs out of either Wegovy or Zepbound, experts recommend reaching out to neighboring pharmacies, telehealth pharmacies or even Amazon Pharmacy. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly partnered with Amazon Pharmacy to help with home delivery of Zepbound and Mounjaro. Experts also recommend speaking with your provider who prescribed the medications to discuss other possible options. The weight loss drug shortage comes amid an announcement from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and Utah Drug Information Service that drug shortages have reached an all-time high . During the first three months of 2024, there were 323 active medication shortages, the highest since the ASHP started tracking in 2001. Previously, the record high was 320 shortages in 2014.",

            "content": "Racial and ethnic disparities in health care are evident in every state, even those with robust health systems, according to a new analysis from the Commonwealth Fund . In the analysis from the organization, which is aimed at promoting equitable health care, researchers found health system performance is markedly worse for many people of color compared to white people. \"Even among high performing states, we see significant disparities,\" Joseph Betancourt, M.D., President of the Commonwealth Fund, said in a report on the organization\u2019s updated findings. Six states were found to have better-than-average health system performance among all racial or ethnic groups, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Hawaii, New Hampshire and New York. However, even among these high-scoring health systems, racial disparities were observed. \"This report demonstrates that if you don't look under the hood, you won't identify where you're failing people and where you're leaving people behind,\" Betancourt said.

Black, and American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people are more likely to die before age 75 from preventable and treatable causes, including, but not limited to, some infections such as appendicitis and certain cancers, than white populations, according to the analysis. There are also large disparities in health care access between white people and other racial or ethnic groups across all states. Despite coverage expansion by the Affordable Care Act in recent years, states' uninsured rates are generally higher and more variable for Black, Hispanic, and AIAN adults compared to Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) and white adults, according to the analysis. In particular, Hispanic people had the highest uninsured rates and cost-related difficulties in accessing care in almost all states. \"These groups have more problems accessing care and if quality of care is lower, then they have worse health outcomes compared to white people in many states,\" Senior Scientist David Radley, Ph.D., of the Commonwealth Fund, said in the report. The analysis, which was done using publicly available databases reporting outcomes from more than 328,000,000 people during the years 2021 and 2022, concluded that achieving health equity requires policy action and health system action, including: Ensuring affordable, comprehensive, and equitable health insurance coverage for all Strengthening primary care Improving health care quality and delivery Health systems and providers prioritizing and centering equity Investing in social services Improving the collection and analysis of racial and ethnic data to identify gaps Developing equity-focused measures to inform and evaluate policy Related Stories Trump cancels rally because of weather, proving the difficulty of balancing a trial and campaign Apr 20, 12:27 AM Vice President Harris announces final rules mandating minimum standards for nursing home staffing Apr 22, 5:02 AM A Nigerian chess champion plays the royal game for 60 hours \u2014 a new global chess record Apr 19, 7:43 AM \"Some of the major takeaways of this work is that we still have a lot of work to do,\" Senior Scholar and Commonwealth Fund Vice President Sara R.

It uses 25 data indicators to designate a \"State Health Equity Score,\" which indicates each state health system\u2019s performance based on health care access, quality, service use and health outcome. Scores were also determined for each of five racial or ethnic groups (Black, AIAN, AANHPI and Latinx/Hispanic) during the years 2021 and 2022, notably incorporating post-pandemic effects on health disparities.

During the first three months of 2024, there were 323 active medication shortages, according to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and Utah Drug Information Service. Previously, the record high was 320 shortages in 2014. This ASHP started tracking shortages in 2001. MORE: Patients, health care providers face shortages of critical drugs, Senate report finds \"All drug classes are vulnerable to shortage,\" Dr. Paul Abramowitz, CEO of ASHP, said in a statement. \"Some of the most worrying shortages involve generic sterile injectable medications, including cancer chemotherapy drugs and emergency medications stored in hospital crash carts and procedural areas.\" Last year, the American Cancer Society issued a warning that chemotherapy drugs had returned to the list of the top-five drug classes affected by shortages and warned this could have a devastating effect on patients. Some hospitals and clinics reported being completely out of the medications. Doctors have been forced to either ration cancer drugs or triage which patients receive the drugs first. A bottle of prescription medication is seen in an undated stock photo. STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images Additionally, Abramowitz said there are ongoing national shortages for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medications, which remain \"an issue for clinicians and patients.\" Among them is the ADHD prescription drug Adderall. The shortage began in late 2022 initially due to a delay from a manufacturer. As of early 2024, the shortage is now demand-driven, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \"The FDA can utilize different tools during a shortage to assist manufactures with increasing supply including expediting review of a supplement to add additional supply of active ingredients or adding additional capacity,\" an FDA official told ABC News in a statement earlier this year. \"Unfortunately, we are not able to share specific actions, as they are considered commercial confidential information. \" Shortages of some drugs have been an ongoing problem in the U.S. for more than a decade and were recently exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in March 2023. Lack of necessary medication means patients have to get delayed treatments, substitutions or sometimes no treatment at all, the report found. At a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee earlier this year, expert witnesses -- practitioners, researchers and pharmaceutical company executives -- said drug shortages can hurt patients financially because they may turn to alternate products that can cost more. MORE: Weight loss drugs including Zepbound, Wegovy in shortage, FDA says ASHP said it is working with the federal government to advise HHS agencies on their response to shortages and on steps the trade group believes the federal government could take to alleviate the shortage, including Congress requiring manufacturers to be more transparent about any supply chain issues and to encourage greater diversity in the supply chain. ASHP, however, said it had concerns about a proposal from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services that would issue financial penalties for hospitals that lack the resources to stockpile medications. \"Much work remains to be done at the federal level to fix the root causes of drug shortages,\" Abramowitz said. \"ASHP will continue to engage with policymakers regularly as we guide efforts to draft and pass new legislation to address drug shortages and continue to strongly advocate on behalf of our members for solutions that work.\" ABC News' Kristina Abovyan and Youri Benadjaoud contributed to this report.",

            "title": "Vice President Harris announces final rules mandating minimum standards for nursing home staffing",
            "date": "2024-04-22 05:02:00",
            "content": "The federal government is for the first time requiring nursing homes to have minimum staffing levels after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed grim realities in poorly staffed facilities for older and disabled Americans. Vice President Kamala Harris announced the final rules on Monday before a trip to La Crosse, Wisconsin, where she will talk to nursing home care employees about their work. In the battleground state, Harris also will hold a campaign event focused on abortion rights. President Joe Biden first announced his plan to set nursing home staffing levels in his 2022 State of the Union address, but his Democratic administration has taken longer to nail down a final rule as health care worker shortages plague the industry. Current law only requires that nursing homes have \u201csufficient\u201d staffing, leaving it up to states for interpretation. The new rules implement a minimum number of hours that staff members spend with residents. They also require a registered nurse to be available around the clock at the facilities, which are home to about 1.2 million people. The rules dictate that 80% of Medicaid payments for home care providers go to workers\u2019 wages. Allies of older adults have sought the regulation for decades, but the rules will most certainly draw pushback from the nursing home industry. The nursing home care event will mark Harris' third visit to the battleground state this year and is part of Biden's push to earn the support of union workers. Republican challenger Donald Trump made inroads with blue-collar workers in his 2016 victory. Biden regularly calls himself the \"most pro-union\u201d president in history and has received endorsements from leading labor groups such as the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Harris will gather nursing home care workers at an event Monday joined by Chiquita Brooks-Lasure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and April Verrett, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union. The coronavirus pandemic, which claimed more than 167,000 nursing home residents in the U.S., exposed the poor staffing levels at the facilities and led many workers to leave the industry. Advocates for the elderly and disabled reported residents who were neglected, going without meals and water or kept in soiled diapers for too long. Experts said staffing levels are the most important marker for quality of care. The new rules call for staffing equivalent to 3.48 hours per resident per day, just over half an hour of it coming from registered nurses. The government said that means a facility with 100 residents would need two or three registered nurses and 10 or 11 nurse aides as well as two additional nurse staff per shift to meet the new standards. The average U.S. nursing home already has overall caregiver staffing of about 3.6 hours per resident per day, including RN staffing just above the half-hour mark, but the government said a majority of the country\u2019s roughly 15,000 nursing homes would have to add staff under the new regulation. The new thresholds are still lower than those that had long been eyed by advocates after a landmark 2001 study funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, recommended an average of 4.1 hours of nursing care per resident daily. The government will allow the rules to be introduced in phases with longer timeframes for nursing homes in rural communities and temporary exemptions for places with workforce shortages. When the rules were first proposed last year, the American Health Care Association, which lobbies for care facilities, rejected the changes. The association\u2019s president, Mark Parkinson, a former governor of Kansas, called the rules \u201cunfathomable,\u201d saying he was hoping to convince the administration to never finalize the rule.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 02:51:00",
            "content": "BEIJING -- The Chinese government froze meaningful efforts to trace the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, despite publicly declaring it supported an open scientific inquiry, an Associated Press investigation has found. The AP drew on thousands of pages of undisclosed emails and documents, leaked recordings, and dozens of interviews that showed the freeze began far earlier than previously known \u2014 in the first weeks of the outbreak \u2014 and involved political and scientific infighting in China as much as international finger-pointing. Crucial initial efforts were hindered by bureaucrats in Wuhan trying to avoid blame who misled the central government; the central government, which silenced Chinese scientists and subjected visiting U.N. officials to stage-managed tours; and the World Health Organization itself, which may have compromised early opportunities to gather critical information, according to internal materials obtained by AP. Secrecy clouds the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Even the date when Chinese authorities first started searching for the virus\u2019 origins is unclear. The first publicly known search for the coronavirus took place on Dec. 31, 2019, when Chinese Center for Disease Control scientists visited the Wuhan market where many early COVID-19 cases surfaced. But WHO officials heard of an earlier inspection of the market on Dec. 25, 2019, according to a recording of a confidential WHO meeting provided to the AP. In the recording, WHO\u2019s top virus expert, Peter Ben Embarek, told colleagues that Chinese officials that day were \u201clooking at what was on sale in the market, whether all the vendors have licenses (and) if there was any illegal (wildlife) trade.\u201d Ben Embarek said the probe was \u201cnot routine\u201d and WHO would \u201ctry to figure out what happened.\u201d Such a probe has never been publicly mentioned by Chinese authorities or WHO. WHO said in an email that it was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any investigation on Dec. 25, 2019. Other experts said any visit to the market that day would be significant, especially if animal samples were taken because they could be critical evidence of how COVID-19 jumped to humans. Zhang Yongzhen was the first scientist to publish a sequence of the COVID-19 virus. One day after he wrote a memo urging health authorities to act quickly, China\u2019s top health official ordered his lab closed. \u201cThey used their official power against me and our colleagues,\u201d Zhang wrote in an email provided to AP by Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist. Among Chinese doctors and scientists, the sense grew that Beijing was hunting for a scapegoat. The government opened investigations into top health officials, according to two former and current China CDC staff and three others familiar with the matter. China CDC staff were encouraged to report colleagues who mishandled the outbreak to the Communist Party\u2019s disciplinary bodies, according to two of the people. As criticism of China grew, the Chinese government deflected blame. Instead of firing health officials, they declared their virus response a success and closed investigations into the officials with few job losses. \u201cThere were no real reforms, because doing reforms means admitting fault,\u201d said a public health expert in contact with top Chinese health officials who asked that he not be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Early on, Chinese scientists were silenced and politicians took control. As WHO negotiated with China for a mission to investigate COVID-19 in early 2020, it was China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, not scientists, that decided the terms. China refused a visa for WHO\u2019s Ben Embarek, then the agency\u2019s top animal virus expert. The itinerary dropped nearly all the items linked to an origins search, according to draft agendas obtained by AP. Taking charge of the WHO visit was Liang Wannian, an epidemiologist close to top Chinese officials who was widely seen as pushing the party line, not science-backed policies, according to nine people familiar with the situation who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Liang also ordered the Wuhan market disinfected before samples could be collected and promoted an implausible theory that COVID-19 originated from frozen food imported into China. On a train ride with Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Liang lobbied the U.N. agency to praise China\u2019s response in its public report. The new section was so flattering that colleagues emailed Aylward to suggest he \u201cdial it back a bit.\u201d By the time WHO led another visit to Wuhan in January 2021, the origins hunt had become highly politicized. Liang, the Chinese official in charge of two earlier WHO visits, organized market workers to tell WHO experts no live wildlife was sold and cut recent photos of wildlife at the market from the report. The WHO team concluded a lab leak was \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d But just months later, WHO chief Tedros said it was \u201cpremature\u201d to dismiss the lab leak theory and pressed China to be more transparent, infuriating Chinese officials China told WHO any future missions to find the origins of COVID-19 should be elsewhere, according to a letter obtained by AP. Since then, global cooperation has ground to a halt. Chinese scientists are still under heavy pressure, according to 10 researchers, medical experts and health officials. Researchers who published papers on the coronavirus ran into trouble with Chinese authorities. Others were barred from travel abroad for conferences and WHO meetings. The head of the China CDC Institute of Viral Disease was forced to retire over the release of sensitive market data, according to a former China CDC official who declined to be named, fearing repercussions. \u201cIt has to do with the origins, so they\u2019re still worried,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf you try and get to the bottom of it, what if it turns out to be from China?\u201d ___ Cheng reported from Geneva.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 02:36:00",
            "content": "BEIJING -- The hunt for the origins of COVID-19 has gone dark in China , the victim of political infighting after a series of stalled and thwarted attempts to find the source of the virus that killed millions and paralyzed the world for months. The Chinese government froze meaningful domestic and international efforts to trace the virus from the first weeks of the outbreak, despite statements supporting open scientific inquiry, an Associated Press investigation found. That pattern continues to this day, with labs closed, collaborations shattered, foreign scientists forced out and Chinese researchers barred from leaving the country. The investigation drew on thousands of pages of undisclosed emails and documents and dozens of interviews that showed the freeze began far earlier than previously known and involved political and scientific infighting in China as much as international finger-pointing. As early as Jan. 6, 2020, health officials in Beijing closed the lab of a Chinese scientist who sequenced the virus and barred researchers from working with him. Scientists warn the willful blindness over coronavirus \u2019 origins leaves the world vulnerable to another outbreak, potentially undermining pandemic treaty talks coordinated by the World Health Organization set to culminate in May. At the heart of the question is whether the virus jumped from an animal or came from a laboratory accident. A U.S. intelligence analysis says there is insufficient evidence to prove either theory, but the debate has further tainted relations between the U.S. and China. Unlike in the U.S., there is virtually no public debate in China about whether the virus came from nature or from a lab leak. In fact, there is little public discussion at all about the source of the disease, first detected in the central city of Wuhan. Crucial initial efforts were hampered by bureaucrats in Wuhan trying to avoid blame who misled the central government; the central government, which muzzled Chinese scientists and subjected visiting WHO officials to stage-managed tours; and the U.N. health agency itself, which may have compromised early opportunities to gather critical information in hopes that by placating China, scientists could gain more access, according to internal materials obtained by AP. In a faxed statement, China's Foreign Ministry defended China\u2019s handling of research into the origins, saying the country is open and transparent, shared data and research, and \u201cmade the greatest contribution to global origins research.\u201d The National Health Commission, China's top medical authority, said the country \u201cinvested huge manpower, material and financial resources\u201d and \u201chas not stopped looking for the origins of the coronavirus.\u201d It could have played out differently, as shown by the outbreak of SARS, a genetic relative of COVID-19, nearly 20 years ago. China initially hid infections then, but WHO complained swiftly and publicly. Ultimately, Beijing fired officials and made reforms. The U.N. agency soon found SARS likely jumped to humans from civet cats in southern China and international scientists later collaborated with their Chinese counterparts to pin down bats as SARS\u2019 natural reservoir. But different leaders of both China and WHO, China\u2019s quest for control of its researchers, and global tensions have all led to silence when it comes to searching for COVID-19\u2019s origins. Governments in Asia are pressuring scientists not to look for the virus for fear it could be traced inside their borders. Even without those complications, experts say identifying how outbreaks begin is incredibly challenging and that it\u2019s rare to know with certainty how some viruses begin spreading. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing how quickly the search for the origins of (COVID-19) escalated into politics,\u201d said Mark Woolhouse, a University of Edinburgh outbreak expert. \u201cNow this question may never be definitively answered.\u201d Secrecy clouds the beginning of the outbreak. Even the date when Chinese authorities first started searching for the origins is unclear. The first publicly known search for the virus took place on Dec. 31, 2019, when Chinese Center for Disease Control scientists visited the Wuhan market where many early COVID-19 cases surfaced. However, WHO officials heard of an earlier inspection of the market on Dec. 25, 2019, according to a recording of a confidential WHO meeting provided to AP by an attendee. Such a probe has never been mentioned publicly by either Chinese authorities or WHO. In the recording, WHO\u2019s top animal virus expert, Peter Ben Embarek, mentioned the earlier date, describing it as \u201can interesting detail.\u201d He told colleagues that officials were \u201clooking at what was on sale in the market, whether all the vendors have licenses (and) if there was any illegal (wildlife) trade happening in the market.\u201d A colleague asked Ben Embarek, who is no longer with WHO, if that seemed unusual. He responded that \u201cit was not routine,\u201d and that the Chinese \u201cmust have had some reason\u201d to investigate the market. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to figure out what happened and why they did that.\u201d Ben Embarek declined to comment. Another WHO staffer at the Geneva meeting in late January 2020 confirmed Ben Embarek\u2019s comments. The Associated Press could not confirm the search independently. It remains a mystery if it took place, what inspectors discovered, or whether they sampled live animals that might point to how COVID-19 emerged. A Dec. 25, 2019, inspection would have come when Wuhan authorities were aware of the mysterious disease. The day before, a local doctor sent a sample from an ill market vendor to get sequenced that turned out to contain COVID-19. Chatter about the unknown pneumonia was spreading in Wuhan\u2019s medical circles, according to one doctor and a relative of another who declined to be identified, fearing repercussions. A scientist in China when the outbreak occurred said they heard of a Dec. 25 inspection from collaborating virologists in the country. They declined to be named out of fear of retribution. WHO said in an email that it was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the Dec. 25 investigation. It is not included in the U.N. health agency\u2019s official COVID-19 timeline. When China CDC researchers from Beijing arrived on Jan. 1 to collect samples at the market, it had been ordered shut and was already being disinfected, destroying critical information about the virus. Gao Fu, then head of the China CDC, mentioned it to an American collaborator. \u201cHis complaint when I met him was that all the animals were gone,\u201d said Columbia University epidemiologist Ian Lipkin. Robert Garry, who studies viruses at Tulane University, said a Dec. 25 probe would be \u201chugely significant,\u201d given what is known about the virus and its spread. \u201cBeing able to swab it directly from the animal itself would be pretty convincing and nobody would be arguing\u201d about the origins of COVID-19, he said. But perhaps local officials simply feared for their jobs, with memories of firings after the 2003 SARS outbreak still vivid, said Ray Yip, the founding head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outpost in China. \u201cThey were trying to save their skin, hide the evidence,\u201d Yip said. The Wuhan government did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Another early victim was Zhang Yongzhen, the first scientist to publish a sequence of the virus. A day after he wrote a memo urging health authorities to action, China\u2019s top health official ordered Zhang\u2019s lab closed. \u201cThey used their official power against me and our colleagues,\u201d Zhang wrote in an email provided to AP by Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist. On Jan. 20, 2020, a WHO delegation arrived in Wuhan for a two-day mission. China did not approve a visit to the market, but they stopped by a China CDC lab to examine infection prevention and control\u202fprocedures, according to an internal WHO travel report. WHO\u2019s then-China representative, Dr. Gauden Galea, told colleagues in a private meeting that inquiries about COVID-19\u2019s origins went unanswered. By then, many Chinese were angry at their government. Among Chinese doctors and scientists, the sense grew that Beijing was hunting for someone to blame. \u201cThere are a few cadres who have performed poorly,\u201d Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in unusually harsh comments in February. \u201cSome dare not take responsibility, wait timidly for orders from above, and don\u2019t move without being pushed.\u201d The government opened investigations into top health officials, according to two former and current China CDC staff and three others familiar with the matter. Health officials were encouraged to report colleagues who mishandled the outbreak to Communist Party disciplinary bodies, according to two of the people. Some people both inside and outside China speculated about a laboratory leak. Those suspicious included right-wing American politicians, but also researchers close to WHO. The focus turned to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a high-level lab that experimented with some of the world\u2019s most dangerous viruses. In early February 2020, some of the West\u2019s leading scientists, headed by Dr. Jeremy Farrar, then at Britain\u2019s Wellcome Trust, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, then director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, banded together to assess the origins of the virus in calls, a Slack channel and emails. They drafted a paper suggesting a natural evolution, but even among themselves, they could not agree on the likeliest scenario. Some were alarmed by features they thought might indicate tinkering. \u201cThere have (been) suggestions that the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab,\u201d Holmes, the Australian virologist, who believed the virus originated in nature, wrote in a Feb. 7, 2020, email. \u201cI do a lot of work in China, and I can (assure) you that a lot of people there believe they are being lied to.\u201d American scientists close to researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology warned counterparts there to prepare. James LeDuc, head of a Texas lab, emailed his Wuhan colleague on Feb. 9, 2020, saying he\u2019d already been approached by U.S. officials. \u201cClearly addressing this will be essential, with any kind of documentation you might have,\u201d he wrote. The Chinese government was conducting its own secret investigation into the Wuhan Institute. Gao, the then-head of the China CDC, and another Chinese health expert revealed its existence in interviews months and years later. Both said the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing, which Holmes, the Australian virologist, also heard from another contact in China. But Gao said even he hadn't seen further details, and some experts suspect they may never be released. WHO started negotiations with China for a further visit with the virus origins in mind, but it was China\u2019s Foreign Ministry that decided the terms. Scientists were sidelined and politicians took control. China refused a visa for Ben Embarek, then WHO\u2019s top animal virus expert. The itinerary dropped nearly all items linked to an origins search, according to draft agendas for the trip obtained by the AP. And Gao, the then-head of the China CDC who is also a respected scientist tasked with investigating the origins, was left off the schedule. Instead, Liang Wannian, a politician in the Communist Party hierarchy, took charge of the international delegation. Liang is an epidemiologist close to top Chinese officials and China's Foreign Ministry who is widely seen as pushing the party line, not science-backed policies, according to nine people familiar with the situation who declined to be identified to speak on a sensitive subject. Liang ruled in favor of shutting the Wuhan market at the beginning of the outbreak, according to a Chinese media interview with a top China CDC official that was later deleted. Significantly, it was Liang who promoted an implausible theory that the virus came from contaminated frozen food imported into China. Liang did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Most of the WHO delegation was not allowed to go to Wuhan, which was under lockdown. The few who did learned little. They again had no access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology or the wildlife market and obtained only scant details about China CDC efforts to trace the coronavirus there. On the train, Liang lobbied the visiting WHO scientists to praise China\u2019s health response in their public report. Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saw it as the \u201cbest way to meet China\u2019s need for a strong assessment of its response.\u201d The new section was so flattering that colleagues emailed Aylward to suggest he \u201cdial it back a bit.\u201d \u201cIt is remarkable how much knowledge about a new virus has been gained in such a short time,\u201d read the final report, which was reviewed by China\u2019s top health official before it went to Tedros. As criticism of China grew, the Chinese government deflected blame. Instead of firing health officials, they declared their virus response a success and closed investigations into the officials with few job losses. \u201cThere were no real reforms, because doing reforms means admitting fault,\u201d said a public health expert in contact with Chinese health officials who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. In late February 2020, the internationally respected doctor Zhong Nanshan appeared at a news conference and said that \u201cthe epidemic first appeared in China, but it did not necessarily originate in China.\u201d Days later, Chinese leader Xi ordered new controls on virus research. A leaked directive from China\u2019s Publicity Department ordered media not to report on the virus origins without permission, and a public WeChat account reposted an essay claiming the U.S. military created COVID-19 at a Fort Detrick lab and spread it to China during a 2019 athletic competition in Wuhan. Days later, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson repeated the accusation. The false claims enraged U.S. President Donald Trump, who began publicly blaming China for the outbreak, calling COVID-19 \u201cthe China virus\u201d and the \u201ckung-flu.\u201d Chinese officials told WHO that blood tests on lab workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were negative, suggesting they hadn\u2019t been previously infected with bat coronaviruses. But when WHO pressed for an independent audit, Chinese officials balked and demanded WHO investigate the U.S. and other countries as well. By blaming the U.S., Beijing diverted blame. It was effective in China, where many Chinese were upset by racially charged criticism. But outside China, it fueled speculation of a lab leak coverup. By the time WHO led another visit to Wuhan in January 2021, a year into the pandemic, the atmosphere was toxic. Liang, the Chinese health official in charge of two earlier WHO visits, continued to promote the questionable theory that the virus was shipped into China on frozen food. He suppressed information suggesting it could have come from animals at the Wuhan market, organizing market workers to tell WHO experts no live wildlife was sold and cutting recent photos of wildlife at the market from the final report. There was heavy political scrutiny, with numerous Chinese officials who weren\u2019t scientists or health officers present at meetings. Despite a lack of direct access, the WHO team concluded that a lab leak was \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d So it came as an infuriating surprise to Chinese officials when, months later, WHO chief Tedros said that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to rule out the lab leak theory, saying such lab accidents were \u201ccommon,\u201d and pressed China to be more transparent. China told WHO any future missions to find COVID-19 origins should be elsewhere, according to a letter obtained by AP. Since then, global cooperation on the issue has ground to a halt; an independent group convened by WHO to investigate the origins of COVID-19 in 2021 has been stymied by the lack of cooperation from China and other issues. Chinese scientists are still under heavy pressure, according to 10 researchers and health\u202fofficials. Researchers who published papers on the coronavirus ran into trouble with Chinese authorities. Others were barred from travel abroad for conferences and WHO meetings. Gao, the then-director of the China CDC, was investigated after U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a review of COVID-19 data, and again after giving interviews on the virus origins. New evidence is treated with suspicion. In March 2023, scientists announced that genetic material collected from the market showed raccoon dog DNA mixed with COVID-19 in early 2020, data that WHO said should have been publicly shared years before. The findings were posted, then removed by Chinese researchers with little explanation. The head of the China CDC Institute of Viral Disease was forced to retire over the release of the market data, according to a former China CDC official who declined to be named to speak on a sensitive topic. \u201cIt has to do with the origins, so they\u2019re still worried,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIf you try and get to the bottom of it, what if it turns out to be from China?\u201d Other scientists note that any animal from which the virus may have originally jumped has long since disappeared. \u201cThere was a chance for China to cooperate with WHO and do some animal sampling studies that might have answered the question,\u201d said Tulane University\u2019s Garry. \u201cThe trail to find the source has now gone cold.\u201d ___ Cheng reported from Geneva.",

            "content": "CHEROKEE, N.C. -- Medical marijuana can now be legally purchased in North Carolina with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians opening its long-planned dispensary this weekend on tribal land. Hundreds of people, many with approved medical patient cards to purchase items, celebrated the historic opening of the Great Smoky Cannabis Co. on Saturday within the Eastern Band land known as the Qualla Boundary, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported. Saturday was April 20, which is also known as \u201c420 Day,\u201d or an annual day for the celebration of marijuana. The ceremony marks the latest liberalization of marijuana rules by the tribe, which in 2021 decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana within its 89 square miles (231 square kilometers) of land in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The tribe also formed a medical marijuana system that included a tribe-created business to grow cannabis and sell it, reaping financial rewards for the tribal members and assisting those with medical conditions. \u201cThis project will change the trajectory of their lives forever,\u201d Forrest Parker, general manager for Qualla Enterprises, the tribal company that manages the dispensary, said during the opening ceremony. \u201cIt will be a conduit to generations of social, economic and spiritual growth, unlike anything that\u2019s ever been witnessed.\u201d The Eastern Band, with about 14,000 members, can pass rules permitting cannabis as a sovereign nation and federally recognized tribe. Marijuana use remains illegal in the rest of North Carolina. Still, Republican U.S. Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd have raised concerns with federal and state law enforcement about whether drug laws will continue to be carried out in light of the dispensary. A statewide medical marijuana bill has been considered in recent years by the North Carolina General Assembly. Adults at least 21 years of age with a tribe medical cannabis patient card or an out-of-state approved medical marijuana card can purchase items at Great Smoky Cannabis Co. The scope of marijuana sales could become much greater. A majority of Eastern Band voters backed in a referendum last September the adult, recreational use of marijuana on tribal land. The question also asked whether voters supported the tribal council to develop legislation to regulate such a market. The Charlotte Observer reported that an adult use ordinance could be finalized in June, citing council member Boyd Owle. \u201cLet\u2019s get it right before we put it out there. But we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d Owle said after a council work session on the ordinance earlier this month. The dispensary could generate over $200 million in gross sales revenues in its first year if limited to medical patients, compared with $385 million if the product is available to all adult users, according to figures from Qualla Enterprises released before last year\u2019s adult-use referendum. Saturday\u2019s ceremony featured tribal translator Myrtle Driver Johnson purchasing the first medical marijuana in a transaction made in English and Cherokee. She said that she had named and translated the different strains of cannabis into Cherokee.",

            "title": "Biden sees a $35 price cap for insulin as a pivotal campaign issue. It\u2019s not that clear-cut",
            "date": "2024-04-21 07:41:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- Rarely a day goes without President Joe Biden mentioning insulin prices. He promotes a $35 price cap for the medication for Americans on Medicare \u2014 in White House speeches, campaign stops and even at non-health care events around the country. His reelection team has flooded swing-state airwaves with ads mentioning it, in English and Spanish. All that would seemingly add up to a sweeping political and economic impact. The reality is more complicated. As his campaign tries to emphasize what it sees as an advantage over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, Biden often overstates what those people who are eligible for the price cap once paid for insulin. It\u2019s also not clear whether the number of Americans being helped will be enough to help sway November\u2019s election , even in the most closely contested states that could come down to a few thousand votes. \u201cIt is about political signaling in a campaign much more than it is about demonstrating for people that they benefit from the insulin cap,\u201d said Drew Altman, president and CEO of KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. \u201cIt is a way to make concrete the fact that you are the health care candidate.\u201d Many who are benefiting from the price cap were already getting insulin at reduced prices, were already Biden supporters, or both. Others who need reduced-price insulin, meanwhile, cannot get it because they do not have Medicare or private health insurance . Biden\u2019s campaign is emphasizing the president's successful efforts to reduce insulin prices and contrasting that with Trump, who first ran for president promising to lower drug prices but took limited action in office. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful and tangible contrast,\u201d said Biden campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one we are campaigning on early, aggressively, and across our coalition.\u201d Roughly 8.4 million people in the United States control their blood sugar levels with insulin, and more than 1 million have Type 1 diabetes and could die without regular access to it. The White House says nearly 4 million older people qualify for the new, lower price. The price cap for Medicare recipients was part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which originally sought to cap insulin at $35 for all those with health insurance. When it passed in 2022, it was scaled back by congressional Republicans to apply only to older adults. The Biden administration has also announced agreements with drugmakers Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, to cap insulin co-payments at $35 for those with private insurance. They account for more than 90% of the U.S. insulin market. But Biden says constantly that many people used to pay up to $400 monthly, which is an overstatement. A Department of Health and Human Services study released in December 2022 found that people with diabetes who were enrolled in Medicare or had private insurance paid an average of $452 annually, not monthly. The high prices the president cites mostly affected people without health insurance. But the rates of the uninsured have fallen to record lows because of the Obama administration\u2019s signature health care law and the Biden White House\u2019s aggressive efforts to ensure those eligible to enroll are doing so more frequently. So, in effect, one of the administration\u2019s policy initiatives is undermining the economic argument for another. That effort has not reached everyone, though. Yanet Martinez who lives in Phoenix and supports Biden. She does not work or have health insurance, but gets insulin for around $16 per month thanks to steep discounts at her local clinic. The lower prices only apply if her husband, a landscaper, does not make enough to exceed the monthly income limit. If he does, her insulin can jump to $500-plus, she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people talk about the price of insulin going down. I\u2019ve not seen it,\u201d said Martinez, 42. \u201cIt should be uniform. There are a lot of people who don\u2019t have any way to afford it and it makes things very difficult.\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., is sponsoring bipartisan legislation to make the $35 insulin cap universal, even for people without health insurance. In the meantime, he said, what's been accomplished with Medicare recipients and drugmakers agreeing to reduce their prices is \"literally saving lives and saving people money.\u201d \u201cThis is good policy because it centers the people rather than the politics,\" Warnock said. He said that as he travels Georgia, a pivotal swing state in November, people say \u201cthank you for doing this for me, or for someone in my family.\u201d That includes people like Tommy Marshall, a 56-year-old financial services consultant in Atlanta, who has health insurance. He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 45 and injects fast-acting insulin several times daily. He paid about $250 for four weeks to eight weeks worth of medication last November, but saw the price fall by half in February, after Novo Nordisk agreed to cut prices. \u201cIf I was his political consultant, I\u2019d be telling (Biden) to talk about it constantly,\" said Marshall, a lifelong Democrat and longtime public advocate for cutting insulin prices, including for the advocacy group Protect Our Care Georgia. Marshall said the price caps \u201chave meaningful emotional resonance\u201d and could sway a close election but also conceded, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 18- to 65-year-olds. I can just imagine there\u2019s probably two or three other issues that are in front of this one.\u201d \u201cMaybe someone sort of on-the-fence, he added \u201cthis could maybe sway them.\u201d Geoff Garin, a pollster for Biden's reelection campaign, said the insulin cap is one of the president's highest performing issues. He said the data was \u201cclear, consistent and overwhelming.\u201d Rich Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which has endorsed Biden, called the insulin cap a strong issue for the president among older voters. \u201cFor the persuadables \u2014 and there are some still out there, believe it or not \u2014 drug costs are a very important factor,\u201d said Fiesta, whose group has 4.4-million members and advocates for health and economic security for older people. Trump's campaign did not respond to questions. But Theo Merkel, senior fellow at the conservative Paragon Health Institute, countered that the insulin price cut an example of \"policies written to fit the talking points other than the other way around.\u201d Merkel, who was a Trump White House adviser on health policy, said manufacturers that have long made insulin prefer caps on how much the insured pay because it gives them more leverage to secure higher prices from insurance companies. The president's approval ratings on health care are among his highest on a range of issues, but still only 42% of U.S. adults approve of Biden\u2019s handling of health care while 55% disapprove, according to a February poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. KFF found in its own poll in December that that 59% of U.S. adults trust the Democratic Party to do a better job addressing health care affordability issues compared to 39% for Republicans, even if only 26% of respondents in the same poll said they knew about the insulin price cap. \u201cIn political terms, the Democrats and Biden have an advantage on health care,\" Altman said. \u201cThey're pressing it.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-20 09:04:00",
            "content": "Pregnant employees have the right to a wide range of accommodations under new federal regulations for enforcing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that supporters say could change workplace culture for millions of people. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency in charge of enforcing the law, adopted an expansive view of conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth in its proposed regulations, including a controversial decision to include abortion, fertility treatment and birth control as medical issues requiring job protections. The rules, which were adopted on a 3-2 vote along partisan lines, were published Monday and offer extensive guidelines for addressing more routine difficulties of pregnancy, such as morning sickness, back pain and needing to avoid heavy lifting. Labor advocates say the law will be especially transformative for pregnant women in low-wage jobs, who are often denied simple requests like more bathroom breaks. Here's what to know about the law and the EEOC regulations. Congress passed the law with bipartisan support in December 2022 following a decade-long campaign by women's rights and labor advocates, who argued that the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act did little to guarantee women would receive the accommodations they might need at work. The law stated only that pregnant workers should be treated the same as other employees, not that they deserved special consideration. To get their requests met, many pregnant workers therefore needed to demonstrate they had physical limitations covered under the Americans With Disabilities Act, often creating insurmountable hurdles. The new law treats pregnancy and related conditions as themselves deserving of \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d and places the burden on employers to prove \u201cundue hardships\u201d for denying any requests. The law applies to employers of at least 15 workers. The EEOC estimates it will cover roughly 1.5 million pregnant workers in any given year. The EEOC regulations published April 15 are set to go into effect in June. The EEOC's 400-page document encompasses a wide array of conditions and relevant advice for employers. It states that workers are entitled to unpaid time off for situations such as prenatal appointments, fertility treatments, abortion, miscarriage, postpartum depression and mastitis, an infection that arises from breastfeeding. This includes workers who are not covered by federal family leave laws and those who have not been on the job long enough to accrue time off. Workers can ask for flexible working arrangements to deal with morning sickness, such as a later start time, clearance to work from home or permission to carry snacks in workplaces where eating is typically prohibited. If they can't sit or stand for extended periods due to sciatica, which is common in late pregnancy, they can request a schedule adjustment so their commutes happen during less crowded hours. The regulations also allow workers to be exempted from tasks such as climbing ladders or heavy lifting. If those duties are essential to their jobs, they can still request a temporary dispensation, according to the EEOC. Employers don\u2019t have to accommodate workers exactly as requested but they must offer reasonable alternatives. They cannot deny a request without clearing a high bar to prove doing so would cause \u201cundue hardships\u201d for the organization\u2019s finances or operations. They cannot force workers to take unpaid leave if a reasonable accommodation is available. The EEOC emphasizes that it \u201cshould not be complicated or difficult\u201d for pregnant workers to request accommodations. Workers don't have to make requests in writing, use specific words, cite any laws, or in most cases, provide documentation such as doctors' notes. Employers must respond quickly and have a conversation about how to reasonably accommodate a worker\u2019s needs. Still, legal experts advise both workers and employers to document the process. A Better Balance, the non-profit that spearheaded the 10-year campaign for the law's passage, advises workers to familiarize themselves with their legal rights and be as specific as possible about their limitations and the changes they they need. Workers who believe a request was denied illegally can file a complaint with the EEOC. They have 180 days to do so, though the deadline can be extended in some states. The EEOC included abortion among the conditions covered under the law. The rules state, however, that employers are not obligated to cover expenses related to the procedure or to offer health insurance that does. The EEOC regulations argue that including abortion is consistent with the agency's longstanding interpretation of other laws under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. But the decision drew condemnation from Republican lawmakers who had championed the law's passage. The five-member EEOC's two Republican members voted against the regulations. In a statement explaining her dissent, Commissioner Andrea Lucas said the agency broadened the scope of the law \u201cto reach virtually every condition, circumstance, or procedure that relates to any aspect of the female reproductive system\" in ways that \"cannot reasonably be reconciled with the text\" of the law. Melissa Losch, a labor and employment attorney at the New Orleans-based firm McGlinchey Stafford, said she expects the regulations to give rise to further litigation. Losch cited the example of a worker living in a state with a restrictive abortion law requesting time off to undergo the procedure in another state. The EEOC rules provide \u201cno good answer\u201d about whether granting such a request would conflict with restrictive state abortion laws, she added. On February 27, a federal judge blocked enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act for Texas state employees, a ruling that came in response to a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxton argued the law was unconstitutional because it was part of a spending bill that passed in the House without a majority of members present, and the judge ruled in his favor. Gedmark, of A Better Balance, said she was optimistic the Biden administration would prevail in its expected appeal of the ruling. In the meantime, federal and private sectors workers in Texas are covered by the law. But in her dissenting statement, Lucas warned that if the Texas case or any future lawsuits succeed in overturning the law, the EEOC's divisive rules have \u201call but extinguished\u201d the chances of a bipartisan effort to reenact it. Employers have been obligated to abide by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act since it took effect on June 27, 2023, though the EEOC regulations provided guidance on how to do so. The law swiftly made a difference to many low-wage workers, according to Gedmark. A Better Balance, which operates a helpline, has \u201cheard an overwhelmingly positive experience from workers,\u201d she said. Last summer, the organization worked with some women whose employers stopped resisting requests for accommodations as soon as the law took effect, Gedmark said. Some workers reported their employers were still operating under the old legal framework, handing them pages of disability paperwork to fill out in response to requests. The EEOC said it received almost 200 complaints alleging violations of the law by the time the fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, 2023. Gedmark said the success of the law will depend on enforcement and raising awareness. \u201cIf workers don\u2019t know about the law and don\u2019t know about their rights, then it really undermines the purpose of the law,\u201d she said. ____ The Associated Press\u2019 women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

            "date": "2024-04-19 18:27:00",
            "content": "BOISE, Idaho -- A new Idaho organization says it will ask voters to restore abortion access and other reproductive health care rights in the state after lawmakers let a second legislative session end without modifying strict abortion bans that have been blamed for a recent exodus of health care providers. \u201cWe have not been able to get a fix from our lawmakers, our politicians. We are going to seek a fix from our people,\u201d Melanie Folwell, a spokeswoman for Idahoans United for Women and Families, said Friday morning. \u201cThe people in Idaho understand the contours of this problem.\u201d Idaho has several anti-abortion laws on the books, including one that makes performing abortions a crime even in medical emergencies unless they are done to save the life of the pregnant patient. The federal government has sued Idaho over the ban, contending it violates a federal law that requires hospitals to provide stabilizing care \u2014 including abortion \u2014 if a patient's life or health is at serious risk. Idaho's attorneys say the ban allows for life-saving procedures for things like ectopic pregnancies, and they contend the Biden administration is trying to create a federal \u201cabortion loophole\u201d at Idaho hospitals. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in that case on Wednesday. Idahoans United for Women and Families is fundraising and hopes to have one or more ballot initiatives ready to propose this summer in an effort to get them on the 2026 ballot, Folwell said. Across the country, there have been increased efforts to put abortion rights questions to voters since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and removed the nationwide right to abortion. Voters in seven states have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures, and several other states have signature drives for future ballot initiatives underway. Cynthia Dalsing, a certified nurse midwife in northern Idaho and a board member for Idahoans United for Women and Families, said her region went from offering a \u201cpremiere obstetric range of services\u201d to becoming a maternal care desert after the four local obstetricians moved out of state. Pregnant women in the state's panhandle now must either travel as much as 80 miles away or leave the state entirely for obstetric care, Dalsing said. Some are delivering babies at home because of a lack of other options, she said. Roughly one-quarter of Idaho obstetricians have stopped practicing since a near-total abortion ban took effect in August 2022, along with about half of the state's maternal fetal medicine doctors, according to data compiled by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative. Three hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units. Some physicians and businesses are warning that the abortion bans carry other ripple effects as well. During a news conference on Thursday, Dr. Jim Souza said the reduced access to prenatal health care means some dangerous pregnancy conditions will be diagnosed later than normal. Souza, the chief physician executive at the Boise-based St. Luke's Health System, said that could lead to increased need for intensive medical treatment for newborns or expensive medical interventions for mothers that could have been avoided with better access to obstetric care. A coalition of groups including the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, Levi Strauss & Co., Yelp, Lyft and Match Group Inc. which runs dating apps like Tinder filed a friend-of-the court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court case contending that the abortion bans make it harder to recruit and retain workers and lead to increased time off of work for those who have to travel elsewhere for care.",

            "title": "Kansas has a new anti-DEI law, but the governor has vetoed bills on abortion and even police dogs",
            "date": "2024-04-19 17:47:00",
            "content": "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas' Democratic governor on Friday vetoed proposed tax breaks for anti-abortion counseling centers while allowing restrictions on college diversity initiatives approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature to become law without her signature. Gov. Laura Kelly also vetoed a bill with bipartisan support to increase the penalties for killing a law enforcement dog or horse, a move that the GOP leader who pushed it called \u201cpolitical pettiness.\u201d In addition, she rejected two election s measures fueled at least in part by the influence of people promoting baseless election conspiracies among Republicans. Kelly's action on the bill dealing with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives stood out because it broke with her vetoes last year of anti-DEI measure from the current state budget. The new law, taking effect July 1, prohibits state universities, community colleges and technical schools from requiring prospective students or applicants for jobs or promotions to make statements on their views about diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Kelly let it become law only two days after the state's higher education board adopted its own, narrower ban on the same practices. \u201cWhile I have concerns about this legislation, I don\u2019t believe that the conduct targeted in this legislation occurs in our universities,\" Kelly said in her message on the bill, contradicting statements made by GOP legislators. Legislators are scheduled to return Thursday from a spring break and wrap up their work for the year in six days. Top Republicans immediately pledged to try to override Friday\u2019s vetoes. Republicans in about two dozen states have sought to limit DEI initiatives, arguing that they are discriminatory and enforce a liberal political orthodoxy. Alabama and Utah enacted new anti-DEI laws this year, and a ban enacted in Texas last year has led to more than 100 job cuts on University of Texas campuses. The new policy from the Kansas Board of Regents applies only to state universities and does not specify any penalties, while the new law will allow a fine of up to $10,000 for each violation. Backers of DEI programs say they are being misrepresented. The American Psychological Association defines diversity, equity and inclusion as a framework to guide \u201cfair treatment and full participation of all people,\u201d especially those in minority groups. \u201cWe need to move forward and focus our efforts on making college more affordable and providing students from all backgrounds with the tools they need to succeed,\u201d Kelly said in her message on the bill. With the bill helping the state's nearly 60 anti-abortion centers, Kelly's veto was expected because she is a strong supporter of abortion rights. She already has vetoed two other measures championed by abortion opponents this year. But GOP lawmakers in Kansas have had increasing success in overriding Kelly\u2019s actions. Republican leaders appear to have the two-thirds majorities necessary in both chambers on abortion issues and appeared close on the DEI bill. The latest abortion measure would exempt anti-abortion centers that provide free services to prospective mothers and new parents from paying the state's 6.5% sales tax on what they buy and give donors to them income tax credits totaling up to $10 million a year. Kelly said in her veto message that it is not appropriate for the state to \u201cdivert taxpayer dollars to largely unregulated crisis pregnancy centers.\u201d The bill also includes provisions designed to financially help parents who adopt or want to adopt children. \u201cGovernor Kelly has shown once again that her only allegiance is to the profit-driven abortion industry, and not to vulnerable Kansas women, children, and families,\u201d Jeanne Gawdun, a lobbyist for Kansans for Life, the state's most influential anti-abortion group, said in a statement. Abortion opponents in Kansas are blocked from pursuing the same kind of severe restrictions or bans on abortion imposed in neighboring states, including Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. A Kansas Supreme Court decision in 2019 declared that access to abortion is a fundamental right under the state constitution, and a statewide vote in August 2022 decisively affirmed that position. \u201cThis bill goes against the wishes of Kansans,\u201d Kelly said in her veto message. Kelly also has clashed repeatedly with Republicans on voting rights issues. One of the election bills she vetoed would stop giving voters an extra three days after Election Day to return mail ballots to election officials. Many Republicans said they are responding to constituents' concerns that accepting ballots after Election Day compromises the integrity of election results \u2014 though they are fueled by lies from ex-President Donald Trump. The other elections bill would prohibit state agencies and local officials from using federal funds in administering elections or promoting voting without the Legislature's express permission. Republicans see spending by the Biden administration as an attempt to improperly boost Democratic turnout. But Kelly chided lawmakers for \u201cfocusing on problems that do not exist.\" \u201cI would urge the Legislature to focus on real issues impacting Kansans,\u201d Kelly said in her veto message on the second bill. The veto of the bill on police dogs was perhaps Kelly's most surprising action. Increased penalties have had bipartisan support across the U.S., and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis this week signed a measure this week. The Kansas measure was inspired by the November death of Bane, an 8-year-old Wichita police dog, who authorities say was strangled by a suspect in a domestic violence case. It would allow a first-time offender to be sentenced to up to five years and fined up to $10,000. Kelly said the issue needed more study, saying the new penalties for killing a police dog would be out of line with other, more severe crimes, \u201cwithout justification.\" But House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican and the bill's biggest champion, said: \u201cThis veto is a slap in the face of all law enforcement.\u201d",

            "title": "Popular weight loss drugs in tight supply as Zepbound shortage could last through June",
            "date": "2024-04-19 15:55:00",
            "content": "Shortages of popular weight loss medications are continuing amid an all-time high of drug scarcity in the United States. Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk, and Zepbound, made by Eli Lilly & Co., are in tight supply and may be hard to obtain for the next several months, according to the pharmaceutical companies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its drug shortage database on Wednesday to reflect that most doses of Zepbound have limited availability due to \"demand increase for the drug.\" MORE: Drug shortage can put patients' lives at risk, experts warn Currently, just the lowest dose of Zepbound is readily available. Patients typically start at the lowest dose and work their way up to higher doses. The FDA anticipates limited availability through the end of the second financial quarter, meaning through at least June. An injection pen of Zepbound is displayed in New York City, December 11, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters Zepbound, has the same active ingredient -- tirzepatide -- as the drug Mounjaro, which is also manufactured by Eli Lilly and also in shortage for nearly all doses. Zepbound is specifically approved for weight loss for people with obesity, while Mounjaro is approved to manage blood sugar levels in those with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise. Eli Lilly told ABC News it had experienced \"unparalleled surge in demand\" for these drugs and the company is \"working with purpose and urgency to help meet the surge in demand.\" Meanwhile, only the highest dose of Wegovy is available with the remaining doses in short supply and the shortage duration \"to be determined,\" according to the FDA website. Last year, Novo Nordisk began limiting the supply of starter doses of Wegovy after demand began outpacing supply and manufacturing capacity. Additionally, the company paused some marketing of the drug last year \"to avoid stimulating further demand.\" Similarly to the relationship between Zepbound and Mounjaro, Wegovy has the same active ingredient, semaglutide, as Ozempic. However, Ozempic is not approved for weight loss -- only for diabetes -- and is not in shortage. MORE: Senators propose 'first step' to address US drug shortages by examining supply chains \"We are aware that another manufacturer has communicated supply shortages for its obesity medicine which may have implications for Wegovy demand,\" Novo Nordisk said in a statement to ABC News. \"Our focus has and will continue to be on patients and doing what we can to ensure that people who start treatment can stay on treatment. That's why we have been thoughtfully managing shipments of Wegovy for the past year while we worked to increase our production capacity. \"We will continue to follow our plan to gradually increase overall supply throughout the rest of the year, but it's important to recognize that overall demand will continue to exceed supply,\" the statement continued. \"This means that some patients may still have difficulty filling Wegovy prescriptions.\" All four medications -- Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro and Zepbound -- work by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1, which helps the body produce more insulin to lower blood sugar levels and slows digestion, all of which can help with weight loss. Mounjaro and Zepbound also work on a second hormone, GIP. If your pharmacy runs out of either Wegovy or Zepbound, experts recommend reaching out to neighboring pharmacies, telehealth pharmacies or even Amazon Pharmacy. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly partnered with Amazon Pharmacy to help with home delivery of Zepbound and Mounjaro. Experts also recommend speaking with your provider who prescribed the medications to discuss other possible options. The weight loss drug shortage comes amid an announcement from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and Utah Drug Information Service that drug shortages have reached an all-time high . During the first three months of 2024, there were 323 active medication shortages, the highest since the ASHP started tracking in 2001. Previously, the record high was 320 shortages in 2014.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 13:46:00",
            "content": "A convicted rapist was charged with murder and attempted sexual assault Friday in the killing of a visiting nurse at a Connecticut halfway house for sex offenders in October \u2014 a crime that spurred calls for better safety measures for home health care workers. Authorities added the charges against Michael Reese, 39, as he appeared in state court in Danielson for a related larceny and drug paraphernalia case. Police arrested him on those allegations as he was leaving the Willimantic halfway house on the day when Joyce Grayson was found dead in the basement on Oct. 28. Officers said Reese had some of Grayson's possessions on him. Grayson, a 63-year-old mother of six and a nurse for 36 years, had gone to the house to administer medication to Reese. Police responded there when someone reported she had missed later appointments. Reese was charged with murder, felony murder and attempted first-degree sexual assault, according to the court clerk's office. Additional details of the allegations were not immediately available. Reese's public defender did not immediately return phone and emails messages seeking comment Friday. Grayson's family was relieved that the murder charge was filed, said their lawyer, Kelly Reardon. \u201cThey would like to thank the police for gathering the evidence needed to, hopefully, ensure that Michael Reese is convicted of this horrific and senseless crime,\u201d Reardon said in a statement. New details of the killing emerged Friday with the release of the arrest warrant for Reese. Grayson was strangled and was found naked from the waist down, except for her socks, according to the warrant. She also had blunt-force injuries to her head, torso and extremities, the warrant said, citing an autopsy by the chief medical examiner's office. Testing also showed that DNA found on Grayson's body was highly likely Reese's DNA, the warrant said. Grayson's daughter called police to request a well-being check after Grayson missed some appointments after Reese, the warrant said. The daughter said she used a phone location app and it said Grayson was at the address of the halfway house, according to the document. Police also said the Department of Correction recorded phone calls Reese made while detained on the larceny and drug paraphernalia charges that appear to implicate him in the killing. \u201cBasically, bro, it was a robbery gone wrong, bro. A robbery gone accident, that's it,\u201d Reese said on one of the calls, according to the warrant. In another phone conversation, Reese said he had started using drugs again and it led him to do \u201cwhat happened,\" the warrant said. He also said that he would take a plea bargain, according to the document. \u201cI'm going to take the first offer that they give me as long as the charges are right,\u201d he said, according to the warrant. \u201cI don't care, like, I'm, I've already come to terms that this is it for me.\u201d Grayson was a nurse for the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services for 26 years before serving as a visiting nurse for over a decade, according to her family. She also was a beloved foster parent, taking in nearly three dozen children and being honored with the state\u2019s Foster Parent of the Year award in 2017. After her death, state and federal lawmakers renewed pushes to prevent violence against health care workers. Reese, who was on probation after serving more than 14 years in prison for stabbing and sexually assaulting a woman in 2006 in New Haven, was taken into police custody while leaving the halfway house on the day Grayson was killed. He was released from prison in late 2020 and was sent back to detention two times for violating probation, state records show. Authorities said he had some of Grayson\u2019s belongings, including credit cards, and was charged with violating probation, larceny and using drug paraphernalia. The warrant said he drove Grayson's car to a bank and a local convenience store and used Grayson's debit card to withdraw more than $400 before returning to the house and getting arrested. Police said surveillance video showed Reese at the bank and store, and his GPS monitoring device for his probation showed him near those locations at the same times. A judge on Friday set bail at $2 million on the new charges. Reese has been detained on bail since his arrest. He is due back in court on June 7. Reardon said Grayson's family, who believe her death was preventable, will soon be filing a lawsuit. She declined to name the defendants, but has said the family is seeking answers to an array of questions including if there were failures of oversight of Reese by the state, including probation officials, and the company that runs the halfway house. The state Judicial Branch, which oversees probation, says it does not comment on cases involving possible litigation. The family also wants to know whether Grayson's employer, Elara Caring, adequately protected her. Elara's chairman and chief executive, Scott Powers, has said company workers were shocked and saddened over Grayson's death, and the company was reviewing existing safety protocols.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 09:26:00",
            "content": "PARIS -- French athletes at the Paris Olympics will be offered better protection for their mental health, with priority given to curbing online harassment and cyberbullying. France\u2019s Sports Minister Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra and Secretary of State for Digital Affairs Marina Ferrari have been discussing ways to ensure mental health is looked after at the July 26-Aug. 11 Paris Games and Aug 28-Sept. 8 Paralympics. Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra pointed out the continued threat of cyberbullying to mental health in society in general, a risk she says is magnified when high-profile athletes are continually in the spotlight. \u201cAthletes as well as many of our citizens are exposed to these risks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are implementing the tools to help our athletes, but also our young and all French people.\u201d A study carried out by France \u2019s National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and Performance (INSEP) showed that 15% of athletes have shown signs of high anxiety or depression, with the first signs of psychological difficulties beginning on average at the age of 17. The risk factors themselves are already well-known. They include being away from family for sustained periods of time, pressure from fans, expectations from sponsors, reactions from angry gamblers losing bets, fear of failure and constant pressure to get results. These factors are magnified by constant exposure on social networks. So plans are in place to better protect mental health going forward. Starting from June, the website France.sport dedicated to top-level athletes will have a \u201cSant\u00e9 Mentale\u201d (Mental Health) section, which athletes can click onto. It features a guide with practical advice and a self-evaluation questionnaire. The athlete also has access to a psychologist recommended by INSEP. The same services will continue after the Games, and are also available for coaching staff. INSEP will also work with other French sports organizations on a presentation to raise awareness on risks linked to mental health among athletes. France's sports minister is working with other ministries on ways to develop and support the profession of Mental Coach \u2014 someone who works closely with athletes to help with their mental preparation in order to improve their performance. At the Olympic Village in the suburb of Saint-Denis, a safeguarding officer from the French Olympic and Paralympic delegation and three welfare officers (who are trained psychologists) will be onsite during the Games. They will offer assistance to athletes and staff members who are experiencing mental health difficulties and, if needed, they can be mobilized to support athletes who are staying outside of the main Village. The safeguarding officer on site is also dovetailing as a designated person of trust who alerts social network platforms in case of serious problems happening online. An online application called Bodyguard is already being used by the French Tennis Federation and the French soccer league to give athletes better online protection, including content arriving in their private messages if they so wish. \u201cThe psychological stability of athletes deserves all of our attention. More than ever, they should feel safe and should be supported when they go through moments of difficulty or doubt or have a need to express themselves,\u201d Ferrari said. \u201cThe context of (athletes') lives exposes them to increased risks. They should be cared for with regards to these risks.\u201d Further discussions are scheduled to be held in the coming weeks with the main social network platforms. ___ AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

            "date": "2024-04-19 04:29:00",
            "content": "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Desperate to end a weeks-long strike by thousands of doctors, South Korea\u2019s government said Friday it will slow down a plan to admit more students to the country's medical schools from next year. More than 90% of the country\u2019s 13,000 medical interns and residents have been on strike since late February, when the government announced a plan to recruit 2,000 more students next year. That would have increased the current cap of 3,058, which has been the same since 2006, by about two-thirds. The government adopted a compromise proposal put forward by the presidents of six state-run universities on Thursday, under which medical schools will increase admissions over several years. Doctors\u2019 groups have claimed that the universities would be unable to handle a steep increase in students and that it would undermine the quality of the country\u2019s medical services. Government officials say the country significantly needs more doctors to cope with the country\u2019s fast-aging population. Announcing the compromise proposal, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo cited concerns that the prolonged strike by junior doctors is increasing the strain on hospitals. Han said the country\u2019s 32 medical schools will be allowed to lower their quotas for new places by up to 50% of the target set by the government in 2025, meaning the number of new places could end up closer to 1,000 than 2,000. Officials stressed that the compromise is temporary and that the schools will be required to finalize plans by April to increase their admissions by the full 2,000 by 2026. Doctors' groups have called for the government to scrap the plan entirely. \u201cThe government decided that the damage caused by the vacuums in healthcare services cannot be left unchecked and that bold decisions are needed, considering the demands by patients and broader public to solve the problem,\u201d Han said in a news conference, urging the striking doctors to return to work and negotiate with the government.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 01:23:00",
            "content": "SEATTLE -- Saturday marks marijuana culture\u2019s high holiday, 4/20, when college students gather \u2014 at 4:20 p.m. \u2014 in clouds of smoke on campus quads and pot shops in legal-weed states thank their customers with discounts. This year\u2019s edition provides an occasion for activists to reflect on how far their movement has come, with recreational pot now allowed in nearly half the states and the nation\u2019s capital. Many states have instituted \u201csocial equity\u201d measures to help communities of color, harmed the most by the drug war, reap financial benefits from legalization. And the White House has shown an openness to marijuana reform. Here\u2019s a look at 4/20's history: The origins of the date, and the term \u201c420\u201d generally, were long murky. Some claimed it referred to a police code for marijuana possession or that it derived from Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cRainy Day Women No. 12 & 35,\u201d with its refrain of \u201cEverybody must get stoned\u201d \u2014 420 being the product of 12 times 35. But the prevailing explanation is that it started in the 1970s with a group of bell-bottomed buddies from San Rafael High School, in California's Marin County north of San Francisco, who called themselves \u201cthe Waldos.\u201d A friend\u2019s brother was afraid of getting busted for a patch of cannabis he was growing in the woods at nearby Point Reyes, so he drew a map and gave the teens permission to harvest the crop, the story goes. During fall 1971, at 4:20 p.m., just after classes and football practice, the group would meet up at the school\u2019s statue of chemist Louis Pasteur, smoke a joint and head out to search for the weed patch. They never did find it, but their private lexicon \u2014 \u201c420 Louie\u201d and later just \u201c420\u201d \u2014 would take on a life of its own. The Waldos saved postmarked letters and other artifacts from the 1970s referencing \u201c420,\u201d which they now keep in a bank vault, and when the Oxford English Dictionary added the term in 2017, it cited some of those documents as the earliest recorded uses. A brother of one of the Waldos was a close friend of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh, as Lesh once confirmed in an interview with the Huffington Post, now HuffPost. The Waldos began hanging out in the band\u2019s circle and the slang spread. Fast-forward to the early 1990s: Steve Bloom, a reporter for the cannabis magazine High Times, was at a Dead show when he was handed a flyer urging people to \u201cmeet at 4:20 on 4/20 for 420-ing in Marin County at the Bolinas Ridge sunset spot on Mt. Tamalpais.\u201d High Times published it. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon,\u201d one of the Waldos, Steve Capper, now 69, once told The Associated Press. \u201cMost things die within a couple years, but this just goes on and on. It\u2019s not like someday somebody\u2019s going to say, \u2018OK, Cannabis New Year\u2019s is on June 23rd now.\u2019\u201d While the Waldos came up with the term, the people who made the flier distributed at the Dead show \u2014 and effectively turned 4/20 into a holiday \u2014 remain unknown. With weed, naturally. Some celebrations are bigger than others: The Mile High 420 Festival in Denver, for example, typically draws thousands and describes itself as the largest free 4/20 event in the world. Hippie Hill in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park has also attracted massive crowds, but the gathering was canceled this year, with organizers citing a lack of financial sponsorship and city budget cuts. College quads and statehouse lawns are also known for drawing 4/20 celebrations, with the University of Colorado Boulder historically among the largest, though not so much since administrators banned the annual smokeout over a decade ago. Some breweries make beers that are 420-themed, but not laced, including SweetWater Brewing in Atlanta, which is throwing a 420 music festival this weekend and whose founders went to the University of Colorado. Lagunitas Brewing in Petaluma, California, releases its \u201cWaldos\u2019 Special Ale\u201d every year on 4/20 in partnership with the term\u2019s coiners. That's where the Waldos will be this Saturday to sample the beer, for which they picked out \u201chops that smell and taste like the dankest marijuana,\u201d one Waldo, Dave Reddix, said via email. 4/20 has also become a big industry event, with vendors gathering to try each other's wares. The number of states allowing recreational marijuana has grown to 24 after recent legalization campaigns succeeded in Ohio, Minnesota and Delaware. Fourteen more states allow it for medical purposes, including Kentucky, where medical marijuana legislation that passed last year will take effect in 2025. Additional states permit only products with low THC, marijuana's main psychoactive ingredient, for certain medical conditions. But marijuana is still illegal under federal law. It is listed with drugs such as heroin under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, meaning it has no federally accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. The Biden administration, however, has taken some steps toward marijuana reform. The president has pardoned thousands of people who were convicted of \u201csimple possession\u201d on federal land and in the District of Columbia. The Department of Health and Human Services last year recommended to the Drug Enforcement Administration that marijuana be reclassified as Schedule III, which would affirm its medical use under federal law. According to a Gallup poll last fall, 70% of adults support legalization, the highest level yet recorded by the polling firm and more than double the roughly 30% who backed it in 2000. Vivian McPeak, who helped found Seattle's Hempfest more than three decades ago, reflected on the extent to which the marijuana industry has evolved during his lifetime. \u201cIt's surreal to drive by stores that are selling cannabis,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people laughed at us, saying, \u2018This will never happen.\u2019\u201d McPeak described 4/20 these days as a \u201cmixed bag.\u201d Despite the legalization movement's progress, many smaller growers are struggling to compete against large producers, he said, and many Americans are still behind bars for weed convictions. \u201cWe can celebrate the victories that we've had, and we can also strategize and organize to further the cause,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the kind of complacency that some people might feel, we still got work to do. We've got to keep burning that shoe leather until we get everybody out of jails and prisons.\u201d For the Waldos, 4/20 signifies above all else a good time. \u201cWe\u2019re not political. We\u2019re jokesters,\u201d Capper has said. \u201cBut there was a time that we can\u2019t forget, when it was secret, furtive. ... The energy of the time was more charged, more exciting in a certain way. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s all good \u2014 it\u2019s not good they were putting people in jail,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to go back there.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Claire Rush contributed from Portland, Oregon.",

            "title": "BNSF Railway says it didn't know about asbestos that's killed hundreds in Montana town",
            "date": "2024-04-19 01:05:00",
            "content": "HELENA, Mont. -- BNSF Railway attorneys told a Montana jury Friday that the railroad should not be held liable for the lung cancer deaths of two former residents of an asbestos-contaminated Montana town, one of the deadliest sites in the federal Superfund pollution program. Attorneys for the company say the corporate predecessors of the railroad, owned by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, didn't know the vermiculite they hauled over decades from a nearby mine was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers or that asbestos was dangerous. BNSF attorney Chad Knight said the railroad could only be held liable if it could have foreseen the health hazards of asbestos based on information available decades ago when the alleged exposures happened. \u201cIn the 50s, 60s and 70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,\u201d Knight said. The case in federal civil court is the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby, Montana. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable for its alleged role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. The seven-member jury met briefly Friday and planned to resume deliberations on Monday morning. They were instructed to decide if the railroad was at fault in the deaths and if so, the amount of damages to award to their estates. If the jurors find that the railroad should also face punitive damages, a separate hearing would determine that amount. Looming over the proceedings is W.R. Grace & Co., a chemical company that operated a mountaintop vermiculite mine 7 miles (11 kilometers) outside of Libby until it was closed 1990. The Maryland-based company played a central role in Libby's tragedy and has paid significant settlements to victims. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris has referred to the the chemical company as \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d in the BNSF trial. He reminded jurors several times that the case was about the railroad's conduct, not W.R. Grace's separate liability. How much W.R. Grace revealed about the asbestos dangers to Texas-based BNSF and its corporate predecessors has been sharply disputed. The plaintiffs argued that railroad higher-ups were aware, but that workers on the ground in Libby were left out of the loop. \u201cWe're here to make a party that accepts zero responsibility accept an appropriate amount of responsibility,\u201d plaintiffs' attorney Mark Lanier said. \u201cThis is the fault of the bigwigs in the corporate office.\u201d The judge instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes. It said W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. Former railroad workers said during testimony and in depositions that they knew nothing about the risks of asbestos. They said Grace employees were responsible for loading the hopper cars, plugging the holes of any cars leaking vermiculite and occasionally cleaned up material that spilled in the rail yard. The estates of the two deceased plaintiffs have argued that the W.R. Grace\u2019s actions don\u2019t absolve BNSF of its responsibility for failing to clean up the vermiculite that spilled in the railyard in the heart of the community. Their attorneys said BNSF should have known about the dangers because Grace put signs on rail cars carrying vermiculite warning of potential health risks. They showed jurors an image of a warning label allegedly attached to rail cars in the late 1970s that advised against inhaling the asbestos dust because it could cause bodily harm. Family members of Tom Wells and Joyce Walder testified that their lives ended soon after they were diagnosed with mesothelioma. The families said the dust blowing from the rail yard sickened and killed them. In a March 2020 video of Wells played for jurors and recorded the day before he died, he lay in a home hospital bed, struggling to breathe. \u201cI\u2019ve been placed in a horrible spot here, and the best chance I see at release \u2014 relief for everybody \u2014 is to just get it over with,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something I want to try and play hero through because I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a miracle waiting.\u201d The Environmental Protection Agency descended on Libby after the 1999 news reports. In 2009 it declared in Libby the nation\u2019s first ever public health emergency under the federal Superfund cleanup program. The pollution in Libby has been cleaned up, largely at public expense. Yet the long timeframe over which asbestos-related diseases develop means people previously exposed are likely to continue getting sick for years to come, health officials say. ___ Brown reported from Billings, Montana.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 00:12:00",
            "content": "RAMAT GAN, Israel -- When Ben Binyamin was left for dead, his right leg blown off during the Hamas attack on the Tribe of Nova music festival, the Israeli professional soccer player thought he would never again play the game he loved. \u201cWhen I woke up,\u201d the 29-year-old said, \u201cI felt I was going to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair.\u201d Then Binyamin learned about a chance to be \u201cnormal\u201d again: Israel's national amputee soccer team. The team, which includes two Israeli soldiers who lost limbs fighting in the war with Hamas, has offered all three a chance to heal from life-altering wounds suffered during the Oct. 7 attacks and Israel\u2019s ensuing war in Gaza. It heads to France in June for the European Amputee Football Championships. Some 16 teams, mostly from Europe, will compete. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing in my life,\u201d said 1st Sgt. Omer Glikstal of the team's twice-weekly practices at a stadium in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The 20-year-old soldier from Haifa regularly played soccer until his life was turned upside-down when a rocket-propelled grenade shattered his left foot during a battle in Gaza in November. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different game than I used to play, but in the end, it\u2019s the same,\u201d he said. Dozens of Israelis lost limbs during the Hamas attacks that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and the war that followed. Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, home to a major rehabilitation center, says it alone has treated about 60 amputees. Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry says 1,573 soldiers have been wounded since Israel began its ground offensive in late October, in which troops have engaged in close combat with Hamas militants. The military did not have specific statistics on amputees but said some 320 soldiers were critically wounded. The Israeli athletes and others who lost limbs have benefited from a world-class medical system that has decades of experience treating young people injured in wars and conflict. In Gaza, unknown numbers of Palestinians have also lost limbs in a war that has claimed nearly 34,000 lives, according to Gaza health officials. Gaza\u2019s health system has been overwhelmed by the war, and doctors and patients say they often need to choose between amputation or death. Before the war, Gaza also had a fledgling team of amputee soccer players wounded in previous conflicts with Israel. Shaked Bitton, an Israeli army division commander, lost his right leg when he was shot by a Hamas sniper with a .50-caliber round \u2014 the type that can blast through concrete \u2014 near the Jabaliya refugee camp in late October. \u201cI heard two shots. I fell down. I looked back,\u201d the 21-year-old soldier said, \u201cand I saw my leg.\u201d Bitton thought his life was over \u2014 he had never even met an amputee before \u2014 until he was visited in the hospital by others who had lost limbs and successfully resumed their lives. Among them was Zach Shichrur, founder of Israel's national amputee soccer team. Severely injured when a bus ran over his foot at age 8, he knew what these men were going through, and he offered them hope. \u201cThere is nothing greater than to go out and compete at the international level when you have the Israeli flag on your chest. Most of us, if not all, could not have even imagined something like this,\u201d said Shichrur, 36, an attorney and the team's captain. Since its founding five years ago, the Israeli team has met with growing success, placing third in the Nations League in Belgium in October. That qualified it to compete in the European championship in June. Amputee soccer teams have six fielder players who are missing lower limbs; they play on crutches and without prosthetics. Each team has a goalkeeper with a missing upper extremity. The pitch is smaller than standard. At team practices, the Israeli players are undeterred by the absence of an arm or a leg \u2014 whether from an accident, a war injury or a birth defect. \u201cWe all have something in common. We\u2019ve been through a lot of hard and difficult times. It unites us,\u201d said Aviran Ohana, a cybersecurity expert whose right leg is shorter than his left due to a birth defect, and who has played with the team for two years. On a recent April evening, the team started its warm-up with sprints around the pitch, the men speeding forward propelled by one leg, steadied by their crutches. A game against able-bodied teenagers followed. Binyamin, dripping with sweat, kicked the ball with his left leg as the coach shouted from the sidelines: \u201cForward! Forward!\u201d Every goal was celebrated. Sir Ludwig Guttmann, a Jewish neurologist who fled Nazi Germany in 1939 and settled in Britain, is credited with pioneering competitive sports as a form of rehabilitation. Guttmann, who organized the first competition for wheelchair athletes on the opening day of the 1948 London Olympic Games, is considered the father of the Paralympic Games, and his legacy has enhanced the lives of thousands of handicapped athletes. In Israel today, the amputee soccer team offers the players the excitement of competition \u2014 and the healing powers of sport, said Michal Nechama, the team\u2019s physical therapist. \u201cThey need it for their soul,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives them joy, pride. That extra thing that you can\u2019t give in a hospital.\u201d",

            "title": "Emergency rooms refused to treat pregnant women, leaving one to miscarry in a lobby restroom",
            "date": "2024-04-19 00:01:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- One woman miscarried in the lobby restroom of a Texas emergency room as front desk staff refused to check her in. Another woman learned that her fetus had no heartbeat at a Florida hospital, the day after a security guard turned her away from the facility. And in North Carolina, a woman gave birth in a car after an emergency room couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died. Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, federal documents obtained by The Associated Press reveal. The cases raise alarms about the state of emergency pregnancy care in the U.S., especially in states that enacted strict abortion laws and sparked confusion around the treatment doctors can provide. \u201cIt is shocking, it\u2019s absolutely shocking,\u201d said Amelia Huntsberger, an OB/GYN in Oregon. \u201cIt is appalling that someone would show up to an emergency room and not receive care -- this is inconceivable.\u201d It's happened despite federal mandates that the women be treated. Federal law requires emergency rooms to treat or stabilize patients who are in active labor and provide a medical transfer to another hospital if they don\u2019t have the staff or resources to treat them. Medical facilities must comply with the law if they accept Medicare funding. The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday that could weaken those protections. The Biden administration has sued Idaho over its abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, arguing it conflicts with the federal law. \u201cNo woman should be denied the care she needs,\u201d Jennifer Klein, director of the White House Gender Policy Council, said in a statement. \u201cAll patients, including women who are experiencing pregnancy-related emergencies, should have access to emergency medical care required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).\u201d Pregnant patients have \u201cbecome radioactive to emergency departments\u201d in states with extreme abortion restrictions, said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor. \u201cThey are so scared of a pregnant patient, that the emergency medicine staff won\u2019t even look. They just want these people gone,\" Rosenbaum said. Consider what happened to a woman who was nine months pregnant and having contractions when she arrived at the Falls Community Hospital in Marlin, Texas, in July 2022, a week after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on abortion. The doctor on duty refused to see her. \u201cThe physician came to the triage desk and told the patient that we did not have obstetric services or capabilities,\u201d hospital staff told federal investigators during interviews, according to documents. \u201cThe nursing staff informed the physician that we could test her for the presence of amniotic fluid. However, the physician adamantly recommended the patient drive to a Waco hospital.\u201d Investigators with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services concluded Falls Community Hospital broke the law. Reached by phone, an administrator at the hospital declined to comment on the incident. The investigation was one of dozens the AP obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request filed in February 2023 that sought all pregnancy-related EMTALA complaints the previous year. One year after submitting the request, the federal government agreed to release only some complaints and investigative documents filed across just 19 states. The names of patients, doctors and medical staff were redacted from the documents. Federal investigators looked into just over a dozen pregnancy-related complaints in those states during the months leading up to the U.S. Supreme Court's pivotal ruling on abortion in 2022. But more than two dozen complaints about emergency pregnancy care were lodged in the months after the decision was unveiled. It is not known how many complaints were filed last year as the records request only asked for 2022 complaints and the information is not publicly available otherwise. The documents did not detail what happened to the patient turned away from the Falls Community Hospital. Other pregnancies ended in catastrophe, the documents show. At Sacred Heart Emergency Center in Houston, front desk staff refused to check in one woman after her husband asked for help delivering her baby that September. She miscarried in a restroom toilet in the emergency room lobby while her husband called 911 for help. \u201cShe is bleeding a lot and had a miscarriage,\u201d the husband told first responders in his call, which was transcribed from Spanish in federal documents. \u201cI\u2019m here at the hospital but they told us they can\u2019t help us because we are not their client.\u201d Emergency crews, who arrived 20 minutes later and transferred the woman to a hospital, appeared confused over the staff's refusal to help the woman, according to 911 call transcripts. One first responder told federal investigators that when a Sacred Heart Emergency Center staffer was asked about the gestational age of the fetus, the staffer replied: \u201cNo, we can\u2019t tell you, she is not our patient. That\u2019s why you are here.\u201d A manager for Sacred Heart Emergency Center declined to comment. The facility is licensed in Texas as a freestanding emergency room, which means it is not physically connected to a hospital. State law requires those facilities to treat or stabilize patients, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services agency said in an email to AP. Sacred Heart Emergency\u2019s website says that it no longer accepts Medicare, a change that was made sometime after the woman miscarried, according to publicly available archives of the center's website. Meanwhile, the staff at Person Memorial Hospital in Roxboro, North Carolina, told a pregnant woman, who was complaining of stomach pain, that they would not be able to provide her with an ultrasound. The staff failed to tell her how risky it could be for her to depart without being stabilized, according to federal investigators. While en route to another hospital 45 minutes away, the woman gave birth in a car to a baby who did not survive. Person Memorial Hospital self-reported the incident. A spokeswoman said the hospital continues to \u201cprovide ongoing education for our staff and providers to ensure compliance.\u201d In Melbourne, Florida, a security guard at Holmes Regional Medical Center refused to let a pregnant woman into the triage area because she had brought a child with her. When the patient came back the next day, medical staff were unable to locate a fetal heartbeat. The center declined to comment on the case. Emergency rooms are subject to hefty fines when they turn away patients, fail to stabilize them or transfer them to another hospital for treatment. Violations can also put hospitals' Medicare funding at risk. But it\u2019s unclear what fines might be imposed on more than a dozen hospitals that the Biden administration says failed to properly treat pregnant patients in 2022. It can take years for fines to be levied in these cases. The Health and Human Services agency, which enforces the law, declined to share if the hospitals have been referred to the agency's Office of Inspector General for penalties. For Huntsberger, the OB-GYN, EMTALA was one of the few ways she felt protected to treat pregnant patients in Idaho, despite the state's abortion ban. She left Idaho last year to practice in Oregon because of the ban. The threat of fines or loss of Medicare funding for violating EMTALA is a big deterrent that keeps hospitals from dumping patients, she said. Many couldn't keep their doors open if they lost Medicare funding. She has been waiting to see how HHS penalizes two hospitals in Missouri and Kansas that HHS announced last year it was investigating after a pregnant woman, who was in preterm labor at 17 weeks, was denied an abortion. \u201cA lot of these situations are not reported, but even the ones that are \u2014 like the cases out of the Midwest \u2014 they're investigated but nothing really comes of it,\u201d Huntsberger said. \u201cPeople are just going to keep providing substandard care or not providing care. The only way that changes is things like this.\u201d President Joe Biden and top U.S. health official Xavier Becerra have both publicly vowed vigilance in enforcing the law. Even as states have enacted strict abortion laws, the White House has argued that if hospitals receive Medicare funds they must provide stabilizing care, including abortions. In a statement to the AP, Becerra called it the \u201cnation's bedrock law protecting Americans' right to life- and health-saving emergency medical care.\u201d \u201cAnd doctors, not politicians, should determine what constitutes emergency care,\" he added. Idaho\u2019s law allows abortion only if the life, not the health, of the mother is at risk. But the state's attorney general has argued that its abortion ban is \u201cconsistent\u201d with federal law, which calls for emergency rooms to protect an unborn child in medical emergencies. \"The Biden administration has no business rewriting federal law to override Idaho\u2019s law and force doctors to perform abortions,\u201d Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador said in a statement earlier this year. Now, the Supreme Court will weigh in. The case could have implications in other states like Arizona, which is reinstating an 1864 law that bans all abortions, with an exception only if the mother's life is at risk. EMTALA was initially introduced decades ago because private hospitals would dump patients on county or state hospitals, often because they didn\u2019t have insurance, said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas of the American Civil Liberties Union. Some hospitals also refused to see pregnant women when they did not have an established relationship with physicians on staff. If the court nullifies or weakens those protections, it could result in more hospitals turning away patients without fear of penalty from the federal government, she said. \u201cThe government knows there\u2019s a problem and is investigating and is doing something about that,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas said. \u201cWithout EMTALA, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-18 20:54:00",
            "content": "RENO, Nev. -- Nevada's Supreme Court upheld a state ban on ghost guns Thursday, overturning a lower court's ruling that sided with a gun manufacturer's argument that the 2021 law regulating firearm components with no serial numbers was too broad and unconstitutionally vague. Separately the court handed a setback to anti-abortion activists in a fight over a voter initiative that no longer was headed to the November ballot anyway, a decision that abortion rights' advocates say nonetheless helps establish important legal guidelines regarding overall reproductive health care . The gun law had previously been struck down by Lyon County District Judge John Schlegelmilch, who ruled in favor of a legal challenge by Nevada-based gun manufacturer Polymer80 Inc. that said the statute was too vague. Among other things, Polymer80 argued, terms such as \u201cblank,\u201d \u201ccasting,\u201d and \u201cmachined body\u201d were not defined, while \u201cunfinished frame or receiver\u201d failed to specify what a \u201cfinished\u201d frame or receiver is. In upholding the statute, the Supreme Court said in a unanimous decision that the language that lawmakers approved and then-Gov. Steve Sisolak signed was \u201creadily\u201d understandable through ordinary usage and common understanding. \u201cThe statutes here only regulate conduct involving an object that is intended to ultimately become a firearm,\u201d Chief Justice Lydia Stiglich wrote in the ruling. \u201cThey prohibit acts involving such not-yet-complete firearms that have not been imprinted with a serial number. \u201d She noted in the ruling that Polymer80's \u201cown legal counsel had written letters to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that included the words \u2018blank,\u2019 \u2018casting,\u2019 and \u2018machined\u2019 in reference to its own products, showing that these terms are commonly understood.\u201d The fact that the terms were \u201cgeneric and broad\u201d does not make them vague, Stiglich added. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat who filed the appeal on the state's behalf in December 2021, said the ruling \u201cis a win for public safety and creates sensible, practical measures to protect Nevadans from violent crime.\u201d \u201cThe ban on \u2018ghost guns\u2019 is one of the most impactful pieces of legislation that we have seen come through Carson City,\u201d he said in a statement. Polymer80's legal counsel did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment. In the other decision Thursday, the high court rejected a Carson City judge's ruling that the initiative's description was misleading and violated requirements that it address a single subject by including abortion rights under the umbrella of reproductive health care. \u201cThe medical procedures considered in the initiative petition concern reproduction. To assert that they could not all be addressed together because they are separate procedures is improper,\u201d the Supreme Court said. \u201cEach medical procedure relates to human reproduction and they are germane to each other and the initiative\u2019s single subject of establishing a right to reproductive freedom.\u201d Abortion rights advocates hailed the decision even though they have already shifted their focus to a different and narrower initiative, which seeks to amend the state constitution and which they are are confident will make the November ballot after a judge ruled that it had met legal muster. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is an unequivocal recognition of what we\u2019ve always know to be true: The right to reproductive freedom includes all aspects of a person\u2019s reproductive health care,\u201d Lindsey Harmon, president of Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, said in a statement. A lawyer representing a group that was fighting the voter initiative, the Coalition for Parents and Children, said expressed disappointment. \u201cThe Court has transformed the single-subject rule into the single-category rule, which will open the floodgates to broad and deceptive initiative proposals like the one at issue in this case,\u201d Jason Guinasso said via email. \u201cMy clients will now focus on educating the voters on why this proposal is bad law and policy for Nevadans.\u201d Harmon said her group has gathered more than 160,000 signatures for the new ballot initiative \u2014 well above the 102,000 required by June 26 \u2014 and intends to submit them for validation that month. The measure would enshrine in the constitution current protections under a 1990 law that guarantee access to abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy, or later to protect the health of the pregnant person. Voters would need to approve it in both 2024 and 2026 to change the constitution.",

            "date": "2024-04-18 18:22:00",
            "content": "DOVER, Del. -- A bill allowing doctor-assisted suicide in Delaware narrowly cleared the Democrat-led House on Thursday and now goes to the state Senate for consideration. The bill is the latest iteration of legislation that has been repeatedly introduced by Newark Democrat Paul Baumbach since 2015, and it is the only proposal to make it to a floor vote. After lengthy debate, lawmakers voted 21-16 for the measure, which needed at least 21 affirmative votes for passage. Among those voting for the bill was Republican Rep. Kevin Hensley of Townsend, who voted against the proposal in previous legislative sessions. \u201cI did not get confused,\u201d Hensley assured fellow lawmakers after the vote. Hensley said his perspective on the issue changed after his mother, who lived in California, opted for physician-assisted suicide a year ago. \u201cThis was probably one of the toughest votes I\u2019ve ever had to make,\u201d said Hensley, the only GOP lawmaker to vote for the bill. California is one of 10 states, along with the District of Columbia, that have laws legalizing medically assisted suicide. Several Republican lawmakers expressed ethical concerns about the Delaware legislation. They also questioned the need for it, given advances in hospice and palliative care in recent years. Baumbach said the measure is not intended to replace palliative or hospice care, but to complement them. Data from other states indicate that hospice care is involved in the vast majority of cases involving doctor-assisted suicide, he added. Baumbach said the \u201cend-of-life option\u201d offered in the bill gives terminally ill individuals certainty that they can choose to end their pain if it becomes greater than what hospice or palliative care can alleviate. \u201cThis puts the choice in the dying person\u2019s hands to determine whether or not they wish to self-administer the medicine,\u201d he said. The legislation allows an adult resident of Delaware who is diagnosed with a terminal illness and expected to die within six months to request lethal prescription drugs from a doctor or advanced practice registered nurse who has primary responsibility for the terminal illness. A consulting physician or nurse would have to confirm the diagnosis and prognosis of the patient, who must have \u201cdecision-making capacity.\u201d The patient would have to be evaluated by a psychiatrist or a psychologist if any of the medical professionals involved is concerned that he or she lacks decision-making capacity. A person also would not qualify for doctor-assisted suicide solely because of age or disability. The patient would have to make two oral requests for a lethal prescription, followed by a written request, and would have to wait at least 15 days after the initial request before receiving the drugs. The attending doctor or nurse would have to wait at least 48 hours after the written request, which must be signed by two witnesses, before prescribing the drugs. The bill states that any provision in a contract, will or other agreement that would affect whether an individual could make or rescind a request for lethal prescription \u201cis not valid.\u201d It also states that requesting, prescribing or dispensing the lethal medication \u201cdoes not, for any purpose, constitute elder abuse, suicide, assisted-suicide, homicide, or euthanasia.\u201d The legislation goes further to assert that the act of killing oneself with self-administered prescription medication does not invalidate any part of an insurance policy or annuity.",

            "date": "2024-04-18 18:06:00",
            "content": "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky will use a lottery system to award an initial round of licenses to businesses competing to participate in the state's startup medical cannabis program, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Thursday. The governor called it a fair way to give each applicant that clears the screening process an opportunity to land a license for the program, which launches statewide at the start of 2025. The lottery, set for October, should remove any temptation to lobby in an effort to \u201cget a leg up in different ways that we don\u2019t want to see,\u201d Beshear said at his weekly news conference. \u201cIt reduces or eliminates litigation, and it creates a more fair process, not one where people bid against each other and only then the big companies can be a part of it,\u201d the governor said. \u201cBut one that provides at least a chance for everyone who can meet the criteria.\u201d The state initially will issue 48 medical cannabis dispensary licenses, divided among 11 regions. The goal is to ensure the shortest possible drive times for Kentuckians with qualifying health conditions, said Sam Flynn, executive director of the medical cannabis program. Each region will be allocated at least four dispensary licenses, and counties will be limited to one dispensary with the exception of those that are home to Louisville and Lexington, which can have two licenses, Flynn said. Limited numbers of cultivator and processor licenses will be issued. Caps on licenses are meant to avoid flooding the market with medicinal cannabis products and exceed demand, which would hurt businesses and patients, the governor said. \u201cYou can see this is not about having a dispensary on every corner,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cIt is a limited program that we can monitor and fulfill the promise we made of doing this safely, but also having access in each region for people that do qualify.\u201d The program can be expanded with more businesses in the future depending on demand and whether more qualifying medical conditions are added. \u201cThis is likely the minimum that you will see on the program moving forward,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cBut again, you can always scale up. Scaling back hurts businesses, hurts people and hurts access.\u201d \"We don\u2019t start huge. We start with a manageable program that, yes, can grow,\u201d he added. On Wednesday the Democratic governor signed legislation moving up the timeline for licensing cannabis businesses by six months, with the window for applications running from July 1 through the end of August. The change makes it likely that at least limited supplies will be available in January when they become legal, Beshear said. Medical marijuana supporters overcame years of setbacks in Kentucky when lawmakers passed the measure last year legalizing medical cannabis for people suffering from a range of debilitating illnesses, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, epilepsy, chronic nausea and post-traumatic stress disorder. The governor has advocated for adding more conditions to the qualifying list, but the bill he signed Wednesday did not do so. Local governments and schools can decide not to participate in the state program.",

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued new guidance on Thursday saying the screening should be done at the first prenatal visit, during the third trimester and at birth. Though the screening isn\u2019t required, health professionals generally follow the group\u2019s recommendations. \u201cThe cases of congenital syphilis are definitely climbing, and they\u2019ve been climbing over the last 10 years.

It\u2019s unacceptable,\" said Dr. Laura Riley, who chairs the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine and helped with the guidance. \"We need to be able to do better diagnostics and treatment.\u201d Previously, the group recommended one test in the third trimester \u2014 but only for women considered at risk of getting syphilis during pregnancy or those living in communities with high rates of the disease. But this risk-based approach is \u201chow we get into trouble because we\u2019re missing cases,\u201d Riley said. Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said more than 3,700 babies were born with congenital syphilis in 2022, the most in more than 30 years. U.S. health officials called for stepping up prevention, including screening which is done with a blood test. In its advisory, the OB-GYN group said CDC statistics show nearly 9 in 10 congenital syphilis cases that year \"could have been prevented with timely screening and treatment.\u201d Infections during pregnancy are generally treated with at least two doses of penicillin. Babies born to women with untreated syphilis may be stillborn or die shortly after birth. The disease can also cause other problems in newborns, such as deformed bones, severe anemia, blindness or deafness. \u201cI hope that everyone takes it seriously,\" Riley said. Kids with congenital syphilis may have birth defects that can be devastating \u2014 \"which is incredibly sad.\u201d ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "date": "2024-04-18 13:15:00",
            "content": "HOWELL, Mich. -- A Michigan judge on Thursday suddenly postponed the sentencing of a man at the center of a fatal meningitis outbreak that hit multiple states, dismaying people who were poised to speak about their grief 12 years after the tragedy. The judge who took a no-contest plea from Barry Cadden retired in March. But the defense attorney and the prosecutor said they still expected Michael Hatty would return to impose a minimum 10-year prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter. Instead, Judge Matthew McGivney inherited the case. He postponed the sentencing until May 10 to clear up the confusion, upsetting many people who were ready to give statements. A woman cried outside the Livingston County courtroom, 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. Peggy Nuerenberg, whose 88-year-old mother, Mary Plettl, died after getting a tainted steroid injection for pain, said she was \u201cabsolutely blindsided.\" \u201cHow things developed today were disrespectful to the victims who worked hard to prepare statements on behalf of their loved one,\" Nuerenberg told The Associated Press. Another knotty issue: McGivney's wife works for the state attorney general's office, which is prosecuting Cadden. \u201cI'm not inclined to disqualify myself,\u201d the judge said. Michigan is the only state to prosecute Cadden for deaths related to mold-tainted steroids created at New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, and shipped to pain clinics around the country. More than 700 people in 20 states were sickened with meningitis or other debilitating illnesses and at least 64 died, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cadden and a key employee at the lab, Glenn Chin, were charged with second-degree murder for 11 of Michigan's 19 deaths. Cadden recently chose to plead no contest to involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors have agreed to a minimum sentence of 10 years of prison. But they also agreed to let the sentence run at the same time as Cadden's current 14 1/2-year prison term for federal crimes related to the scandal. That means he is unlikely to face additional time in custody for the Michigan deaths. \u201cIt's a joke,\" said Gene Keyes, whose 79-year-old mother, Sally Roe, died in 2012. \u201cThe attorney general said most of the families agreed to it to put this matter behind us. I was one who wanted to go to trial. He's not going to serve any more time and that's wrong.\u201d Keyes said Cadden put \u201cgreed over people.\u201d Compounding pharmacies make versions of medications that often aren\u2019t available through larger drugmakers. But Cadden's lab was a mess, investigators said, leading to the growth of mold in the manufacturing process. Chin has not reached a similar plea deal, court filings show, and his trial on 11 second-degree murder charges is pending. Separately, he is serving a 10 1/2-year federal sentence. Ken Borton survived the tainted steroids but still has chronic problems. Twelve years later, he walks with a cane, stutters with his speech and said he \u201ccan't remember anything.\u201d \u201cI'll never be what I used to be,\" Borton said outside court. ___ Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwritez",

            "date": "2024-04-18 13:06:00",
            "content": "Six months after a deadly mass shooting by an Army reservist, Maine lawmakers this week passed a wide-ranging package of new gun restrictions. Three months after a fatal school shooting, Iowa lawmakers this week passed legislation allowing trained teachers and staff to carry guns on school property. Two states. Two tragedies. Two different approaches to improving public safety. \u201cWe live in two different Americas, in essence,\" said Daniel Webster, a health policy professor affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. \u201cWe see terrible acts of gun violence; no one wants them, of course,\" Webster said. \"But we see this through different lenses.\u201d Legislatures in about 20 states already have passed measures this year to expand gun rights or restrict access to firearms. Dozens more proposals are pending. The divide continues a trend seen last year, when more than half the states enacted firearms legislation, with Democrats generally favoring more limits and Republicans more freedoms for gun owners. Maine has a tradition of hunting and gun ownership. But after an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 others in Lewiston, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills called for a variety of new laws aimed at preventing dangerous people from possessing guns and strengthening mental health services. Before adjourning its 2024 session early Thursday, lawmakers approved measures imposing a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases, expanding background checks on private gun sales and criminalizing sales to certain prohibited people. They also passed a ban on devices that convert semi-automatic firearms into rapid-firing weapons like machine guns, and enhanced an existing law that allows judges to temporarily remove guns from people during a mental health crisis. A gun safety coalition praised it as a significant step forward in response to constituents' concerns after the Lewiston shooting. But Republican state Sen. Lisa Keim criticized colleagues for \u201cusing the tragedy to advance legislation\u201d that had been unable to pass previously. In Perry, Iowa, a school principal and sixth-grade student died and several others were wounded when a 17-year-old student opened fire in January. A 2021 state law already allowed schools to authorize individuals to carry firearms, though some districts have not done so because of concerns about insurance coverage. The legislation given final approval Monday by the Republican-led Legislature builds upon the prior law by allowing teachers and staff who undergo gun safety training to get a professional permit to carry guns in schools. If they do, they would be protected from criminal or civil liability for use of reasonable force. The legislation also requires large school districts to station a police officer or private security guard at each high school, unless the school board votes not to do so. Most of those school districts already have security staff. Republican-led legislatures in Kentucky, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah also passed measures this year that would expand the ability of some people to bring guns into schools. A bill passed in Wyoming allots $480,000 to reimburse schools for the cost of training employees to carry guns on school property. Louisiana and South Carolina, led by Republican lawmakers and governors, each enacted laws allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit. The National Rifle Association, which supported the measures, said similar laws now exist in 29 states. By contrast, the Democrat-led Delaware Legislature passed legislation requiring people wanting to buy a handgun to first be fingerprinted, undergo training and obtain a state permit. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed a pair of new laws imposing restrictions. One sets a seven-day waiting period to purchase firearms \u2014 more than double the three-day period required by the federal government for a background check. Another new law in New Mexico prohibits carrying firearms within 100 feet (30 meters) of polling places, with an exemption for concealed-carry permit holders. Voting site restrictions on guns now exist in about one-third of the states and Washington, D.C., according to the gun-violence prevention group Giffords. Not all new gun policies diverge along partisan lines. Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year vetoed 30 gun-related bills passed by the Democratic-led General Assembly that he said would have trampled on constitutional rights. Yet Youngkin also signed some gun restrictions: One bans devices that convert semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. Another allows felony charges against parents who let a child have access to a firearm after being notified the child poses a threat of violence. While signing several gun rights measures, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon of Wyoming also vetoed legislation that would have allowed people to carry concealed guns in public schools and government meetings. Gordon cited concerns the bill could have exceeded the separation of powers provision in the state constitution. And in some cases, high-profile shootings have prompted lawmakers to avoid taking action on proposals they might otherwise have considered. Missouri's Republican-led House had been prepared to debate bills exempting guns and ammunition from sales taxes and allowing people with concealed-carry permits to bring guns onto public transportation. But after the deadly shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl celebration, House Majority Leader Jon Patterson said those bills would not be brought up this year. ___ Associated Press writers David Sharp in Augusta, Maine, and Hannah Fingerhut in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.",

WHO authorized the vaccine, made by EuBiologics, which also makes the formulation now used, last week. The new version, called Euvichol-S, is a simplified formula that uses fewer ingredients, is cheaper, and can be made more quickly than the old version. The vaccine was shown to be help preventing the diarrheal disease in late stage research conducted in Nepal . WHO\u2019s approval means donor agencies like the vaccines alliance Gavi and UNICEF can now buy it for poorer countries. Leila Pakkala, director of UNICEF\u2019s supply division, said in a statement that the agency will be able to boost supplies by more than 25%. Gavi estimated there could be about 50 million doses for the global stockpile this year, compared with 38 million last year. Dr. Derrick Sim of Gavi called WHO\u2019s authorization \u201ca lifeline for vulnerable communities around the world.\u201d More is still needed, however: Since January, 14 countries affected by cholera outbreaks have requested 79 million doses. In January, the U.N. agency said the global vaccine stockpile was \u201centirely depleted\u201d until the beginning of March. As of this week, WHO said there were 2.3 million doses available. Cholera is an acute diarrhea disease caused by a bacteria typically spread via contaminated food or water. It is mostly seen in areas that have poor sanitation and lack access to clean water. While most people infected with cholera don't experience symptoms, those with severe cases need quick treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. If left untreated, cholera kills about a quarter to half of people infected. Since last January, WHO has reported more than 824,000 cholera infections, including 5,900 deaths worldwide, with the highest numbers of cases reported in the Middle East and Africa. The U.N. agency said warming temperatures that allow the cholera bacteria to live longer, have also worsened outbreaks and led to the highest death rates in a decade. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

In the analysis from the organization, which is aimed at promoting equitable health care, researchers found health system performance is markedly worse for many people of color compared to white people. \"Even among high performing states, we see significant disparities,\" Joseph Betancourt, M.D., President of the Commonwealth Fund, said in a report on the organization\u2019s updated findings. Six states were found to have better-than-average health system performance among all racial or ethnic groups, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Hawaii, New Hampshire and New York.

Black, and American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people are more likely to die before age 75 from preventable and treatable causes, including, but not limited to, some infections such as appendicitis and certain cancers, than white populations, according to the analysis. There are also large disparities in health care access between white people and other racial or ethnic groups across all states. Despite coverage expansion by the Affordable Care Act in recent years, states' uninsured rates are generally higher and more variable for Black, Hispanic, and AIAN adults compared to Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) and white adults, according to the analysis. In particular, Hispanic people had the highest uninsured rates and cost-related difficulties in accessing care in almost all states. \"These groups have more problems accessing care and if quality of care is lower, then they have worse health outcomes compared to white people in many states,\" Senior Scientist David Radley, Ph.D., of the Commonwealth Fund, said in the report.

            "date": "2024-04-17 19:44:00",
            "content": "PHOENIX -- Democrats in the Arizona Senate cleared a path to bring a proposed repeal of the state\u2019s near-total ban on abortions to a vote after the state\u2019s highest court concluded the law can be enforced and the state House blocked efforts to undo the long-dormant statute. Although no vote was taken on the repeal itself, Republican Sens. T.J. Shope and Shawnna Bolick sided with 14 Democrats in the Senate on Wednesday in changing rules to let a repeal proposal advance after the deadline for hearing bills had passed. Proponents say the Senate could vote on the repeal as early as May 1. If the proposed repeal wins final approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature and is signed into law by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, the 2022 statute banning the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy would become the prevailing abortion law. The move by the Senate came after Republicans in the Arizona House, for the second time in a week, blocked attempts on Wednesday to bring a repeal bill to a vote. One Republican joined 29 Democrats in the Arizona House to bring the repeal measure to a vote Wednesday, but the effort failed twice on 30-30 votes. The state\u2019s near-total ban, which predates Arizona\u2019s statehood, permits abortions only for saving the woman\u2019s life and provides no exceptions for rape or incest. It carries a sentence of two to five years in prison for doctors or anyone else who assists in an abortion. Last week, the Arizona Supreme Court drastically altered the legal landscape for terminating pregnancies in the state, concluding the 1864 law can be enforced and suggesting doctors can be prosecuted under the statute. The debate in the House over whether to allow a vote on the repeal proposal was much fierier than in the Senate. Members from pro-life groups packed the House\u2019s gallery and gave a standing ovation after efforts to bring the repeal bill to a vote was defeated. House Speaker Ben Toma said those wanting to repeal the law were demanding action too soon, noting the court decision to revive the law came only a week ago. He said the only way he would bring the repeal bill to a vote would be if his fellow Republicans wanted it. \u201cWe have deeply held beliefs,\u201d Toma said. \u201cAnd I would ask everyone in this chamber to respect the fact that someone wants to believe that abortion is in fact the murder of children.\u201d Democratic Rep. Alma Hernandez of Tucson said Republicans are failing to act on a matter of great importance to Arizonans. \u201cThis is what we are arguing about right now: whether or not we should overturn something that is archaic, something that is going to really impact women in Arizona,\" Hernandez said. \"And yet we want to talk about a process or the right process.\u201d Rep. Matt Gress, the Phoenix Republican who joined with Democrats in trying to bring the repeal measure to a vote, said the 160-year-old law doesn\u2019t reflect the values of most people living in the state. \u201cWe need to get that taken care of and get it taken care of as soon as possible,\u201d Gress said. \u201cI think the eyes of the nation are on Arizona.\u201d In a statement, Hobbs, who supports a repeal of the law, said, \u201cRepublican extremists in the House have yet again failed to do the right thing. In just one week living under this new reality, women, doctors, and healthcare providers have already begun to feel the devastating effects of living under a total abortion ban. We cannot go on like this.\u201d The Center for Arizona Policy, a longtime backer of anti-abortion proposals before the Legislature, released a statement saying, \u201cToday was a victory for life, even if only temporarily. Most pro-life lawmakers kept their promise today to protect the unborn and their mothers and not repeal Arizona\u2019s pre-Roe law.\u201d The Civil War era law had been blocked since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion nationwide. After Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, persuaded a state judge to lift an injunction that blocked enforcement of the 1864 ban. Brnovich\u2019s Democratic successor, Attorney General Kris Mayes, urged the state\u2019s high court to hold the line against it. The state\u2019s highest court said enforcement of the 1864 law won\u2019t begin for at least two weeks. However, it could be up to two months, based on an agreement reached in a related case in Arizona. ____ Associated Press writer Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report.",

Nearly 12 years later, the operator of New England Compounding Center is returning to a Michigan court Thursday for his sentence for involuntary manslaughter. Barry Cadden already is serving a 14 1/2-year sentence for federal crimes related to the extraordinary outbreak of fungal infections, which was traced to dirty conditions inside the lab and caused meningitis and other debilitating illnesses. More than 700 people in 20 states were sickened, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Michigan is the only state that charged Cadden and a key employee, pharmacist Glenn Chin, in any deaths. Cadden, 57, recently pleaded no contest to 11 counts of involuntary manslaughter in a deal that took second-degree murder charges off the table. Prosecutors also agreed to a minimum prison term of 10 years, which will run at the same time as the federal sentence. That means he is unlikely to face additional time in custody, an outcome that disappoints Michael Kruzich. \"My mother is gone, and Cadden and Chin are responsible. My family would like to see Cadden go to trial. It feels like they\u2019ve run out the clock and they just want it to be done,\u201d he said, referring to state prosecutors. Attorney General Dana Nessel said most of the 11 families supported the plea agreement. \u201cWe've ensured that this plea fits their desire for closure and justice,\u201d she said in a written statement on March 5. Cadden's attorney, Gerald Gleeson II, declined to comment ahead of the sentencing. In federal court in Boston in 2017, Cadden said he was sorry for the \u201cwhole range of suffering\u201d that occurred. Chin has not reached a similar plea deal, court filings show, and his trial on 11 second-degree murder charges is pending in the same Livingston County court, 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. Separately, he is serving a 10 1/2-year federal sentence. New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, operated in a little-known but vital corner of the U.S. health care system. Compounding pharmacies make versions of medications that often aren't available through larger drugmakers. Children, for example, might need a customized dose that is different than what's common for adults. \u201cThey're very important,\u201d said Eric Kastango, a pharmacist and industry expert who testified for prosecutors in Cadden's federal trial. \u201cI don't think the general public is necessarily aware what pharmacists do. They know they go into a hospital and they might need an IV. They might not know who made it or how they made it.\u201d In 2012, New England Compounding was shipping pain-relieving steroids to doctors across the U.S., including a clinic in Brighton, Michigan, where Donna Kruzich and others received treatment. But the lab was a mess, leading to the growth of mold in the manufacturing process. \u201cThe environment quickly spiraled out of control,\u201d Michigan prosecutors said in a court filing last June. Investigators \u201cuncovered a company placing profits over human lives. Barry Cadden was the \u2018big boss\u2019 at NECC who made many of the company's important decisions,\" the state said. \u201cHe cut corners on safety.\u201d Crime victims can speak in court in Michigan. Michael Kruzich, 70, said he doesn't plan to attend Thursday, although he submitted a poem on his family's behalf. He told The Associated Press that his mother was a \u201chealthy, happy woman\u201d who loved to travel and was treasurer of her golf league in the Ann Arbor area. \u201cI was told 12 years ago, that you cannot harm someone more than killing them,\u201d Kruzich said in his poem. \"I\u2019ve come to disagree \u2014 you can harm them more, when justice fails them.\" ___ Associated Press researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this story. ___ Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwritez",

            "date": "2024-04-17 11:54:00",
            "content": "Three court rulings across the U.S. this week delved into laws restricting the rights of transgender kids, including the first time the U.S. Supreme Court has gotten involved in a ban on gender-affirming care. Most Republican-controlled states have now banned gender-affirming health care such as puberty blockers and hormones for transgender minors, and blocked transgender girls from participating in girls sports competitions. Most of the measures face legal challenges, and this week's rulings went both ways. The Supreme Court said Idaho can enforce its ban against gender-affirming health for minors while lawsuits proceed. An Ohio state judge put on hold a law against health care and sports participation that was about to kick in there. And a federal appeals court ruled that West Virginia cannot keep a transgender girl from participating on her school's track team. Here are things to know about the court rulings and the latest legislative action. On Tuesday, an Ohio judge blocked enforcement of a law that was to take effect on April 24, banning gender-affirming care for minors and keeping transgender girls off girls sports teams at schools. Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook said in his written opinion that it's likely the law, adopted in January with a legislative override of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine's veto, violates a requirement that the state's laws address just one issue. He noted that lawmakers added the ban on gender-affirming care to the sports-related legislation because they were unable to adopt it separately. The ban on enforcement is in effect for two weeks or until a judge holds a hearing for a request to halt enforcement while the case works its way through the courts. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Idaho can enforce its ban on providing puberty blockers or hormones to minors. The law also bans gender-affirming surgery, which is extremely rare for those under 18 anyway. At least two dozen states have put similar bans into law in the last few years, nearly all of them challenged in court. Twenty other states are currently enforcing them. The Idaho ruling was the first time the issue reached the Supreme Court. But the justices did not dive into the constitutionality of the ban. Instead, they ruled 6-3 that enforcement can proceed, except against the two transgender teens who sued. And most of the justice's written opinions dealt with judicial procedure, exploring whether it's proper for courts to impose universal injunctions blocking laws while questions about them move through the courts. The first ban on gender-affirming care for minors was adopted by Arkansas in 2021. It was also the first to be blocked entirely \u2014 not just temporarily \u2014 by a federal court. Last week, 10 judges on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis heard arguments on Arkansas' appeal of the ruling that blocked the law. Circuit court appeals often take months to decide, and any ruling is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has already been asked to block similar laws that are in effect in Kentucky and Tennessee. A three-judge panel from another federal appeals court, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit, ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the West Virginia's ban against girls sports competition by transgender girls violates the rights of one teen athlete who challenged it. The result: 13-year-old Becky Pepper Jackson, who has identified as a girl since she was in third grade, can stay on her middle school's girls cross country and track and field teams. Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that the ban remains in place for others, though an ACLU-West Virginia spokesperson said it's not clear that there are any other kids in the state are impacted by the law. Other judges have temporarily blocked enforcement in Arizona, Idaho and Utah. But the New York City-based 2nd Circuit revived a challenge to Connecticut\u2019s policy of letting transgender girls compete in girls sports, sending it back to a lower court last year without ruling on its merits. At least 24 states have laws or policies on the books barring transgender girls and women from certain sports competitions, and most are enforcing them. And some local bans are being litigated: A federal judge ruled refused to block the New York state government from taking legal action against Nassau County's ban, which is also being challenged by a local roller derby league. The pace of Republican efforts to pass state restrictions has slowed this year, but measures before legislatures continue to target transgender people. On Monday, Tennessee lawmakers gave near-final passage to a bill that would require public school employees to notify parents if their student identifies in school as transgender. States including Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, North Carolina already have similar laws in place. Last week, Alabama lawmakers advanced legislation to define who is considered a man or a woman based on reproductive systems rather than gender identity. Lawmakers in more than a dozen states also are seeking this year to codify a definition of the sexes.",

            "date": "2024-04-17 09:30:00",
            "content": "Millions of people around the world will pause on Monday, at least for a moment, to mark Earth Day. It's an annual event founded by people who hoped to stir activism to clean up and preserve a planet that is now home to some 8 billion humans and assorted trillions of other organisms. Here are answers to some common questions about Earth Day and how it came to be: WHY DO WE CELEBRATE EARTH DAY? Earth Day has its roots in growing concern over pollution in the 1960s, when author Rachel Carson's 1962 book \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d about the pesticide DDT and its damaging effects on the food chain, hit bestseller lists and raised awareness about nature's delicate balance. But it was a senator from Wisconsin, Democrat Gaylord Nelson, who had the idea that would become Earth Day. Nelson had long been concerned about the environment when a massive offshore oil spill sent millions of gallons onto the southern California coast in 1969. Nelson, after touring the spill site, had the idea of doing a national \u201cteach-in\u201d on the environment, similar to teach-ins being held on some college campuses at the time to oppose the war in Vietnam. Nelson and others, including activist Denis Hayes, worked to expand the idea beyond college campuses, with events all around the country, and came up with the Earth Day name. WHY WAS APRIL 22 CHOSEN FOR EARTH DAY? A history of the movement by EarthDay.org, where Hayes remains board chair emeritus, says the date of the first Earth Day \u2014 April 22, 1970 \u2014 was chosen because it fell on a weekday between spring break and final exams and the aim was to attract as many students as possible. IS EARTH DAY A REAL HOLIDAY? It's not a federal holiday. But many groups use the day to put together volunteer events with the environment in mind, such as cleanups of natural areas. You can see a list of events worldwide, or register your own event, at EarthDay.org. HAS IT HAD AN IMPACT? It has. The overwhelming public response to the first Earth Day is credited with adding pressure for the U.S. Congress to do more to address pollution, and it did, passing landmark legislation including the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. More broadly, it's seen as the birth of the modern environmental movement. In later years, Earth Day expanded to become a truly global event. It now claims to have motivated action in more than 192 countries. In 2000, Earth Day began taking aim at climate change, a problem that has grown rapidly more urgent in recent years. WHAT'S THE THEME THIS YEAR? This year's Earth Day is focusing on the threat that plastics pose to our environment, with a call to end all single-use plastic and find replacements for their use so they can quickly be phased down. ___ The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "content": "GENEVA -- A new study says an African woman is roughly 130 times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth complications than a woman in Europe or North America, the U.N. population fund reported Wednesday as it decried widening inequality in sexual and reproductive health and rights worldwide. UNFPA's latest \u201c State of World Population \u201d report also estimates that nearly 500 maternal deaths per day occur in countries with humanitarian crises or conflicts, and shows that women of African descent in the Americas are more likely to die giving birth than white women. \u201cSweeping global gains in sexual and reproductive health and rights over the last thirty years are marred by an ugly truth \u2014 millions of women and girls have not benefited because of who they are or where they were born,\u201d the fund said in a statement. UNFPA executive director Dr. Natalia Kanem said the unintended pregnancy rate has declined by nearly one-fifth since 1990 and the maternal death rate has dropped by more than one-third since 2000. But \u201cinequalities within our societies and health systems are widening, and we have not adequately prioritized reaching those furthest behind,\u201d she said. Improvements in health care access have mostly benefited wealthier women and members of ethnic groups with better access to care, the fund said. Kanem hailed some progress: More than 160 countries have passed laws against domestic violence, and \u201clegislation against LGBTQIA+ sexuality\u201d that was once widespread has been on the retreat. Now only one-third of countries have such laws. While she credited \u201cthe world's agreement\u201d that led to such gains, Kanem also warned: \u201cHuman reproduction is being politicized. The rights of women, girls and gender diverse people are the subject of increasing pushback.\" \u201cAnd yet, today, that progress is slowing. By many measures, it has stalled completely,\" she said. \u201cAnnual reductions in maternal deaths have flatlined. Since 2016, the world made zero progress in saving women from preventable deaths in pregnancy and childbirth.\u201d \u201cHealth systems today are weak,\" Kanem added. \"They\u2019re tainted by gender inequality, by racial discrimination and by misinformation.\u201d The fund called for new investment in sexual and reproductive health, as well as improvements in sexuality education, stopping gender-based violence, and \u201cending unmet need for contraception\u201d \u2014 an issue that has driven a wedge in some countries. Under the term of U.S. President Donald Trump , the United States halted funding for UNFPA largely over concerns about abortion \u2014 depriving the fund of tens of millions of dollars over four years.",

            "date": "2024-04-16 17:56:00",
            "content": "Forced to hide her true self, Joe Horras\u2019 transgender daughter struggled with depression and anxiety until three years ago, when she began to take medication to block the onset of puberty. The gender-affirming treatment helped the now-16-year-old find happiness again, her father said. A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court late Monday allowing Idaho to enforce its ban on such care for minors could jeopardize her wellbeing once again. Horras is scrambling to figure out next steps and is considering leaving Idaho, where he's lived his whole life, to move to another state. \"It would be devastating for her,\" Horras, who lives in Boise, told The Associated Press. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t have access to that, it will damage her mental health.\" Horras is among the Idaho parents desperate to find solutions after their trans children lost access to the gender-affirming care they were receiving. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision allows the state to put in place a 2023 law that subjects physicians to up to 10 years in prison if they provide hormones, puberty blockers or other gender-affirming care to people under age 18. A federal judge in Idaho had previously blocked the law in its entirety. The ruling will hold while lawsuits against the law proceed through the lower courts, although the two transgender teens who sued to challenge the law will still be able to obtain care. At least 24 states have adopted bans on gender-affirming care for minors in recent years, and most of them face legal challenges. Twenty of those states besides Idaho are currently enforcing the bans. Monday\u2019s ruling was the first time the U.S. Supreme Court waded into the issue. The court\u2019s 6-3 ruling steered clear of whether the ban itself is constitutional. Instead, the justices went deep into whether it\u2019s appropriate to put enforcement of a law on hold for everyone, or just those who sue over it, while it works its way through the courts. In his concurring opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch said \u201clower courts would be wise to take heed\u201d and limit use of \u201cuniversal injunctions\u201d blocking all enforcement of laws that face legal challenges. In a dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the court should not decide the fate of those actions without reading legal briefs and hearing arguments on the issue. Rights groups in Idaho are supporting families to make sure they're aware the measure has taken effect. The American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho said it plans to hold a virtual event over Zoom with licensed counselors and legal experts to help people process the shock and answer any questions they may have about the law. \u201cYesterday was really just an outpouring of fear, questions, people trying to figure out how this is going to affect them personally,\u201d said Jenna Damron, the group's advocacy fellow. \u201cGetting information out quickly that is accurate is kind of our first priority.\u201d Paul Southwick, legal director for ACLU of Idaho, said the group wants families to know what their options are. \u201cGender-affirming medical care is now immediately illegal for minors in the state of Idaho. However, care remains legal for adults, and it\u2019s also legal for minors to seek gender-affirming medical care out of state,\u201d he said. In Boise, Horras' 16-year-old daughter wears an estrogen patch and receives estrogen injections every six months. Her last shot was in December and Horras now has two months to find a new out-of-state provider who can continue administering the medication. The situation has left him feeling scared, he said, and angry toward the state politicians who passed the law last year. \u201cIt's cruel,\u201d he said. Advocates, meanwhile, worry that lower-income families won't be able to afford to travel across state lines for care. Arya Shae Walker, a transgender man and activist in the small city of Twin Falls in rural southern Idaho, said he was concerned that people would alter the doses of their current prescriptions in order to make them last longer. His advocacy group has already taken down information on its website on gender-affirming care providers for young people in the area out of concern of potential legal consequences. The broader issue of bans on gender-affirming care for minors could eventually be before the U.S. Supreme Court again. Last year, a ban on gender-affirming care for minors in Arkansas was shot down by a federal judge, while those in Kentucky and Tennessee were allowed to be enforced by an appeals court after being put on hold by lower-court judges. Montana\u2019s law is not being enforced because of a ruling from a state judge. Laws barring transgender youth from playing on sports teams that align with their gender identity are also being challenged across the country. An appeals court on Tuesday ruled that West Virginia\u2019s transgender sports ban violates the rights of a teen athlete under Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools. Hours later, an Ohio law that bars transgender girls from girls scholastic sports competitions was put on hold by a judge. Set to take effect next week, the law also bans gender-affirming care for transgender youth. Those who support the bans say they want to protect children and have concerns about the treatments themselves. Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by major medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association. However, England is limiting the ability of people younger than 16 to begin a medical gender transition. The National Health Service England recently cemented a policy first issued on an interim basis almost a year ago that sets a minimum age at which puberty blockers can be started, along with other requirements. NHS England says there is not enough evidence about their long-term effects, including \u201csexual, cognitive or broader developmental outcomes.\u201d Medical professionals define gender dysphoria as psychological distress experienced by those whose gender expression does not match their gender identity. Experts say gender-affirming therapy can lead to lower rates of depression, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among transgender people. Chelsea Gaona-Lincoln, executive director of Idaho-based advocacy group Add The Words, said she's anticipating \u201ca pretty horrendous ripple effect.\u201d But seeing her community uniting in support has given her a glimmer of hope. \u201cThere are people coming together, and it\u2019s so important, for especially our youth, to feel seen and affirmed as they are,\" she said. Southwick, the legal director of ACLU of Idaho, said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to hold a hearing this summer on its lawsuit challenging the law. ___ Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed. ___ This story was first published on April 16, 2024. It was updated on April 18, 2024, to make clear that the 20 states enforcing bans on gender-affirming care for minors are in addition to Idaho and all are among the 24 that have passed laws imposing the bans.",

The injections were either counterfeit or administered by unlicensed or untrained individuals and/or in non-health care settings, including homes or spas, according to the CDC. On Tuesday, the FDA issued an alert to health care professionals and consumers that \"unsafe counterfeit versions of Botox\" were found in multiple states, warning that bogus or mishandled Botox products can lead to serious complications. MORE: Demand for back-to-school Botox rising for some moms What is Botox? Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxic protein made from a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It blocks chemical signals from the nerves that cause muscles to contract. The muscles temporarily relax, reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Botox is the most common brand name of the injection. A counterfeit box of botulinum toxin, or Botox. Several people in the U.S. have fallen ill after receiving counterfeit or mishandled Botox injections, according to the CDC. CDC.gov Botox is most often used on the face to reduce forehead lines, frown lines and crow's feet but can also be used for people with excessive underarm sweating, muscle disorders such as cerebral palsy, neck spasms, overactive bladder, migraines and other conditions. Why can Botox injections be dangerous? Forms of purified botulinum toxin are approved by the FDA for certain medical and cosmetic treatments, according to the Mayo Clinic . They are considered safe when administered by licensed health care providers who meet medical control standards as dictated by the FDA. However, when Botox is not correctly prepared, stored or administered, it can lead to a rare but serious illness called botulism, which is when the toxin attacks the body's nerves. This can cause muscle paralysis, difficulty breathing and even death. Botulism is treated with an antitoxin, which prevents the toxin from causing any more harm, according to the CDC . Fewer than five of every 100 people with botulism die, the agency says.

If you receive the injection and are experiencing any symptoms of botulism, the CDC says to see your health care provider or to go to the emergency room immediately. How to tell if a Botox product is counterfeit AbbVie and Allergan -- which is part of AbbVie -- are the only approved Botox manufacturers and there is currently no evidence the harmful reactions are linked to the genuine product, according to the FDA. There are some signs that a version may be counterfeit, including the outer carton and vial containing lot number C3709C3 as well as the outer carton displaying the active ingredient as \"Botulinum Toxin Type A\" instead of \"OnabotulinumtoxinA.\" If the outer carton and vial indicates 150-unit doses, this is counterfeit because it is not a unit made by AbbVie or Allergan. Genuine products come in 50-, 100- and 200-unit doses. Additionally, outer cartons that contain a language that is not English are counterfeit. People who suspect counterfeit Botox products are encouraged to file a report with the FDA.",

            "date": "2024-04-16 11:40:00",
            "content": "CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas -- A federal judge is fining Texas $100,000 per day for routinely neglecting to adequately investigate allegations of abuse and neglect raised by children in the state\u2019s struggling foster care system. U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack in Corpus Christi ruled Monday that the Texas Health and Human Services agency has shown contempt of her orders to fix the way the state investigates complaints by children in its care. This is the third such contempt finding in a case that began with a 2011 lawsuit over foster care conditions at the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, the child welfare arm of HHS. In a 427-page ruling, the judge cited a \u201ccontinued recalcitrance\u201d by the agency's Provider Investigations unit to conduct thorough, accurate and timely probes of allegations of abuse, neglect and exploitation. \u201cAs demonstrated by the stories of the children and PI\u2019s failure to take any action to remedy the egregious flaws identified by the Monitors, PI represents a significant, systemic failure that increases the risk of serious harm,\u201d the judge wrote. Texas has about 9,000 children in permanent state custody for factors that include the loss of caregivers, abuse at home or health needs that parents alone can\u2019t meet. \u201cThe judge\u2019s ruling is measured but urgent, given the shocking evidence,\u201d said attorney Paul Yetter, representing the foster children in the lawsuit. \u201cInnocent children are suffering every day. After all these years, when will state leadership get serious about fixing this disaster?\u201d Officials at the DFPS declined comment. A spokesperson at HHS said the agency, led by Commissioner Cecile E. Young, was reviewing the order. Lawyers for the state have previously said that while there is always room for improvement, state officials have sufficiently complied with the court\u2019s remedial orders. The state has also argued that the court monitors haven\u2019t reviewed a large enough sample size of children to make sweeping conclusions. The fines levied against Texas will be lifted when the state can demonstrate that its investigations are in compliance. A hearing is set for late June. Since 2019, court-appointed monitors have released periodic reports on DFPS progress toward eliminating threats to the foster children\u2019s safety. A January report cited progress in staff training, but continued weaknesses in responding to investigations into abuse and neglect allegations, including those made by children. Monitors also said children aren\u2019t told how to report sexual abuse and the state hasn't proved that it has properly trained its caseworkers to identify potential victims. In one case, plaintiffs say, a girl was left in the same residential facility for a year while 12 separate investigations piled up around allegations that she had been raped by a worker there. The girl remained exposed to that worker until she was \u201cdumped in an emergency room, alone, with her jaw broken in two places,\u201d the judge said. The facility was eventually shut down by the state.",

            "date": "2024-04-16 07:43:00",
            "content": "LONDON -- The British government's plan for a landmark smoking ban that aims to stop young people from ever smoking cleared its first hurdle in Parliament on Tuesday despite vocal opposition from within Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party. The bill, a key policy announced by Sunak last year, would make it illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone born after January 1, 2009. If passed, the bill will give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world. Authorities say it will create modern Britain\u2019s \u201cfirst smoke-free generation.\u201d Under the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, children turning 15 this year or younger will never be legally sold tobacco. Once implemented \u2014 officials are aiming for 2027 \u2014 the legal age of sale that people in England can buy cigarettes will be raised by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population. The bill also includes measures to crack down on youth vaping, such as banning the sale of cheap disposable vapes and restricting their flavors to prevent children from becoming addicted to nicotine. It is currently illegal for anyone to sell cigarettes or tobacco products and vapes to people under 18 years old throughout the U.K. During the bill\u2019s second reading late Tuesday, 383 lawmakers voted in favor while 67 opposed it after an afternoon of debate. Although the bill was widely praised by health experts and had the support of the opposition Labour Party, Sunak faced rebellion from more libertarian-minded members of his party, who criticized the proposals as \u201cunconservative.\u201d Opponents, such as the smokers' rights lobbying group FOREST, said the move risks creating a black market and will \u201ctreat future generations of adults like kids.\u201d Prominent voices within the Conservative Party, including two of Sunak's predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, said the plans went against conservative values by limiting people's personal freedoms. The bill was a \u201cvirtue-signaling piece of legislation about protecting adults from themselves in the future,\" Truss told Parliament during Tuesday's debate. Other high-profile Tories, including business secretary Kemi Badenoch, a Cabinet minister, also opposed the bill or abstained. Conservative lawmakers were granted a free vote, meaning they could vote with their personal conscience rather than follow the official party line. The plans were believed to have been inspired by similar policies proposed by New Zealand under former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but the country's new coalition government repealed the bill earlier this year. The government said that smoking won\u2019t be criminalized, and the phased changes mean that anyone who can legally buy cigarettes now won\u2019t be prevented from doing so in the future. The number of people who smoke in the U.K. has declined by two-thirds since the 1970s, but some 6.4 million people in the country \u2014 or about 13% of the population \u2014 still smoke, according to official figures. Authorities say smoking causes some 80,000 deaths a year in the U.K, and remains the number one preventable cause of death, disability and poor health.",

            "date": "2024-04-16 07:00:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden's administration will help 50 countries identify and respond to infectious diseases, with the goal of preventing pandemics like the COVID-19 outbreak that suddenly halted normal life around the globe in 2020. U.S. government officials will offer support in the countries, most of them located in Africa and Asia, to develop better testing, surveillance, communication and preparedness for such outbreaks in those countries. The strategy will help \u201cprevent, detect and effectively respond to biological threats wherever they emerge,\u201d Biden said in a statement Tuesday. The Global Health Security Strategy, the president said, aims to protect people worldwide and \"will make the United States stronger, safer, and healthier than ever before at this critical moment.\u201d The announcement about the strategy comes as countries have struggled to meet a worldwide accord on responses to future pandemics. Four years after the coronavirus pandemic, prospects of a pandemic treaty signed by all 194 of the World Health Organization\u2019s members are flailing. Talks for the treaty are ongoing, with a final text expected to be agreed upon next month in Geneva. It\u2019s meant to be a legally binding treaty that obliges countries to monitor pandemic threats and share scientific findings. But major disputes have emerged over vaccine equity and transferring the technology used to make vaccines . Even if a deal is hammered out, there would be few consequences for countries that choose not to abide by the treaty. The U.S. will push on with its global health strategy to prevent future pandemics, regardless of a pandemic treaty or not, a senior administration official told reporters on Monday. Several U.S. government agencies \u2014 including the State Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health and Human Services and the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID \u2014 will help countries refine their infectious disease response. Health systems around the globe have been overwhelmed with COVID-19 and other health emergencies such as Ebola, malaria and mpox, the CDC said in a statement. The new strategy will help countries rebuild their agencies, the U.S. agency explained. \u201cGlobal health security is national security, and CDC is proud to contribute its expertise, investments and rapid response to protect the health and safety of the American people and the world,\u201d Mandy Cohen, the CDC's director, said in a statement. Congo is one country where work has already begun. The U.S. government is helping Congo with its response to an mpox virus outbreak, including with immunizations. Mpox, a virus that's in the same family as the one that causes smallpox, creates painful skin lesions. The World Health Organization declared mpox a global emergency in 2022, and there have been more than 91,000 cases spanning across 100 countries to date. The White House on Tuesday released a website with the names of the countries that are participating in the program. Biden officials are seeking to get 100 countries signed onto the program by the end of the year. The U.S. has devoted billions of dollars, including money raised from private donations, to the effort. Biden, a Democrat, is asking for $1.2 billion for global health safety efforts in his yearly budget proposal to Congress. \u2014 Associated Press writer Maria Cheng in London contributed.",

            "title": "Indiana limits abortion data for privacy under near-total ban, but some GOP candidates push back",
            "date": "2024-04-16 00:12:00",
            "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana allows so few abortions that health officials stopped releasing individual reports to protect patient privacy \u2014 a move some Republicans are now fighting to reverse. The Republicans, including prominent candidates for office this year, want access to reports detailing each abortion still performed in the state. Advocates for abortion rights and some state officials warn that would jeopardize the privacy of physicians and patients who can only receive abortions under strict circumstances. The state bans abortions except within limited time frames in cases of rape, incest, lethal fetal anomaly and serious health risks to the patient. Like many states, Indiana has long collected data on abortions, but the Department of Health last year decided to keep the individual reports from public record and only release its regular summary data four times a year to make it harder to potentially identify patients. Indiana law requires physicians to submit \u201cterminated pregnancy reports\u201d with demographic and medical history information to the health department. The reports do not name patients but can list their zip code and county of residence, and they're rarely released in states that collect them, according to experts. In the days following the overturn of Roe v. Wade, an individual record obtained by the Indianapolis Star through a public records request confirmed an abortion provided to a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio. The topic has gradually become a political football as Indiana's competitive primary for governor approaches in early May. In January, Republican gubernatorial candidate and former Attorney General Curtis Hill called on the health department and Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to allow the release of individual reports. Republican Lt. Gov. and gubernatorial candidate Suzanne Crouch pledged in a March post to X to make the reports public record if she is elected. And on Thursday, Attorney General Todd Rokita, who is running for reelection, issued an advisory opinion arguing the reports should be public record. The opinion doesn't change any practices but was in response to an inquiry from state Sen. Andy Zay, a congressional candidate, Rokita's office said. Voters should ask the field of gubernatorial candidates to take a stance, Rokita said during a Thursday news conference. After Rokita released his opinion, the health department said the reports are not public record, and pointed to an informal opinion written by an appointed open records official in December. Rokita argued the reports are not medical records and could show whether an abortion was performed legally. Without the reports, he said, \u201cthere is no effective way\u201d to enforce the state's near-total ban. The Legislature should act next year if the department doesn't, Zay said Thursday. \u201cWe can use them as tools to hold those around the periphery of abortion clinics and abortion doctors accountable,\u201d Zay said of the reports. The individual reports ask patients for information including zip code, age, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, previous pregnancies, the date of their last period and the father's age, according to the most recent quarterly summary. Patients may refuse to answer questions, the department said. Physicians report information on the type of procedure, the reason for the abortion and an estimate of the length of the pregnancy. The individual reports also include the name of the physician, the name of the facility and the date of the abortion. Indiana's ban went into effect in August. From October to December, 46 terminated pregnancy reports were filed with the health department compared to 1,724 in the same period in 2022. It is not common for states to release individual abortion reports, said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a science-based research group that supports abortion rights. Jones said seeking individual reports is an effort to intimidate health care providers and patients. \u201cThere\u2019s no public health or even legal purpose for trying to impose this,\u201d Jones said. Rokita denied that the small number of reports makes it easier to identify patients and said that the health department can redact some information before making reports public. The attorney general has taken up multiple legal battles focused on abortion. He gave a televised interview criticizing an Indianapolis OBGYN who provided an abortion to the 10-year-old from Ohio. The Indiana Supreme Court found last year that some of Rokita\u2019s statement violated rules of professional conduct for attorneys. Rokita is weaponizing the reports, said Rebecca Gibron, CEO of the Planned Parenthood region that includes Indiana. \"Denying abortion as health care is an abuse of power, aiming to stigmatize vital services for political gain at the expense of Hoosier\u2019s access to essential health care \u2014 even now when it is only accessible in the rarest of circumstances,\" Gibron said in a statement.",

            "title": "Weedkiller manufacturer seeks lawmakers' help to squelch claims it failed to warn about cancer",
            "date": "2024-04-16 00:08:00",
            "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Stung by paying billions of dollars for settlements and trials, chemical giant Bayer has been lobbying lawmakers in three states to pass bills providing it a legal shield from lawsuits that claim its popular weedkiller Roundup causes cancer. Nearly identical bills introduced in Iowa, Missouri and Idaho this year \u2014 with wording supplied by Bayer \u2014 would protect pesticide companies from claims they failed to warn that their product causes cancer, if their labels otherwise complied with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s regulations. But legal experts warn the legislation could have broader consequences \u2014 extending to any product liability claim or, in Iowa\u2019s case, providing immunity from lawsuits of any kind. Critics say it could spread nationwide. \"It\u2019s just not good government to give a company immunity for things that they\u2019re not telling their consumers,\u201d said Matt Clement, a Jefferson City, Missouri, attorney who represents people suing Bayer. \u201cIf they\u2019re successful in getting this passed in Missouri, I think they\u2019ll be trying to do this all over the country.\u201d Bayer described the legislation as one strategy to address the \u201cheadwinds\u201d it faces. About 167,000 legal claims against Bayer assert Roundup causes a cancer called non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which Bayer disputes. The company has won some cases, settled many others but also has suffered several losses in which juries awarded huge initial judgments. It has paid about $10 billion while thousands of claims linger in court. Though some studies associate Roundup's key ingredient with cancer, the EPA has regularly concluded it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. The costs of \u201cdefending a safe, approved product\u201d are unsustainable, said Jess Christiansen, head of communications for Bayer's crop science division. The legislation was introduced in targeted states pivotal to Bayer's Roundup operations and is at a different stage in each. It passed the Iowa Senate, is awaiting debate in the Missouri House and was defeated in Idaho, where this year's legislative session ended. Farmers overwhelmingly rely on Roundup, which was introduced 50 years ago as a more efficient way to control weeds and reduce tilling and soil erosion. For crops like corn, soybeans and cotton, it\u2019s designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist Roundup\u2019s deadly effect. Missouri state Rep. Dane Diehl, a farmer who worked with Bayer to sponsor the legislation, cited concerns that costly lawsuits could force Bayer to pull Roundup from the U.S. market, leaving farmers to depend on alternative chemicals from China. \u201cThis product, ultimately, is a tool that we need,\" said Diehl, a Republican. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, said in an email the legislation maintains the integrity of the regulatory process and, without it, \u201cIowa risks losing hundreds of jobs\u201d in Muscatine, an eastern Iowa city where Roundup is mostly produced. The Associated Press is seeking public records on Bayer\u2019s communications with governor's offices in Iowa, Missouri and Idaho. Bayer, like other companies, hires lobbyists in states to advocate for its interests. The company backs this legislation in the states where \u201cwe have a big, direct economic impact,\u201d Christiansen said. Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, is derived from phosphate mined in Idaho. And St. Louis is the headquarters of its North America crop science division, acquired in its 2018 purchase of Monsanto. Because of that, many of the lawsuits are filed in Missouri. The five lobbyists registered for Bayer in Iowa and three in Idaho is largely consistent with recent years, but the number working in Missouri this year ballooned from four to nine. Lobbyist expenditures exceeded $8,000 in Idaho this year; similar information was not available in Iowa or Missouri. Led by Bayer, a coalition of agricultural organizations called Modern Ag Alliance also is spending tens of thousands of dollars on radio and print advertisements claiming that trial lawyers and litigation threaten the availability of glyphosate. On its website, the group asserts that at risk are 500 jobs connected to glyphosate production in Iowa, and 800 jobs in Idaho. Bayer stopped short of threatening closures. The Iowa facilities, including in Muscatine, \u201care very critical facilities to our business, so we'll remain at some sort of support level,\u201d Christiansen said. At issue in the lawsuits and legislation is how Bayer \u2013 and any other pesticide company \u2014 communicates with consumers about the safety of its products. Companies are required to register products with the EPA, which evaluates \u2014 and then reevaluates every 15 years \u2014 a pesticide and its label. The EPA reiterated in 2020 that glyphosate used as directed posed no health risks to humans. But a federal appeals court panel in 2022 ruled that decision \u201cwas not supported by substantial evidence\u201d and ordered the EPA to review further. The debate over glyphosate escalated when a 2015 report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, said it's \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\" based on \u201climited\u201d evidence of cancer in people and \u201csufficient\u201d evidence in study animals. Based on that international report, California sought to add a cancer warning label to products containing glyphosate. But a federal appeals court ruled against California last November, concluding such a warning wasn't factual. Christiansen emphasized that many regulatory agencies worldwide agree with the EPA and insisted Bayer has to stick to EPA labeling to ensure it isn't providing false or misleading information. She added that the company is transparent in the information it does provide. Critics of the legislation aren't convinced, citing examples such as opioids and asbestos that had been deemed safe for use as directed \u2014 until they weren't. There also are concerns that the legislation could stifle any product liability claim since most rely on the argument that a company failed to warn, said Andrew Mertens, executive director of the Iowa Association for Justice, an organization for trial lawyers. Jonathan Cardi, a product liability and torts expert at Wake Forest University School of Law, also said a strict reading of the Iowa legislation extends beyond liability claims, and \u201cthe way it\u2019s drafted makes it interpretable to mean nobody could bring any suit.\u201d In lobbying lawmakers and in speaking with the AP, Bayer representatives disputed that the legislation would cut off other legal actions. Several legal experts said the legislation is unlikely to affect the 18,000 lawsuits already pending in Missouri\u2019s capital of Jefferson City, and wouldn\u2019t prevent claims in states that don\u2019t adopt similar legislation. In Idaho, the Republican-led Senate narrowly defeated the bill amid concerns about relying on federal agencies' safety standards and limiting the ability of harmed individuals to sue. John Gilbert, who farms in Iowa Falls, Iowa, with limited use of Roundup, called Republicans hypocritical for attempting to protect corporate interests after campaigning on standing up for Iowans. The bill \u201cinvites a lot of reckless disregard,\" said Gilbert, who is on the board for the Iowa Farmers Union. \u201cNo amount of perfume\u2019s gonna make it anything but a skunk.\" ___ Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing Idaho to enforce its ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth while lawsuits over the law proceed, reversing lower courts. The justices' order Monday allows the state to put in a place a 2023 law that subjects physicians to up to 10 years in prison if they provide hormones, puberty blockers or other gender-affirming care to people under age 18. Under the court\u2019s order, the two transgender teens who sued to challenge the law still will be able to obtain care. The court's three liberal justices would have kept the law on hold. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that it would have been better to let the case proceed \u201cunfettered by our intervention.\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch of the conservative majority wrote that it is \u201ca welcome development\u201d that the court is reining in an overly broad lower court order. A federal judge in Idaho had blocked the law in its entirety after determining that it was necessary to do so to protect the teens, who are identified under pseudonyms in court papers. Lawyers for the teens wrote in court papers that the teens' \u201cgender dysphoria has been dramatically alleviated as a result of puberty blockers and estrogen therapy.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the teens and their families, called the Supreme Court's order \u201can awful result for transgender youth and their families across the state. Today\u2019s ruling allows the state to shut down the care that thousands of families rely on while sowing further confusion and disruption.\u201d Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador said in a statement that the law \u201censures children are not subjected to these life-altering drugs and procedures. Those suffering from gender dysphoria deserve love, support, and medical care rooted in biological reality. Denying the basic truth that boys and girls are biologically different hurts our kids.\u201d Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association. Medical professionals define gender dysphoria as psychological distress experienced by those whose gender expression does not match their gender identity. The action comes as the justices also may soon consider whether to take up bans in Kentucky and Tennessee that an appeals court allowed to be enforced in the midst of legal fights. At least 23 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. A federal judge struck down Arkansas\u2019 ban as unconstitutional. Montana\u2019s ban also is temporarily on hold. The states that have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.",

            "date": "2024-04-15 16:38:00",
            "content": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Paris Hilton joined California state lawmakers Monday to push for legislation aimed at cracking down on the industry that cares for troubled teens by requiring more transparency from youth treatment facilities. The bill supported by the Hilton Hotel heiress and media personality aims to pry open information on how short-term residential facilities for youth dealing with substance abuse and behavioral issues use disciplinary methods such as restraints or seclusion against minors. It would require such centers to notify parents and the state any time they use restrains or seclusion rooms for minors. It\u2019s authored by Republican state Sen. Shannon Grove and Democratic state Sens. Aisha Wahab and Angelique Ashby. On Monday, Hilton testified in a legislative hearing in support of the bill, detailing her harrowing abuse as a teenager at a facility in Utah that she said still haunts her and urging lawmakers to take actions before more children have to suffer similar treatment. \u201cOur current system designed to reform, in some horrific instances, does the exact opposite,\u201d Hilton told lawmakers Monday. \u201cIt breaks spirits and instills fear, and it perpetuates a cycle of abuse. But today, we have the power to change that.\u201d The California bill passed committee with bipartisan support on Monday. Under the bill, facilities would have to report details such as what disciplinary actions were taken, why and who had approved the plan. The state department regulating the facilities also would be required to make public the reports and update the database on the quarterly basis. It would not ban the use of such practices. Hilton has become a prominent advocate for more oversight and regulation of teen treatment centers after publicly sharing the physical and mental abuse she suffered as a teenager. She alleged staff members would beat her, force her to take unknown pills, watch her shower and send her to solitary confinement without clothes as punishment. In 2021, her testimony about her experience at Utah\u2019s Provo Canyon School helped pass a bill to impose stricter oversight over youth treatment centers in the state. Hilton has also traveled to Washington D.C. to advocate for federal reforms and helped changed laws to protect minors in at least eight states. Earlier this month, she spoke in support of boys sent to a private school for troubled teens in Jamaica. Hilton, whose company called 11:11 Media is sponsoring the bill, called the legislation \u201ca game changer\u201d that would shed light on child abuse at youth residential treatments and hold them accountable. \u201cThis would have been so helpful to myself and so many others to have known what was happening behind closed doors,\u201d Paris said in an interview. \u201cBecause I was cut off from the outside world, I couldn\u2019t tell my family anything, and that\u2019s what they do.\u201d Between 2015 and 2020, California sent more than 1,240 children with behavior problems to out-of-state facilities due to the lack of locked treatment centers for youths, according to Sen. Grove\u2019s office. As reports about abuse happening at these programs emerged, including an incident where a 16-year-old boy died after being restrained for about 12 minutes at a Michigan facility, California also found significant licensing violations at these facilities and decided to do away with the program in 2020. Legislation passed in 2021 formally banned the use of out-of-state residential centers. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also authorized $8 million to bring all the minors home by last year. Minors with behavioral issues are now sent to in-state short-term residential centers, which were created in 2017 to replace group homes. But under current laws, these facilities are not required to share information on how often they use seclusion rooms, restraints, and how many times those methods result in serious injuries or deaths. Children at these facilities make up one of the most vulnerable populations, including foster youths who have previously been sexually exploited, Grove said. \u201cIt\u2019s a small but critical step to ensure the increased transparency and accountability for California\u2019s children,\u201d she said Monday.",

            "date": "2024-04-15 16:05:00",
            "content": "HELENA, Mont. -- Thomas Wells ran a half-marathon at age 60 and played recreational volleyball until he was 63. At 65 years old, doctors diagnosed him with mesothelioma, a rare and aggressive lung cancer linked to asbestos exposure. \u201cI\u2019m in great pain and alls I see is this getting worse,\u201d the retired middle school teacher from Oregon said in a video deposition recorded in March 2020, four months after his cancer diagnosis. He died a day later. Portions of Wells' deposition were replayed Monday in a federal courtroom for a jury hearing a wrongful death case against Warren Buffett\u2019s BNSF Railway. The estates of Wells and a second mesothelioma victim accuse the railroad and its corporate predecessors in a lawsuit of polluting Libby, Montana, with asbestos-contaminated vermiculite from a nearby mine that was transported through the remote town\u2019s rail yard in boxcars for much of last century. BNSF attorneys have denied the claims and are scheduled to lay out their defense beginning Tuesday. They've said that railroad officials were unaware the shipments were hazardous. A cleanup of the contaminated rail yard in downtown Libby was largely completed in 2022. The trial is the first alleging BNSF exposed community members in Libby to asbestos fibers that can cause lung scarring and mesothelioma. It comes almost 25 years after federal authorities arrived in the community not far from the U.S.-Canada border following news reports about toxic asbestos dust causing widespread deaths and illnesses among mine workers and their families. Numerous other lawsuits from asbestos victims have been filed against BNSF. The W.R. Grace & Co. mine that operated on a mountaintop outside Libby produced contaminated vermiculite that health officials say has sickened more than 3,000 people and led to several hundred deaths. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 declared the first-ever public health emergency during a Superfund cleanup in Libby. It\u2019s one of the deadliest sites under the federal pollution program. The agency banned remaining industrial uses of asbestos last month. Wells said in the 2020 deposition that he believed he was sickened while working for the U.S. Forest Service in the Libby area for about six months each in 1976-78 and again in 1981. He never went to the vermiculite mine, he said, but described wind kicking up dust along the railroad tracks at the rail yard. \u201cIt was dusty. You know, you\u2019d wash the car and pretty soon you have to wash the car again,\u201d Wells said. The second plaintiff, Joyce Walder, played in the same area in her youth before dying of mesothelioma at 66. Mine operator W.R. Grace repeatedly told the railroad\u2019s corporate predecessors that the product it was shipping through Libby was safe, according to BNSF attorney Chad Knight. Local officials also believed the vermiculite was safe, and the railroad couldn\u2019t legally reject the loads, he said. \u201cYou have to go back and look at what the information was at the time,\u201d Knight told jurors during opening statements last week. \u201cThe materials coming from the mine were being used all over town. No one suspected there was anything unsafe about the products.\u201d Knight has also sought to cast doubt on whether the BNSF rail yard was the source of the plaintiffs\u2019 medical problems, since asbestos dust was prevalent in the Libby area when the mine was operating. Tainted vermiculite was used in Libby's high school track, a baseball field next to the rail yard, as a soil amendment in home gardens and as insulating material in homes across the U.S. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys showed jurors several insurance claims for tons of asbestos that leaked out of rail cars in the 1970s and did not make it to its destination, and an example of a placard that was put on a rail car in the late 1970s saying it contained asbestos fibers and to avoid creating dust. Residents of Libby have described encountering vermiculite along BNSF tracks where children in the community often played. When kicked up by wind or a passing trains, asbestos fibers from that vermiculite \u201ccan remain airborne for hours if not days depending on conditions,\u201d said plaintiffs expert Steven Compton, who directs the private laboratory MVA Scientific Consultants in Georgia. Thomas Wells' son Sean Wells described his father during Friday testimony as a \u201cwonderful teacher\u201d and \u201cjust the best dad,\u201d who he could talk to about anything and coached their sports teams. \u201cThere\u2019s not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t think about my dad and wish I could pick up the phone and call him,\u201d Sean Wells said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t only our dad. ... He was our best friend. We did everything together.\u201d Walder died in October 2020 \u2014 less than a month after her diagnosis. She grew up in Libby and could have been exposed to the microscopic, needle-shaped asbestos fibers while fishing and floating on a river that traveled past a spot where a conveyor belt loaded vermiculite onto train cars, according to court records. Additional exposure may have also come from playing around a baseball field near the rail yard, walking along the railroad tracks and spending time at the home of a friend who lived near the rail yard. She also returned to Libby to visit family. After her diagnosis Walder underwent chemotherapy and surgery. In a follow-up appointment Walder's family was told the cancer had come back even worse. \u201cI hope no one has to see the light of hope pass from a parent\u2019s or loved one\u2019s eyes, because that is something you will never forget,\u201d Walder\u2019s daughter, Chandra Zechmeister, testified Monday. ___ Brown reported from Billings, Mont.",

            "title": "Vertex Pharma scientist talks about the long road to developing non-addictive painkillers",
            "date": "2024-04-15 12:00:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- For decades, patients seeking medication for pain have had two choices: over-the-counter drugs like aspirin or powerful prescription opioids like oxycodone. Opioid prescriptions have plummeted over the last decade as doctors have become more attuned to the risks of addiction and misuse during the country\u2019s ongoing drug epidemic. Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently reported positive results for a non-opioid painkiller, one of several medications the Boston-based drugmaker has been developing for various forms of pain. Patients taking the drug after surgery experienced more pain relief than those getting a placebo, although the drug didn\u2019t meet a secondary goal of outperforming treatment with an opioid. The Associated Press spoke with Vertex\u2019s chief scientist Dr. David Altshuler about the company\u2019s research and development plans. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: Why is Vertex interested in new drugs for treating pain? There is a great need for additional medicines to help people manage pain. There are medicines like Tylenol that are modestly effective but they\u2019re very well tolerated. And there\u2019s medicines such as opioids that are very effective but unfortunately have side effects, as well as addictive potential. Identifying additional medicines that could be used for people who need more pain relief but don\u2019t want to take the risks of opioids would be helpful for society. Q: How did you develop these drugs? Vertex has been working on this for 20 years, and the insight that led to the medicines actually came from studies of people who had a rare condition where they are insensitive to pain. They can feel things, sense temperature, but do not feel pain. This was actually identified in a family of fire walkers who could walk on hot coals. So scientists figured out that that condition was due to inherited differences in a particular protein that has a role in pain signaling\u2014 so if you lack this function you don\u2019t feel pain. So we and many others have worked for decades to make a medicine that could recapitulate that naturally-occurring phenomenon. Q: Why wouldn\u2019t these drugs carry the same addictive properties as opioids? Addictive medicines typically work in the brain and they have side effects that aren\u2019t really separable from the reduction in pain, because they\u2019re the same thing. That\u2019s their mechanism of action. In our case, our goal is to make medicines that act in the periphery, not in the brain, so they wouldn\u2019t have the same potential risk. Q: Tell me about the recent data you\u2019ve reported? We\u2019ve reported three studies in people with acute pain \u2014 things like surgery or an injury \u2014 all three studies were positive, all three studies showed substantial reduction of pain of about 50%. One of the secondary endpoints was superiority to the opioid and the drugs were not superior to the opioid that was used for comparison, they were similar in magnitude. But because opioids have so many safety and tolerability issues, a medicine that could have similar efficacy but does not have those challenges might be of interest to people in pain. Q: Are you testing this approach in patients with long-term pain? We also did a study of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which is long-term pain caused when people with diabetes have damaged nerves. That was also a positive study that showed clinically meaningful reduction in pain. So based on that study, a phase 2 study, we\u2019re now planning for a phase 3 study. Q: What comes next? For acute pain we\u2019re preparing to file for FDA approval based on our data. For the longer-term pain, what\u2019s called neuropathic pain, it\u2019s earlier in the development stage but the data is encouraging so far. So we\u2019re continuing studies to determine if it\u2019s possible to apply for approval there.",

            "title": "What does science say about the ingredients in functional beverages?",
            "date": "2024-04-15 06:22:00",
            "content": "Functional beverages \u2014 or drinks promoted as offering mental or physical benefits beyond hydration \u2014 are growing in popularity around the world. Hundreds of companies have jumped into the market, hoping to get some buzz with trendy and sometimes unfamiliar ingredients. Here are some of the latest ones found in functional beverages and what scientists say about them. ADAPTOGENS \u2014 What are they? Plants and mushrooms that may help your body respond to stress, anxiety and fatigue or enhance feelings of well-being. Examples include American and Asian ginseng (an herb), ashwagandha (an evergreen shrub), eleuthero (a shrub), Rhodiola rosea (a flowering plant) and chaga (a mushroom). \u2014 What does the science say? The Cleveland Clinic says adaptogens are known to trigger chemical reactions that can return the body to a more balanced state. Side effects from adaptogens are rare but depend on the plant. Studies show that adaptogens work best for a short duration (less than six months) because the body can build a resistance to them, making them ineffective over time. NOOTROPICS \u2014 What are they? Also known as \u201csmart drugs,\u201d nootropics are substances that can improve human thinking, learning and memory. Among the most common nootropics are caffeine, L-theanine (an amino acid found in tea), creatine (an amino acid naturally found in meat and fish), Bacopa monnieri (an herb), Gingko biloba (a tree) and lion's mane (a mushroom). Some adaptogens may also have nootropic properties, like ashwagandha. \u2014 What does the science say? In a study last year in the journal Plants, researchers said that most plant-based nootropics are not immediately effective after a single dose and must be taken for an extended period before any measurable improvement occurs. One problem in research on these natural substances has been standardizing the form they are taken in and the dosage, the study said. Side effects are rare and usually mild, but users should consider their overall health and whether nootropics could affect any other medications before ingesting them. PROBIOTICS AND PREBIOTICS \u2014 What are they? Probiotics are food s or supplements that contain live microorganisms intended to maintain or improve the \u201cgood\u201d bacteria in a person's gut or other parts of the body. They are naturally found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, cottage cheese, kombucha and sauerkraut. Prebiotics are food for the bacteria and other organisms that live in the gut. Prebiotics can be found in whole grains, bananas, greens, onions, garlic, soybeans and artichokes. \u2014 What does the science say? The Cleveland Clinic says probiotics, in theory, work alongside the beneficial microbes in the human body to fight off harmful bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites. Researchers know that unhealthy microbiomes can contribute to chronic diseases like irritable bowel syndrome. They may also influence mood, pain tolerance and fatigue. The Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic say there is a lot of active research into the microbiome and the impact of probiotics and prebiotics, but not enough evidence to draw solid conclusions about their effectiveness. Side effects are rare except for people with weak immune systems, whose bodies might not be able to fight off a probiotic that inadvertently contains harmful microbes. CBD \u2014 What is it? CBD, or cannabidiol, is an active ingredient in cannabis. While it is one of hundreds of components in marijuana, CBD doesn't cause a high by itself. CBD has been used to treat epilepsy and may also help alleviate anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain and addiction. Side effects could include nausea, fatigue and irritability. \u2014 What does the science say? In an article published in April, Harvard Medical School said CBD appears to be a helpful, relatively non-toxic option for managing anxiety and other issues. But it said more research is needed to pinpoint effective doses.",

            "date": "2017-05-04 06:27:00",
            "content": "&#151; -- An evolving community in the big city of Minneapolis is fighting a dangerous virus -- and a battle of beliefs. The largest measles outbreak in the Minnesota city in 25 years, this April, affected 34 people primarily between the ages of 0 to 5, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. Eleven have been hospitalized. The majority, 29, of the measles cases were among Somali Minnesotans, according to the state health department , which has been working to improve vaccination rates in their community. State and local officials have been searching for any other people exposed to the virus \u2013- potentially 3,000 more -- who may be unvaccinated and vulnerable, to try and stop the spread of the disease. 15-month-old August Goepferd receives the measles, mumps and rubella booster shot at a clinic at Children's Minnesota in Minneapolis, May 2, 2017. August sat on the lap of his mom, Dr. Angela Geopferd, as registered nurse Kim Flaata administered the shot. A measles outbreak in Minnesota has sickened more than 30 children, mostly in the state's large Somali community, which has a low immunization rate. While the overall vaccine compliance rate for Minnesota kindergartners is around 90 percent, it is only about 40 percent in the Somali community, according to Kris Ehresmann, director for infectious disease at the Minnesota Department of Health. \"We've known it's going to be a matter of time before something happens,\" she said about the recent outbreak. In 2011, a similar outbreak occurred in the Somali community in Minnesota after a toddler who had visited Kenya contracted the virus. In that outbreak, 19 children and two adults were infected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health department. A report from the American Academy of Pediatrics found that in the Minneapolis Somali community, the vaccination rate had dropped precipitously from over 90 percent in 2004 to 54 percent in 2010, likely helping that outbreak to spread. Vaccination rates are believed to have dropped over concerns about autism , despite definitive research that refutes a link between vaccines and autism, according to Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and former state epidemiologist . \"Vaccinations have dropped drastically, but autism rates have stayed the same,\" Osterholm said about the sizable Somali population in Minneapolis. Osterholm said that some groups who are skeptical about vaccines have expressed distrust in public health officials trying to stop the outbreak. In addition to other concerns, some have said the vaccinations are unnecessary because the measles outbreaks have ended quickly. Osterholm said the reason is the response and \"thousands of hours\" spent by public health workers to treat the sick and isolate and vaccinate people exposed to the virus. But advocates for limiting or eliminating vaccinations have encouraged the Somali community in Minneapolis to be skeptical. On Sunday, a nonprofit group that has questioned vaccine safety held a meeting for the Somali community to advise them about their rights to decline vaccinations based on their beliefs. Patti Carroll, the director of outreach for the non-profit group called the Vaccine Safety Council of Minnesota, said the goal was to inform parents of their rights and that they could decline recommended vaccinations even during an ongoing measles outbreak. Related Stories Man dies after setting himself on fire near court Apr 20, 9:00 AM Vehicle crashes into building leaving 2 dead Apr 20, 9:20 PM OJ Simpson dies at 76 Apr 11, 6:32 PM \"There is this huge fear-mongering and frenzy of fear over measles without any information over measles vaccine,\" Carroll told ABC News. She said the group is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but that they want to bring up potential vaccines risks. Among the risks she cited is the claim that vaccines are linked to autism, despite numerous academic studies involving millions of children that have found no association between the two. The group's website states their goal is to protect \"people from injuries and deaths from vaccines.\" Mark Blaxill spoke at the meeting on Sunday, aimed at parents in the Somali community, according to ABC affiliate KSTP , and told parents they could refuse vaccinations and still have their children attend daycare and receive benefits. \"The vaccination schedule for children in this country has exploded since 1986,\" Blaxill said, according to KSTP. \"And we simply do not know all of the possible negative side effects of these vaccines as a collective group of immunizations.\" Carroll said about 90 people from the Somali community were at the meeting and the group is planning further outreach. While endemic measles was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, there have been multiple outbreaks of the disease infecting hundreds in states such as Ohio and California, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported . Ehresmann said they believe about 3,000 people have been exposed to the virus and they are trying to reach out to unvaccinated people to offer vaccines or other interventions and give them guidance. \"I think it's fair to say we're expecting to see more cases,\" she told ABC News. The measles virus is one of the most infectious diseases , able to infect 90 percent of unimmunized people who are exposed to it, according to the CDC. Ehresmann said that public health department officials are focused on engaging with the community directly and continuing investigative work to diminish the spread of the outbreak. \"We're not specifically working to counteract specific things that are said because we don't want to add credibility to the argument,\" Ehresmann said about the non-profit's recent meeting. One of the most important messages the community should understand, public health experts say, is that vaccinations are for everyone. \"We vaccinate our own kids and grandkids,\" Osterholm said about people working in public health. \"It's not do as I say it's do as I do.\" The current measles vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC is supported by numerous medical organizations, including the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Academy of Pediatrics.",

            "title": "What patients need to know about new recommendations for prostate cancer screening",
            "date": "2017-04-11 13:09:00",
            "content": "&#151; -- In a decision of concern to many middle-aged men and the doctors who care for them, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF, has changed its recommendation for prostate cancer screening specifically related to the blood test that measures prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which can indicate a growing cancer. Prostate cancer is diagnosed in about 180,000 men every year and leads to roughly 26,000 deaths annually. But many men can live with the disease for years without its causing serious illness. The task force, a panel of experts supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, today is advising men between the ages of 55 and 69 to start a conversation with their doctors about whether to have a PSA test based on each patient\u2019s personal values and priorities. While a PSA test itself isn\u2019t invasive -- it requires drawing blood -- experts are concerned that patients may end up undergoing invasive procedures despite having little chance of developing an aggressive cancer. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what patients should know about the recommendation change. What should patients keep in mind when they go to the doctor? The new guidelines are relatively simple: Men between the ages of 55 to 69 should start a conversation with their doctors about whether to have a PSA test and focus on their own values and priorities. The group continues to recommend against PSA testing for men 70 and older because the harm can outweigh any benefits. What were the previous recommendations? Prostate cancer screening is notoriously rife with uncertainty, and the previous 2012 guidelines advised against PSA testing. This is in part because high levels of PSA often spur more invasive steps. Many men who have high PSA levels undergo a biopsy, which provides vital insight into whether a man has cancer but can\u2019t predict how aggressive it might be. While many prostate cancers cause no problems, men may opt for radiation or surgery, which can cause sexual impotence and/or bowel and bladder problems. The new recommendations may help patients get personalized care to address their health and specific concerns. The guidelines empower patients to talk with their doctor about personalized care tailored to their health and priorities, Dr. Jeff Karnes, a urologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the new recommendations, told ABC News. \u201cA man should be allowed to discuss with his physician whether to have a PSA ordered or not,\u201d Karnes said. Does a high PSA mean you have cancer? Dr. Alex Krist, a member of the USPSTF task force and a family medicine doctor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said a high PSA may not necessarily point to prostate cancer. Other conditions can affect the results. \u201cMany men will have a high PSA at some point in their lives, and most of those will not be prostate cancer but that will be something that the patient and doctor will be worried about\u201d and will evaluate, Krist told ABC News. Additionally, prostate cancer in many patients may not result in dangerous complications. Many people may not even be aware they have the disease. Prostate cancer is so common that one published 2015 study reported more than one-third of white men and one-half of black men ages 70 to 79 were found to have previously undiagnosed prostate cancer on autopsy. Krist said the uncertainty at every step of the way in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer makes it crucial for men to discuss the options, and their concerns, with their doctors. Why did the recommendations change? The new guidance stems from recent evidence of the benefits of screening, and from a movement among prostate specialists toward active surveillance. In this approach, doctors keep a close eye on men with a high risk of prostate cancer, rather than treating outright. \u201cThere is a close balance of benefits and harms,\u201d Krist said, \u201cand that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for men to be involved in making the decision of whether screening is right for them.\u201d Dr. Allison Bond is a resident in internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

            "title": "Report urges fixes to online child exploitation CyberTipline before AI makes it worse",
            "date": "2024-04-22 09:07:00",
            "content": "A tipline set up 26 years ago to combat online child exploitation has not lived up to its potential and needs technological and other improvements to help law enforcement go after abusers and rescue victims, a new report from the Stanford Internet Observatory has found. The fixes to what the researchers describe as an \u201cenormously valuable\u201d service must also come urgently as new artificial intelligence technology threatens to worsen its problems. \u201cAlmost certainly in the years to come, the CyberTipline will just be flooded with highly realistic-looking AI content, which is going to make it even harder for law enforcement to identify real children who need to be rescued,\u201d said researcher Shelby Grossman, an author of the report. The service was established by Congress as the main line of defense for children who are exploited online. By law, tech companies must report any child sexual abuse material they find on their platforms to the system, which is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. After it receives the reports, NCMEC attempts to find the people who sent or received the material \u2014 as well as the victims, if possible. These reports are then sent to law enforcement. While the sheer amount of CyberTipline reports is overwhelming law enforcement, researchers say volume is just one of several problems core to the system. For instance, many of the reports sent by tech companies \u2014 like Google, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 lack important details, such as enough information about an offender's identity, the report said. This makes it hard for law enforcement to know which reports to prioritize. \u201cThere are significant issues with the entire system right now and those cracks are going to become chasms in a world in which AI is generating brand-new CSAM,\u201d said Alex Stamos, using the initials for child sexual abuse materials. Stamos is a Stanford lecturer and cybersecurity expert. The system is behind technologically and plagued by a constant challenge among government and nonprofit tech platforms: the lack of highly skilled engineers, who can get paid far higher salaries in the tech industry. Sometimes those employees are even poached by the same companies that send in the reports. Then there are legal constraints. According to the report, court decisions have led the staff at NCMEC to stop vetting some files (for instance, if they are not publicly available) before sending them to law enforcement. Many law enforcement officials believe they need a search warrant to access such images, slowing down the process. At times, multiple warrants or subpoenas are needed to identify the same offender. It\u2019s also easy for the system to get distracted. The report reveals that NCMEC recently hit a milestone of a million reports in a single day due to a meme that was spreading on multiple platforms -- which some people thought was funny and others were sharing out of outrage. \u201cThat day actually led them to make some changes,\u201d Stamos said. \u201cIt took them weeks to get through that backlog\u201d by making it easier to cluster those images together. The CyberTipline received more than 36 million reports in 2023, nearly all from online platforms. Facebook, Instagram and Google were the companies that sent in the highest number of reports. The overall number has been dramatically increasing. Nearly half of the tips sent last year were actionable, meaning NCMEC and law enforcement could follow up. Hundreds of reports concerned the same offender, and many included multiple images or videos. Around 92% of the reports filed in 2023 involved countries outside the U.S., a large shift from 2008 when the majority involved victims or offenders inside the U.S. Some are false alarms. \u201cIt drives law enforcement nuts when they get these reports that they perceive are definitely adults,\u201d Grossman told reporters. \u201cBut the system incentivizes platforms to be very conservative or to report potentially borderline content, because if it\u2019s found to have been CSAM and they knew about it and they didn\u2019t report it, they could receive fines.\u201d One relatively easy fix proposed in the report would improve how tech platforms label what they are reporting to distinguish between widely shared memes and something that deserves closer investigation. The Stanford researchers interviewed 66 people involved with the CyberTipLine, ranging from law enforcement to NCMEC staff to online platform employees. The NCMEC said it looked forward to \u201cexploring the recommendations internally and with key stakeholders.\u201d \u201cOver the years, the complexity of reports and the severity of the crimes against children continue to evolve. Therefore, leveraging emerging technological solutions into the entire CyberTipline process leads to more children being safeguarded and offenders being held accountable,\u201d it said in a statement. Among the report's other findings: \u2014 The CyberTipline reporting form doesn't have a dedicated field for submitting chat-related material, such as sextortion messaging. The FBI recently warned of a \u201chuge increase\u201d in sextortion cases targeting children \u2014 including financial sextortion, where someone threatens to release compromising images unless the victim pays. \u2014 Police detectives told Stanford researchers they are having a hard time persuading their higher-ups to prioritize these crimes even after they present them with detailed written descriptions to emphasize their gravity. \u201cThey wince when they read it and they don\u2019t really want to think about this,\u201d Grossman said. \u2014 Many law enforcement officials said they were not able to fully investigate all reports due to time and resource constraints. A single detective may be responsible for 2,000 reports a year. \u2014 Outside the U.S., especially in poorer countries, the challenges around child exploitation reports are especially severe. Law enforcement agencies might not have reliable internet connections, \u201cdecent computers\u201d or even gas for cars to execute search warrants. \u2014 Pending legislation passed by the U.S. Senate in December would require online platforms to report child sex trafficking and online enticement to the CyberTipline and give law enforcement more time to investigate child sexual exploitation. Currently, the tipline doesn't offer straightforward ways to report suspected sex trafficking. While some advocates have proposed more intrusive surveillance laws to catch abusers, Stamos, the former chief security officer at Facebook and Yahoo, said they should try simpler fixes first. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to violate the privacy of users if you want to put more pedophiles in jail. They\u2019re sitting right there,\u201d Stamos said. \u201cThe system does not work very well at taking the information that currently exists and then turning it into prosecutions.\u201d",

            "title": "Report urges fixes to online child exploitation CyberTipline before AI makes it worse",
            "date": "2024-04-22 09:07:00",
            "content": "A tipline set up 26 years ago to combat online child exploitation has not lived up to its potential and needs technological and other improvements to help law enforcement go after abusers and rescue victims, a new report from the Stanford Internet Observatory has found. The fixes to what the researchers describe as an \u201cenormously valuable\u201d service must also come urgently as new artificial intelligence technology threatens to worsen its problems. \u201cAlmost certainly in the years to come, the CyberTipline will just be flooded with highly realistic-looking AI content, which is going to make it even harder for law enforcement to identify real children who need to be rescued,\u201d said researcher Shelby Grossman, an author of the report. The service was established by Congress as the main line of defense for children who are exploited online. By law, tech companies must report any child sexual abuse material they find on their platforms to the system, which is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. After it receives the reports, NCMEC attempts to find the people who sent or received the material \u2014 as well as the victims, if possible. These reports are then sent to law enforcement. While the sheer amount of CyberTipline reports is overwhelming law enforcement, researchers say volume is just one of several problems core to the system. For instance, many of the reports sent by tech companies \u2014 like Google, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 lack important details, such as enough information about an offender's identity, the report said. This makes it hard for law enforcement to know which reports to prioritize. \u201cThere are significant issues with the entire system right now and those cracks are going to become chasms in a world in which AI is generating brand-new CSAM,\u201d said Alex Stamos, using the initials for child sexual abuse materials. Stamos is a Stanford lecturer and cybersecurity expert. The system is behind technologically and plagued by a constant challenge among government and nonprofit tech platforms: the lack of highly skilled engineers, who can get paid far higher salaries in the tech industry. Sometimes those employees are even poached by the same companies that send in the reports. Then there are legal constraints. According to the report, court decisions have led the staff at NCMEC to stop vetting some files (for instance, if they are not publicly available) before sending them to law enforcement. Many law enforcement officials believe they need a search warrant to access such images, slowing down the process. At times, multiple warrants or subpoenas are needed to identify the same offender. It\u2019s also easy for the system to get distracted. The report reveals that NCMEC recently hit a milestone of a million reports in a single day due to a meme that was spreading on multiple platforms -- which some people thought was funny and others were sharing out of outrage. \u201cThat day actually led them to make some changes,\u201d Stamos said. \u201cIt took them weeks to get through that backlog\u201d by making it easier to cluster those images together. The CyberTipline received more than 36 million reports in 2023, nearly all from online platforms. Facebook, Instagram and Google were the companies that sent in the highest number of reports. The overall number has been dramatically increasing. Nearly half of the tips sent last year were actionable, meaning NCMEC and law enforcement could follow up. Hundreds of reports concerned the same offender, and many included multiple images or videos. Around 92% of the reports filed in 2023 involved countries outside the U.S., a large shift from 2008 when the majority involved victims or offenders inside the U.S. Some are false alarms. \u201cIt drives law enforcement nuts when they get these reports that they perceive are definitely adults,\u201d Grossman told reporters. \u201cBut the system incentivizes platforms to be very conservative or to report potentially borderline content, because if it\u2019s found to have been CSAM and they knew about it and they didn\u2019t report it, they could receive fines.\u201d One relatively easy fix proposed in the report would improve how tech platforms label what they are reporting to distinguish between widely shared memes and something that deserves closer investigation. The Stanford researchers interviewed 66 people involved with the CyberTipLine, ranging from law enforcement to NCMEC staff to online platform employees. The NCMEC said it looked forward to \u201cexploring the recommendations internally and with key stakeholders.\u201d \u201cOver the years, the complexity of reports and the severity of the crimes against children continue to evolve. Therefore, leveraging emerging technological solutions into the entire CyberTipline process leads to more children being safeguarded and offenders being held accountable,\u201d it said in a statement. Among the report's other findings: \u2014 The CyberTipline reporting form doesn't have a dedicated field for submitting chat-related material, such as sextortion messaging. The FBI recently warned of a \u201chuge increase\u201d in sextortion cases targeting children \u2014 including financial sextortion, where someone threatens to release compromising images unless the victim pays. \u2014 Police detectives told Stanford researchers they are having a hard time persuading their higher-ups to prioritize these crimes even after they present them with detailed written descriptions to emphasize their gravity. \u201cThey wince when they read it and they don\u2019t really want to think about this,\u201d Grossman said. \u2014 Many law enforcement officials said they were not able to fully investigate all reports due to time and resource constraints.

            "date": "2024-04-22 05:05:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program. The grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials. Biden's latest environment al announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Senior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said. Solar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid. But solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans \u2014 and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election -year politics. Forty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Biden is making the announcement at northern Virginia\u2019s Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression. Biden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions. Biden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm. He has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector. Biden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how \"a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,\u201d said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi. He said the programs can \"unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.\u201d The awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion \u201cgreen bank\u201d created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change. EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was \u201clooking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.\u201d Among those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina. The taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank\u2019s funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers. ___ St. John reported from Detroit. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

            "content": "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog said Monday that U.S. search giant Google must fix its advertising search restrictions affecting Yahoo in Japan . The Japan Fair Trade Commission said in a statement that its recent study of Google\u2019s practices showed it was undermining fair competition in the advertising market. Yahoo Japan Corp., which has since merged with the Japanese social media platform Line, began keyword-targeted search advertising services using Google's technology after the two companies formed a tie-up in 2010. The FTC alleges that Google had imposed restrictions in its search advertising agreement with Yahoo Japan that for more than seven years hindered its ability to compete in targeted search ads. An FTC investigation into whether that violated the Anti-Monopoly Law led Google to drop the restrictions. Google said in an emailed statement that it has cooperated fully with the commission's probe, and stressed the commission has not found it had outright violated anti-monopoly laws. It promised to carry out the commission's directives to offer \u201cvaluable\u201d search functions to Japanese users and advertisers. Line Yahoo declined comment. Google will be under review for the next three years, to ensure it carries out needed changes, the commission said. It did not impose any fines or other penalties on Google, which remains popular among Japanese. The commission\u2019s move follows another setback for Google in Japan. Last week, Japanese doctors filed a civil lawsuit against the company, demanding damages for what they claim are groundless derogatory and often false comments. The Tokyo District Court suit demands 1.4 million yen ($9,400) in damages for 63 medical professionals, for reviews posted on Google Maps.

            "date": "2024-04-22 04:28:00",
            "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australia n judge on Monday ruled that social media platform X must block every user in the world from accessing video of a bishop being stabbed in a Sydney church, extending the prohibition beyond users in Australia. X Corp., the tech company rebranded by billionaire Elon Musk when he bought Twitter last year, announced last week it would fight in court Australian orders to take down posts relating to a knife attack on Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel in an Assyrian Orthodox church as a service was being streamed online on April 15. The material was geoblocked from Australia but remained available elsewhere. But the regulator that made the orders, Australia\u2019s eSafety Commission, which describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, successfully applied to the Federal Court in Sydney for a temporary global ban on the sharing of video of the bishop being stabbed. In an after-hours hearing, Justice Geoffrey Kennett suppressed the footage from all X users until Wednesday, when an application for a permanent ban will be heard. X has 24 hours to \u201chide\u201d the footage from users, the judge ruled. The regulator's lawyer, Stephen Tran, had argued that geoblocking Australia did not meet the definition of \u201cremoval\u201d of the footage under Australian law. Tran said the footage was a \u201cgraphic and violent video\u201d that would cause \u201cirreparable harm if it's continuing to circulate.\" X's lawyer Marcus Hoyne said he had been unable to get instructions from his San Francisco-based client because it was early Monday morning in the United States. Musk has described eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant as the \u201cAustralian censorship commissar.\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had earlier criticized X for refusing to remove graphic posts about the knife attack on a bishop and priest at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church. Albanese said social media posts, misinformation and dissemination of violent images had exacerbated suffering from the church attack, which the two clerics survived, as well as a knife attack at a Sydney shopping mall two days earlier which killed six people. \u201cSocial media has a social responsibility,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cI find it extraordinary that X chose not to comply and are trying to argue their case.\u201d The platform\u2019s Global Government Affairs team said on Saturday Inman Grant had ordered it to remove some posts that commented on the church attack, but it said the posts did not violate X\u2019s rules on violent speech. X said the Australian regulator had demanded the platform \u201cglobally withhold these posts or face a daily fine of $785,000.\u201d \u201cX believes that eSafety\u2019s order was not within the scope of Australian law and we complied with the directive pending a legal challenge,\u201d the Global Government Affairs account said. \u201cWhile X respects the right of a country to enforce its laws within its jurisdiction, the eSafety Commissioner does not have the authority to dictate what content X\u2019s users can see globally,\u201d it said. \u201cWe will robustly challenge this unlawful and dangerous approach in court,\u201d it added. The live feed of the church attack and social media posts that followed attracted a crowd of 2,000 people and fueled a riot against police, who barricaded the young suspected attacker inside the place of worship. The rioting injured 51 police officers and damaged 104 police vehicles, officials said. Three alleged rioters had been arrested by Sunday and police on Monday released images of 12 suspects they accuse of being the main instigators of the violence, taken from video of the riot. A 16-year-old boy accused of the stabbings has been charged with terrorism offenses. He has received online condemnation and praise for the attack.",

Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk promised in 2019 that there would be a fleet of robotaxis on the road in 2020, but the promise has yet to materialize, and the system still has to be supervised by humans. The cuts, which occurred on Saturday, follow Tesla's moves to slash $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the United States late Friday. That's the latest evidence of the challenges facing the electric vehicle maker. Tesla reduced the prices of the Model Y, a small SUV which is Tesla\u2019s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the U.S., and also of the Models X and S, its older and more expensive models. Prices for the Model 3 sedan and the Cybertruck stayed the same. The price reduction came the day after Tesla\u2019s stock dropped below $150 per share, wiping out all gains made over the past year. The Austin, Texas, company\u2019s stock price has dropped about 40% so far this year amid falling sales and increased competition.

            "date": "2024-04-20 13:23:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The House passed legislation Saturday that would ban TikTok in the United States if the popular social media platform's China -based owner doesn\u2019t sell its stake within a year, but don't expect the app to go away anytime soon. The decision by House Republicans to include TikTok as part of a larger foreign aid package, a priority for President Joe Biden with broad congressional support for Ukraine and Israel, fast-tracked the ban after an earlier version had stalled in the Senate. A standalone bill with a shorter, six-month selling deadline passed the House in March by an overwhelming bipartisan vote as both Democrats and Republicans voiced national security concerns about the app\u2019s owner, the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. The modified measure, passed by a 360-58 vote, now goes to the Senate after negotiations that lengthened the timeline for the company to sell to nine months, with a possible additional three months if a sale is in progress. Legal challenges could extend that timeline even further. The company has indicated that it would likely go to court to try and block the law if it passes, arguing it would deprive the app\u2019s millions of users of their First Amendment rights. TikTok has lobbied hard against the legislation, pushing the app\u2019s 170 million U.S. users \u2014 many of whom are young \u2014 to call Congress and voice opposition. But the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad concern about Chinese threats to the U.S. and where few members use the platform themselves. \u201cWe will not stop fighting and advocating for you,\u201d TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward the app\u2019s users. \u201cWe will continue to do all we can, including exercising our legal rights, to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you.\u201d The bill\u2019s quick path through Congress is extraordinary because it targets one company and because Congress has taken a hands-off approach to tech regulation for decades. Lawmakers had failed to act despite efforts to protect children online, safeguard users\u2019 privacy and make companies more liable for content posted on their platforms, among other measures. But the TikTok ban reflects widespread concerns from lawmakers about China. Members of both parties, along with intelligence officials, have worried that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over American user data or direct the company to suppress or boost TikTok content favorable to its interests. TikTok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government and has said it has not shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities. The U.S. government has not publicly provided evidence that shows TikTok shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government or tinkered with the company\u2019s popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see. The company has good reason to think a legal challenge could be successful, having seen some success in previous legal fights over its operations in the U.S.. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued. In 2020, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights. His administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. The sale never went through for a number of reasons; one was China, which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Dozens of states and the federal government have put in place TikTok bans on government devices. Texas\u2019 ban was challenged last year by The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which argued in a lawsuit that the policy was impeding academic freedom because it extended to public universities. In December, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have backed the app. \u201cCongress cannot take away the rights of over 170 million Americans who use TikTok to express themselves, engage in political advocacy, and access information from around the world,\u201d said Jenna Leventoff, a lawyer for the group. Since mid-March, TikTok has spent $5 million on TV ads opposing the legislation, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. The ads have included a range of content creators, including a nun, extolling the positive impacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the First Amendment. The company has also encouraged its users to contact Congress, and some lawmakers have received profanity-laced calls. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\u201d said Alex Haurek, a spokesman for the company. California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, voted against the legislation. He said he thinks there could have been less restrictive ways to go after the company that wouldn't result in a total ban or threaten free speech. \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to be well received,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the Beltway being out of touch with where voters are.\u201d Nadya Okamoto, a content creator who has roughly 4 million followers on TikTok, said she has been having conversations with other creators who are experiencing \u201cso much anger and anxiety\u201d about the bill and how it\u2019s going to impact their lives. The 26-year-old, whose company \u201cAugust\u201d sells menstrual products and is known for her advocacy around destigmatizing menstrual periods, makes most of her income from TikTok. \u201cThis is going to have real repercussions,\u201d she said. ___ Hadero reported from New York.",

Kaffa Roastery\u2019s managing director and founder Svante Hampf told The Associated Press on Saturday that the two partners wanted to trial how AI and its different tools could be of help in coffee roasting, a traditional artisan profession highly valued in Finland. \u201cWe basically gave descriptions of all our coffee types and their flavors to AI and instructed it to create a new exciting blend,\u201d said Hampf, while showcasing \u201cAI-conic\u201d at the Helsinki Coffee Festival that annually brings together roasteries and coffee aficionados. In addition to coming up with its chosen mixture of beans from Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia and Guatemala, AI created the coffee package label and a detailed taste description saying \u201cAI-conic\u201d is \u201ca well balanced blend of sweetness and ripe fruit.\u201d Hampf acknowledged he was surprised that AI \u201csomewhat weirdly\u201d chose to make the blend out of four different type of coffee beans, rather than the usual two or three which allows distinction in taste between flavors from different origins. After the first test roasting and blind testing, Kaffa\u2019s coffee experts agreed, however, that the tech-assisted blend was perfect, and there was no need for human adjustments. According to Elev\u2019s spokesman Antti Merilehto \u201cAI-conic is a tangible example of how AI can introduce new perspectives to seasoned professionals\u201d while offering coffee lovers new taste experiences. Kaffa Roastery hopes the trial serves as an opener of dialogue between coffee professionals of things to come in the future in Finland, a nation that has both a strong coffee culture and a passion for technology with a flourishing startup scene. \u201cThis (trial) was the first step in seeing how AI could help us in the future,\u201d Hampf said, adding the project brought smoothly together \u201cthe artisan skills of a roastery\u201d and AI-provided data. \u201cI think AI has plenty to offer us in the long run. We are particularly impressed of the coffee taste descriptions it created.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-20 00:47:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed legislation reauthorizing a key U.S. surveillance law after divisions over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans\u2019 data nearly forced the statute to lapse. Barely missing its midnight deadline, the Senate had approved the bill by a 60-34 vote hours earlier with bipartisan support, extending for two years the program known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Biden thanked congressional leaders for their work. \u201cIn the nick of time, we are reauthorizing FISA right before it expires at midnight,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said when voting on final passage began 15 minutes before the deadline. \u201cAll day long, we persisted and we persisted in trying to reach a breakthrough and in the end, we have succeeded.\u201d U.S. officials have said the surveillance tool, first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since then, is crucial in disrupting terrorist attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. \u201cIf you miss a key piece of intelligence, you may miss some event overseas or put troops in harm\u2019s way,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. \"You may miss a plot to harm the country here, domestically, or somewhere else. So in this particular case, there\u2019s real-life implications.\u201d The proposal would renew the program, which permits the U.S. government to collect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside the country to gather foreign intelligence. The reauthorization faced a long and bumpy road to final passage Friday after months of clashes between privacy advocates and national security hawks pushed consideration of the legislation to the brink of expiration. Though the spy program was technically set to expire at midnight, the Biden administration had said it expected its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications. Still, officials had said that court approval shouldn\u2019t be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse. Hours before the law was set to expire, U.S. officials were already scrambling after two major U.S. communication providers said they would stop complying with orders through the surveillance program, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. Attorney General Merrick Garland praised the reauthorization and reiterated how \u201cindispensable\u201d the tool is to the Justice Department. \u201cThis reauthorization of Section 702 gives the United States the authority to continue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-U.S. persons located outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important reforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of Americans\u2019 privacy and civil liberties,\" Garland said in a statement Saturday. But despite the Biden administration's urging and classified briefings to senators this week on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security, a group of progressive and conservative lawmakers who were agitating for further changes had refused to accept the version of the bill the House sent over last week. The lawmakers had demanded that Schumer, D-N.Y., allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill. In the end, Schumer was able to cut a deal that would allow critics to receive floor votes on their amendments in exchange for speeding up the process for passage. The six amendments ultimately failed to garner the necessary support on the floor to be included in the final passage. One of the major changes detractors had proposed centered around restricting the FBI\u2019s access to information about Americans through the program. Though the surveillance tool only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners. Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, had been pushing a proposal that would require U.S. officials to get a warrant before accessing American communications. \u201cIf the government wants to spy on my private communications or the private communications of any American, they should be required to get approval from a judge, just as our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution,\u201d Durbin said. In the past year, U.S. officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the U.S., including a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. But members on both the House and Senate intelligence committees as well as the Justice Department warned requiring a warrant would severely handicap officials from quickly responding to imminent national security threats. \u201cI think that is a risk that we cannot afford to take with the vast array of challenges our nation faces around the world,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. __ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 17:54:00",
            "content": "MADISON, Wis. -- Lake sturgeon don't need Endangered Species Act protections, federal wildlife officials announced Monday, saying that stocking programs have helped the prehistoric fish return to areas where they had vanished. The decision ends the Arizona-based Center of Biological Diversity's petition filed in May 2018 asking the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list lake sturgeon as endangered or threatened. Such listings would make harvesting the fish illegal, but without them, popular sturgeon harvest seasons in states such as Wisconsin and Michigan can continue. The center argued that overharvesting and deteriorating habitat have \u201cseverely depleted\u201d the species. Dams block access to spawning and rearing habitat and water pollution and diversions have done \u201cirreparable harm,\" the center said. \u201cThis is a disappointing decision because though some populations are well managed, overall the lake sturgeon has suffered a drastic decline,\u201d said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the center. \u201cEndangered Species Act protection would bring a comprehensive recovery plan and ongoing funding to restore these iconic fish across their former range.\u201d Chuck Traxler, the wildlife service\u2019s Midwest deputy regional director, said stocking has helped grow adult lake sturgeon populations and increase spawning, agency officials said. Putting the creatures on the list would be like going to the emergency room, and the rebounding species doesn't need that level of protection, said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean everything is good right now,\u201d he said. \"It means keep up the good work.\u201d Populations aren't at historical highs, the agency acknowledged in a December assessment, but stocking returned them to the Red River of the North between Minnesota and North Dakota, the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, portions of the Mississippi River and the Coosa River. Dam removals and habitat restoration efforts also have helped, the agency has said, citing work in 2015 to retrofit a dam on Wisconsin's Menominee River to allow spawning sturgeon to travel upstream and the removal of the Brecksville Dam on Ohio's Cuyahoga River in 2020. The agency also pointed to reef restoration work in the corridor connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie that has created a place for sturgeon to lay eggs and noted that nine of 43 toxic spots along Great Lakes shorelines have been cleaned up. The assessment also noted the adaptable species should be able to withstand warmer water due to climate change. Lake sturgeon are ancient North American freshwater fish. They're essentially living fossils, first appearing about 136 million years ago when dinosaurs ruled the planet. They resemble torpedoes, with dorsal ridges and snouts. They can grow up to 7 feet (2 meters) long and weigh up to 300 pounds (136 kilograms). Males typically live about 50 years. Females can live anywhere between 80 and 150 years. They're found in the upper and lower Mississippi River basin as well as the Great Lakes. Commercial anglers considered lake sturgeon a nuisance because they tore their nets, leading to widespread over-harvesting in the 1800s that continued into the 20th century. Lake sturgeon can't reproduce fast enough to replace the losses. It takes up to three decades before they reach spawning age, and even then they don't spawn annually. And many don't survive the trip back to their birth waters to spawn. The wildlife service has compared lake sturgeon losses to the mass destruction of the American buffalo. Twenty states have outlawed sturgeon harvesting. Fourteen of those states have listed lake sturgeon as threatened or endangered. Volunteers and Wisconsin natural resources officials have been guarding spawning sturgeon from poachers on the Wolf River for 30 years. Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin still hold hook-and-line lake sturgeon fishing seasons. Michigan and Wisconsin hold sturgeon spearing seasons each winter as well where anglers drill holes through lake ice and impale sturgeon as they swim past. The Wisconsin natural resources department reported 432 sturgeon were taken in February, down from 1,405 in 2023. Warm weather and poor ice conditions led to the diminished return, according to the department. Michigan officials set the total harvest limit at just six sturgeon but ended up canceling due to warm weather and unsafe ice conditions. Those states' seasons are so tightly regulated that the harvests don't impact the species overall, said Lori Nordstrom, the wildlife service\u2019s Midwest assistant regional director of ecological services. Michigan and Wisconsin, for example, allow an angler to take only one sturgeon per year. Minnesota anglers must release any sturgeon they catch in inland waters. Wisconsin regulations are designed to keep the harvest rate below 5%, with all tag fees going to the state's sturgeon conservation program, according to the wildlife service. Leaders of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization that works to rehabilitate sturgeon in Wisconsin and Michigan and supports harvesting the fish, praised the wildlife service's decision Monday. They said the ruling enables the states to continue managing sturgeon and allows harvesting to continue, which in turn helps researchers learn more about the ancient creatures. \"We\u2019re very happy with it,\" said Jim Patt, president of the Southwest Chapter of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, one of five chapters along the Lake Winnebago system, which hosts Wisconsin's spearing season. \"This is a big thing. we can keep our research going and keep our population strong and continue what we\u2019ve been doing.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 17:45:00",
            "content": "LAS VEGAS -- Phish opened its four-night stay at the Sphere Thursday with a four-hour show that used the advanced technology in the $2.3 billion arena to deliver a show that even the band's most ardent fans have never experienced before. \u201cWe came in really wanting to do a show that was a great Phish show,\u201d said Abigail Rosen Holmes, who is running the visual show. She said the band and its creative team wanted to mix the Sphere\u2019s technical capabilities and consider \u201cwhat can we do for Phish that we maybe couldn\u2019t do for any other artist?\u201d Here\u2019s how Phish is creating a set of shows that even fans who\u2019ve seen the band perform hundreds of times won\u2019t have experienced before. While Phish shows usually get their visual punch from lighting guru Chris Kuroda\u2019s massive lighting rig, these shows are completely different as the band uses custom visuals on the 160,000-square foot 16K-by-16K LED screen. Three-dimensional blue bars moving and spinning in time and growing to meet beams of light falling from the ceiling. Live video of the band playing, cut into pieces. A wall of psychedelic-colored cars blinking their lights with a long improvisational jam. Easter eggs from Phish\u2019s history \u2014 like the vacuum cleaner drummer Jon Fishman sometimes plays \u2014 falling from the ceiling. A naturescape that then morphs into a fantasy world. Holmes sits in the center of the arena controlling the visuals in real-time, mixing the elements created with Montreal-based entertainment studio Moment Factory to match the band\u2019s performance. Kuroda sits beside her, using six light towers behind the stage plus spotlights to find the right moments to bring people back to the band on stage. Toward the end of Thursday night\u2019s show, Kuroda started to spotlight individual members of the band, sending a simple black silhouette onto the wall. The silhouette then burst into a reddened field of 20 silhouettes throughout the arena. There are 1,600 permanent speakers, along with 300 mobile speaker modules, that use a 3D audio beamforming and wave field synthesis technology to spread sound throughout the venue. The system allows for individual instruments to be heard from different parts of the arena. \u201cIt\u2019s like pinpoints of sound and thousands and thousands of them,\u201d says Phish\u2019s Trey Anastasio. There are 17,500 seats inside the Sphere, every one of which will be filled with a Phish fan this week, along with about 2,500 standing on the floor. The seats use haptic technology, so every bass line and drum kick from the band can be felt from your chair \u2014 for those actually sitting and not standing up and dancing. U2 performed 40 shows to open the Sphere. Phish sold out its four shows this week within minutes and considered doing more, but decided they wanted to create four unique visual and music experiences to match the band\u2019s history of never repeating the same show twice. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we could have done it any other way,\u201d said Page McConnell, Phish\u2019s piano/organ/keyboard player. \u201cWe do it for us. We do it for the audience. It keeps it interesting for us and it keeps it interesting for them. And it\u2019s what people like about us.\u201d There are 1.2 million LED \u201cpucks\u201d that make up the 580,000-square feet exosphere, each of which can display more than 1 billion colors. The display has become an instant tourist attraction in Las Vegas, seen from hotel rooms around the Strip and from planes above. It cycles through various funky visuals, including a giant yellow blinking smiley face and a furry creature. This week it includes a digital billboard for Phish.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 13:34:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The man who will run United Nations climate talks this November views the negotiations as a key link in international efforts to curb global warming. The conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, must build on last year's successful agreement to transition away from fossil fuels, said Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan's environment minister who will serve as conference president of the talks known as COP29 this fall. And this fall's meeting must help pave the way for countries to come together in 2025 on beefed-up plans to clamp down on heat-trapping gases, Babayev said. Baku is the place to find common ground on how rich countries may provide financial help to poorer nations who generally don't contribute as much to warming but suffer more from climate change, Babayev said in a 30-minute interview with The Associated Press at the Azerbaijan embassy in Washington. \u201cWe need to consider any possible actions or activities to bring the parties to be closer to each other,\u201d Babayev said. \u201cWe consider Baku as a bridge between the developing and developed world.\u201d But it's a bridge under construction. Most past climate negotiations \u2014 called Conferences of the Parties or COPs \u2014 had years to plan. But because of the geopolitics of eastern Europe, world leaders couldn't agree far in advance where COP29 would be. That's critical because the host country holds the presidency and sets the agenda. Baku was chosen last December, with its selection part of the peace accord between warring Armenia and Azerbaijan. Babayev won't officially take charge of negotiations until Nov. 11 when COP29 opens in Baku. Successful climate talks often depend on months or years of work by president-designates such as Babayev traveling and working to forge the skeleton of agreements and alliances. \u201cWe had only 10 months for preparation,\u201d Babayev said. Azerbaijan only recently picked a venue, Baku's large Olympic stadium, to try to fit in the 85,000 or so people who come to these conferences. \u201cA lot of things, they're not clear now but I think within this year everything will be more or less clear.\u201d Babayev said his team is still gathering information, meeting people and making connections, but hasn't yet set specific goals for the conference. But there is one general goal: More financial help for the developing world to shift to cleaner energy systems, and to cope with the extra heat, floods, storms and droughts worsened by climate change. \u201cThe agenda is to invite all the donors to at least increase their contribution for developing countries,\u201d Babayev said. \u201cBecause with the climate change there we are daily faced with all these impacts.\u201d Babayev pointed outside this week to sunny and sticky Washington weather, which was 78 degrees (25.6 degrees Celsius) , or 8 degrees (4.4 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal. He said Baku had similar temperatures at the moment, also well above normal. Look at Dubai, which hosted last year's climate talks, and its devastating flooding this week, something Kazakhstan and other countries have also felt, he said. Babayev pointed to early February in Baku when it hit a record 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit), which smashed the old February high mark by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit: \u201cThat is not normal. It is not normal.\u201d Babayev, 56, was in Washington for the spring meetings of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other powerful financial institutions. He and his team were mostly gathering information. The United Nations climate secretary, Simon Stiell, last week called on those financial institutions to make dramatic changes, including debt relief for poor nations, to help fight warming and its impacts. But Babayev is eyeing another group: The private sector of banks, investments funds and the like. \u201cWe call on the private sector to be very active and responsible about this and to be ready to not delay with the offers, the proposals for climate finance,\u201d Babayev said. Like the current COP president, Sultan al-Jaber of Dubai, who is the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Babayev worked for many years in the state-owned oil company in Azerbaijan. Activists and academics have long blasted the influence of the oil industry \u2014 one of the major sources of heat-trapping gases \u2014 in these United Nations negotiations and that intensified last year when it was run by an oil man. But al Jaber and Babayev said their industry connections are more helpful in getting companies to the table and getting things done. Babayev said he also hopes that Baku \u2014 where the world's first oil fields were developed in 1846 and Azerbaijan led the world in oil production in 1899 \u2014 can show how this \u201coil and gas country of the past\u201d can show the world a green path with its efforts to ramp up renewable energy, especially wind power. But in the past 10 years, Azerbaijan has increased its emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels by 13%, according to data from scientists at the Global Carbon Project. ___ Read more of AP\u2019s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "content": "HONG KONG -- Apple said it had removed Meta\u2019s WhatsApp messaging app and its Threads social media app from the App Store in China to comply with orders from Chinese authorities. The apps were removed from the store on Friday after Chinese officials cited unspecified national security concerns. Their removal comes amid elevated tensions between the U.S. and China over trade, technology and national security. The U.S. has threatened to ban TikTok over national security concerns. But while TikTok, owned by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, is used by millions in the U.S., apps like WhatsApp and Threads are not commonly used in China. Instead, the messaging app WeChat, owned by Chinese company Tencent, reigns supreme. Other Meta apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger remained available for download, although use of such foreign apps is blocked in China due to its \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d network of filters that restrict use of foreign websites such as Google and Facebook. \u201cThe Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,\u201d Apple said. A spokesman for Meta referred to \u201cApple for comment.\u201d Apple, previously the world\u2019s top smartphone maker, recently lost the top spot to Korean rival Samsung Electronics. The U.S. firm has run into headwinds in China, one of its top three markets, with sales slumping after Chinese government agencies and employees of state-owned companies were ordered not to bring Apple devices to work. Apple has been diversifying its manufacturing bases outside China. Its CEO Tim Cook has been visiting Southeast Asia this week, traveling to Hanoi and Jakarta before wrapping up his travels in Singapore. On Friday he met with Singapore\u2019s deputy prime minister, Lawrence Wong, where they \u201cdiscussed the partnership between Singapore and Apple, and Apple\u2019s continued commitment to doing business in Singapore.\u201d Apple pledged to invest over $250 million to expand its campus in the city-state. Earlier this week, Cook met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, pledging to increase spending on Vietnamese suppliers. He also met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Cook later told reporters that they talked about Widodo's desire to promote manufacturing in Indonesia, and said that this was something that Apple would \u201clook at\".",

            "date": "2024-04-19 07:54:00",
            "content": "LONDON -- Olympic organizers unveiled their strategy Friday to use artificial intelligence in sports, joining the global rush to capitalize on the rapidly advancing technology. The International Olympic Committee outlined its agenda for taking advantage of AI. Officials said it could be used to help identify promising athletes, personalize training methods and make the games fairer by improving judging. \u201cToday we are making another step to ensure the uniqueness of the Olympic Games and the relevance of sport. To do this, we have to be leaders of change,\u201d IOC President Thomas Bach said at a press event in the velodrome at the Olympic Park in London, which hosted the summer games in 2012. \"We are determined to exploit the vast potential of AI in a responsible way,\u201d Bach said. The IOC revealed its AI master plan as it gears up to hold the Paris Olympics, which are set to kick off in just under 100 days. The IOC's AI plans also include using the technology to protect athletes from online harassment and to help broadcasters improve the viewing experience for people watching from home. The IOC earns billions of dollars through the sale of broadcast rights for the games. Some AI projects will be rolled out at the Paris games and the IOC has set up a working group on the technology to further drive its adoption in sport, Bach said, without being more specific. The local organizers of the Paris games have sparked controversy with their plans to use artificial intelligence for security, with a video surveillance system that includes AI-powered cameras to flag potential security risks such as abandoned packages or crowd surges. Digital watchdog groups fear that a proposal to legalize smart surveillance systems, even if only temporarily, will infringe on privacy, though the French government insists the systems won't use facial recognition technology. Asked about the concerns, Bach told reporters it's up to the authorities in the host country, not the IOC, to decide on \u201dthe best tools to apply to secure the games.\" \u201cWhat we have seen from the French government and from the authorities is that the efforts to ensure security in Paris are really, on a very wide scope, very professional. So we have all confidence in the French authorities,\u201d he said. Skier Lindsey Vonn said she was envious of the AI-powered tools that weren't available when she was starting out. Vonn said back in the day she took notes by hand in her performance diary on how different skis, boots and the temperature affected her performance. Nowadays, tablets are used to instantly crunch much more data, as well as give a side-by-side video comparison of the best racing line. AI can supercharge those analytical tools, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not replacing athletes, it\u2019s not replacing coaching. But I think it\u2019s just another tool that can be used in a positive way to perform better,\u201d Vonn said. The IOC has partnered with Intel to scout out potential athletes in overlooked places. The tech company took its equipment to Senegal, where they visited five villages and analyzed the athletic ability of a thousand children, by measuring how high they could jump and how fast they could react. Using AI to analyze the results, \"we found 40 that are really promising,\" said Christoph Schell, Intel's chief commercial officer. The shortlisted kids' results were then run through an algorithm that recommended what sports they'd be good at, he said. Olympic officials are also aware of AI risks. Bach warned against allowing machines to be the ultimate arbiter of a young athlete's career. Someone who's a \u201cgreat athlete in wrestling must still have the chance to play tennis and cannot be sorted out\u201d by the algorithms, he said. ___ AP videojournalist Kwiyeon Ha contributed to this report.",

            "content": "ISLAMABAD -- An important ally of Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif demanded the government lift a two-month-old ban on the social media platform X, saying on Friday that it violates citizens' right to speech and expression. The ban on X has been in place since February, when the party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan announced a nationwide protest against alleged election rigging ahead of the Feb. 8 vote that allowed Sharif to come to power. \u201cWe demand that the ban on X, which is known as Twitter , should immediately be lifted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to stop any further violation of human rights,\u201d said Farhatullah Babar, a senior leader of the Pakistan People's Party. The PPP is an important member of the coalition that allowed Sharif to form a government in March. Babar is known as a defender of human rights who's taken stands on civil rights and the protection of minorities during a three-decade career in politics. Sharif's government offered conflicting justifications for the ban in public statements before telling an Islamabad court that the decision to impose it had been made \u201cin the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order and preserving the integrity of the nation.\u201d Another court in Karachi asked the government to reverse the ban on Wednesday after petitions from human rights defenders. Millions of people use X in Pakistan, and Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party relies on it especially heavily. The PTI says the restrictions were meant to suppress its voice on social media. Many people have been using VPN software to bypass the government's block on X, and access to the platform has been intermittently restored, but human rights activists want a total end to the ban. Babar made his comments a day after X said that it was in contact with Pakistan to understand its concerns. Pakistan has said the social media is being used to defame the country\u2019s institutions, a phrase which is often used to refer to the military and judiciary. Both have come under criticism from Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in April 2022. Babar said there was a perception that such institutions were behind the ban. \u201cThere are certain powerful forces in Pakistan, and you know there is a perception here that these forces are sitting in the driving seat and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is in the back seat, and we request the prime minister to dispel this impression by lifting the ban on X with whatever power he has now,\u201d Babar told the Associated Press Washington has also urged Pakistan to lift restrictions on X.",

            "content": "TOKYO -- A group of Japan ese doctors has filed a civil lawsuit against U.S. search giant Google, demanding damages for what they claim are unpoliced derogatory and often false comments. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Tokyo District Court, demands 1.4 million yen ($9,400) in damages for 63 medical professionals. Google said in an emailed statement Friday that it is working \u201c24 hours a day\u201d to reduce misleading or false information on its platform, combining human and technological resources \u201cto delete fraudulent reviews.\u201d The lawsuit claims groundless negative reviews have been posted on Google Maps, a very popular app in Japan, that allows people to write in ratings of various institutions and their personal reviews. Some comments are irresponsible and appear to be written out of spite and the \u201cword of mouth\u201d remarks take on a life of their own and are nearly impossible to refute, according to the lawsuit. It said Google has done very little to fix the problem, despite complaints. \u201cThe damage suffered is substantial, and the people have been powerless to fight back. We don\u2019t agree that the platform shares no responsibility,\u201d Yuichi Nakazawa, who leads the legal team for the plaintiffs, told reporters. Some Japanese say they rely on what people say online about hospitals, including how long the wait was or what kind of care they got, rather than official sites. But those online comments may be inaccurate and even detrimental to health care , those behind the lawsuit say. Japan boasts a relatively widespread and affordable health care system, making the medical sector a hot topic in one of the fastest aging societies in the world. Class actions are relatively rare in Japan, though Google has been sued in the U.S. and various other nations, accused of misleading advertising, violations of privacy and other problems. Earlier this month, Google agreed to purge billions of records containing personal information collected from more than 136 million people in the U.S. who had surfed the internet through its Chrome web browser. That was part of a settlement in a U.S. lawsuit that had accused Google of illegal surveillance. The lawsuit in Japan is intended to highlight the potential dangers from Google's technology, the lawyers for the medical professionals say.

            "date": "2024-04-18 21:59:00",
            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google will combine the software division responsible for Android mobile software and the Chrome browser with the hardware division known for Pixel smartphones and Fitbit wearables, the company said Thursday. It's part of a broader plan to integrate artificial intelligence more widely throughout the company. In a letter to employees, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the changes will \u201cturbocharge the Android and Chrome ecosystems\u201d while helping to spur innovation. The decision will place both operations under the oversight of Rick Osterloh, a Google executive who previously oversaw the company's hardware group. Not long ago, Google insulated Android development from the hardware division, saying it wanted to avoid giving its phone designers an unfair advantage over the other major smartphone makers who used Android \u2014 including Samsung and Motorola, as well as Chinese companies such as Oppo and Xiaomi. Then a few years ago, Google started to position the Pixel as a flagship for demonstrating what AI could accomplish and leaned heavily into developing features that could demonstrate its potential. That meant more integration of AI hardware and software to power those features on mobile devices. In an interview with The Verge, a tech publication, Osterloh noted that AI is the primary reason for bringing together Google's consumer hardware and software engineers. He argued that phone technology is already growing more dependent on AI, citing the development of the Pixel camera, which among other things uses the technology for features that enhance nighttime photos or automatically choose the best of several closely timed shots. Combining the teams, Osterloh added, is a way for Google to move even faster on infusing AI into its features. Designing the Pixel camera several years ago, he said in the interview, required deep knowledge of not just the complex hardware and software systems involved, but also the then-early AI models used for image processing. \u201cThat hardware-software-AI integration really showed how AI could totally transform a user experience,\u201d Osterloh said. \u201cThat was important. And it\u2019s even more true today.\u201d \u201cWhat you\u2019re now starting to see Google do is flex its core AI innovation engines,\u201d said Chirag Dekate, an analyst with Gartner. \u201cGoogle wants to dominate the AI, the commanding heights of the emerging AI economy, both on the consumer side as well as on the enterprise side, essentially by infusing AI everywhere and by connecting it.\u201d Meanwhile, the chief of Google's software division, Hiroshi Lockheimer, is left without a title and, according to Pichai's letter, will be starting some other unnamed projects. Lockheimer did join Osterloh for the Verge interview, though, and the two men insisted the changes weren't the result of a power struggle. Google is also reorganizing its AI research and responsibility groups, although those changes mostly won\u2019t directly affect consumer products \u2014 at least not for now.",

            "date": "2024-04-18 19:22:00",
            "content": "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A U.S. congressional committee released confidential Brazilian court orders to suspend accounts on the social media platform X, offering a glimpse into decisions that have spurred complaints of alleged censorship from the company and its billionaire owner Elon Musk . The Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee late Wednesday published a staff report disclosing dozens of decisions by Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordering X to suspend or remove around 150 user profiles from its platform in recent years. The 541-page report is the product of committee subpoenas directed at X. In his orders, de Moraes had prohibited X from making them public. \u201cTo comply with its obligations under U.S. law, X Corp. has responded to the Committee,\u201d the company said in a statement on X on April 15. The disclosure comes amid a battle Musk has waged against de Moraes. Musk, a self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist, had vowed to publish de Moraes\u2019 orders, which he equated to censorship. His crusade has been cheered on by supporters of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro, who allege they are being targeted by political persecution, and have found common cause with their ideological allies in the U.S. De Moraes has overseen a five-year probe of so-called \u201cdigital militias,\u201d who allegedly spread defamatory fake news and threats to Supreme Court justices. The investigation expanded to include those inciting demonstrations across the country, seeking to overturn Bolsonaro\u2019s 2022 election loss. Those protests culminated in the Jan. 8 uprising in Brazil\u2019s capital, with Bolsonaro supporters storming government buildings, including the Supreme Court, in an attempt to oust President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from office. De Moraes\u2019 critics claim he has abused his powers and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to unilaterally ban social media accounts, including those of democratically elected legislators. But most legal experts see his brash tactics as legally sound and furthermore justified by extraordinary circumstances of democracy imperiled. They note his decisions have been either upheld by his fellow justices or gone unchallenged. The secret orders disclosed by the congressional committee had been issued both by Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court and its top electoral court, over which de Moraes currently presides. The press office of the Supreme Court declined to comment on the potential ramifications of their release when contacted by The Associated Press. \u201cMusk is indeed a very innovative businessman; he innovated with electric cars, he innovated with rockets and now he invented a new form of non-compliance of a court order, through an intermediary,\u201d said Carlos Affonso, director of the nonprofit Institute of Technology and Society. \u201cHe said he would reveal the documents and he found someone to do this for him.\u201d Affonso, also a professor of civil rights at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said that the orders are legal but do merit debate, given users were not informed why their accounts were suspended and whether the action was taken by the platform or at the behest of a court. The orders to X included in the report rarely provide justification, either. The Supreme Court's press office said in a statement Thursday afternoon that the orders do not contain justifications, but said the company and people with suspended accounts can gain access by requesting the decisions from the court. While Musk has repeatedly decried de Moraes\u2019 orders as suppressing \u201cfree speech\u201d principles and amounting to \u201caggressive censorship,\u201d the company under his ownership has bowed to government requests from around the world. Last year, for instance, X blocked posts critical of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and, in February, it blocked accounts and posts in India at the behest of the country\u2019s government. \u201cThe Indian government has issued executive orders requiring X to act on specific accounts and posts, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment,\u201d X's global affairs account posted on Feb. 21. \u201cIn compliance with the orders, we will withhold these accounts and posts in India alone; however, we disagree with these actions and maintain that freedom of expression should extend to these posts.\u201d Brazil is a key market for X and other social media platforms. About 40 million Brazilians, or about 18% of the population, access X at least once per month, according to market research group eMarketer. X has followed suspension orders under threat of hefty fines. De Moraes typically required compliance within two hours, and established a daily fine of 100,000-reais ($20,000) for noncompliance. It isn\u2019t clear whether the 150 suspended accounts represent the entirety of those de Moraes ordered suspended. Until the committee report, it wasn\u2019t known whether the total was a handful, a few dozen or more. Some of the suspended accounts in the report have since been reactivated. On April 6, Musk took to X to challenge de Moraes, questioning why he was \u201cdemanding so much censorship in Brazil\u201d. The following day, the tech mogul said he would cease to comply with court orders to block accounts \u2014 and that de Moraes should either resign or be impeached. Predicting that X could be shut down in Brazil, he instructed Brazilians to use a VPN to retain their access. De Moraes swiftly included Musk in the ongoing investigation of digital militias, and launched a separate investigation into whether Musk engaged in obstruction, criminal organization and incitement. On April 13, X's legal representative in Brazil wrote to de Moraes that it will comply with all court orders, according to the letter, seen by the AP. Affonso said the committee\u2019s release of de Moraes\u2019 orders were aimed less at Brazil than at the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. The report cites Brazil \u201cas a stark warning to Americans about the threats posed by government censorship here at home.\u201d Terms like \u201ccensorship\u201d and \u201cfree speech\u201d have turned into political rallying cries for U.S. conservatives since at least the 2016 presidential election, frustrated at seeing right-leaning commentators and high-profile Republican officials booted off Facebook and Twitter in its pre-Musk version for violating rules. \u201cThe reason why the far-right needs him (Musk) is because they need a platform, they need a place to promote themselves. And Elon Musk needs far-right politicians because they will keep his platform protected from regulations,\u201d said David Nemer, a Brazil native and University of Virginia professor who studies social media. In the U.S., free speech is a constitutional right that\u2019s much more permissive than in other countries, including Brazil. Still, the report's release seemed to invigorate Bolsonaro and his far-right supporters. Late Wednesday, soon after the court orders were released, Bolsonaro capped off a speech at a public event by calling for a round of applause for Musk. His audience eagerly complied. ___ AP writer Barbara Ortutay contributed from San Francisco ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

He did not immediately respond to phone calls from The Associated Press seeking comment. \u201cThe incident was quickly addressed and resolved,\u201d Sanchez said in a statement, according to KAMC-TV. \u201cThe city\u2019s water disinfectant system was not affected, and the public water system nor the public was in any danger.\u201d At least one of the attacks was linked this week by Mandiant, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, to a shadowy Russian hacktivist group that it said could be working with or part of a Russian military hacking unit. The group, calling itself CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn, claimed responsibility for January attacks on water facilities in the United States and Poland that got little attention at the time. Cybersecurity researchers say CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn was among groups suspected of Russian government ties that engaged last year in low-complexity attacks against Ukraine and its allies, including denial-of-service data barrages that temporarily knock websites offline. Sometimes such groups claim responsibility for attacks that were actually carried out by Kremlin military intelligence hackers, Microsoft reported in December. Cypert, the Hale Center city manager, said he has turned information over to FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The FBI declined to comment, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a branch of DHS, referred questions to the cities that were targeted. In Lockney, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Hale Center and home to around 1,500 people, cyberattackers were thwarted before they could access that town\u2019s water system, city manager Buster Poling said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t cause any problems except being a nuisance,\u201d Poling said. Last year CISA put out an advisory following November hacks on U.S. water facilities attributed to Iranian state groups who said they were targeting facilities using Israeli equipment. Deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger said in December that attacks by Iranian hackers \u2014 as well as a separate spate of ransomware attacks on the health care industry \u2014 should be seen as a call to action by utilities and industry to tighten cybersecurity. In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael S. Regan and Jake Sullivan, assistant to the president for National Security Affairs, sent a letter to the nation\u2019s governors asking them to take steps to protect the water supply, including assessing cybersecurity and planning for a cyberattack. \u201cDrinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous cybersecurity practices,\u201d Regan and Sullivan wrote. ___ AP Technology Writer Frank Bajak contributed to this report.",

            "title": "Bitcoin's latest 'halving' has arrived. Here's what you need to know",
            "date": "2024-04-18 17:04:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- The \u201cminers\u201d who chisel bitcoins out of complex mathematics are taking a 50% pay cut \u2014 effectively reducing new production of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, again. Bitcoin's latest \u201chalving\" occurred Friday night. Soon after the highly anticipated event, the price of bitcoin held steady at about $63,907. Now, all eyes are on what will happen down the road. Beyond bitcoin\u2019s long-term price behavior, which relies heavily on other market conditions, experts point to potential impacts on the day-to-day operations of the asset\u2019s miners themselves. But, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Bitcoin \u201chalving,\u201d a preprogrammed event that occurs roughly every four years, impacts the production of bitcoin. Miners use farms of noisy, specialized computers to solve convoluted math puzzles; and when they complete one, they get a fixed number of bitcoins as a reward. Halving does exactly what it sounds like \u2014 it cuts that fixed income in half. And when the mining reward falls, so does the number of new bitcoins entering the market. That means the supply of coins available to satisfy demand grows more slowly. Limited supply is one of bitcoin\u2019s key features. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, and more than 19.5 million of them have already been mined, leaving fewer than 1.5 million left to pull from. So long as demand remains the same or climbs faster than supply, bitcoin prices should rise as halving limits output. Because of this, some argue that bitcoin can counteract inflation \u2014 still, experts stress that future gains are never guaranteed. Per bitcoin\u2019s code, halving occurs after the creation of every 210,000 \u201cblocks\u201d \u2014 where transactions are recorded \u2014 during the mining process. No calendar dates are set in stone, but that divvies out to roughly once every four years. Only time will tell. Following each of the three previous halvings, the price of bitcoin was mixed in the first few months and wound up significantly higher one year later. But as investors well know, past performance is not an indicator of future results. \u201cI don\u2019t know how significant we can say halving is just yet,\u201d said Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko. \u201cThe sample size of three (previous halvings) isn\u2019t big enough to say \u2018It\u2019s going to go up 500% again,\u2019 or something.\u201d At the time of the last halving in May 2020, for example, bitcoin\u2019s price stood at around $8,602, according to CoinMarketCap \u2014 and climbed almost seven-fold to nearly $56,705 by May 2021. Bitcoin prices nearly quadrupled a year after July 2016\u2019s halving and shot up by almost 80 times one year out from bitcoin\u2019s first halving in November 2012. Experts like McCarthy stress that other bullish market conditions contributed to those returns. Friday's halving also arrives after a year of steep increases for bitcoin. As of Friday night, bitcoin\u2019s price stood at $63,907 per CoinMarketCap. That\u2019s down from the all-time-high of about $73,750 hit last month, but still double the asset\u2019s price from a year ago. Much of the credit for bitcoin\u2019s recent rally is given to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset \u2014 spot bitcoin ETFs, which were only approved by U.S. regulators in January. A research report from crypto fund manager Bitwise found that these spot ETFs, short for exchange-traded funds, saw $12.1 billion in inflows during the first quarter. Bitwise senior crypto research analyst Ryan Rasmussen said persistent or growing ETF demand, when paired with the \u201csupply shock\u201d resulting from the coming halving, could help propel bitcoin\u2019s price further. \u201cWe would expect the price of Bitcoin to have a strong performance over the next 12 months,\u201d he said. Rasmussen notes that he\u2019s seen some predict gains reaching as high as $400,000, but the more \u201cconsensus estimate\u201d is closer to the $100,000-$175,000 range. Other experts stress caution, pointing to the possibility the gains have already been realized. In a Wednesday research note, JPMorgan analysts maintained that they don\u2019t expect to see post-halving price increases because the event \u201chas already been already priced in\u201d \u2014 noting that the market is still in overbought conditions per their analysis of bitcoin futures. Miners, meanwhile, will be challenged with compensating for the reduction in rewards while also keeping operating costs down. \u201cEven if there\u2019s a slight increase in bitcoin price, (halving) can really impact a miner\u2019s ability to pay bills,\u201d Andrew W. Balthazor, a Miami-based attorney who specializes in digital assets at Holland & Knight, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t assume that bitcoin is just going to go to the moon. As your business model, you have to plan for extreme volatility.\u201d Better-prepared miners have likely laid the groundwork ahead of time, perhaps by increasing energy efficiency or raising new capital. But cracks may arise for less-efficient, struggling firms. One likely outcome: Consolidation. That\u2019s become increasingly common in the bitcoin mining industry, particularly following a major crypto crash in 2022. In its recent research report, Bitwise found that total miner revenue slumped one month after each of the three previous halvings. But those figures had rebounded significantly after a full year \u2014 thanks to spikes in the price of bitcoin as well as larger miners expanding their operations. Time will tell how mining companies fare following this latest halving. But Rasmussen is betting that big players will continue to expand and utilize the industry\u2019s technology advances to make operations more efficient. Pinpointing definitive data on the environmental impacts directly tied to bitcoin halving is still a bit of a question mark. But it\u2019s no secret that crypto mining consumes a lot of energy overall \u2014 and operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years. Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to emissions of burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%). Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that pushes towards the use of more clean energy have increased in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world. Production pressures could result in miners looking to cut costs. Ahead of the latest halving, JPMorgan cautioned that some bitcoin mining firms may \u201clook to diversify into low energy cost regions\u201d to deploy inefficient mining rigs.",

            "title": "First major attempts to regulate AI face headwinds from all sides",
            "date": "2024-04-18 16:46:00",
            "content": "DENVER -- Artificial intelligence is helping decide which Americans get the job interview, the apartment, even medical care, but the first major proposals to reign in bias in AI decision making are facing headwinds from every direction. Lawmakers working on these bills, in states including Colorado, Connecticut and Texas, came together Thursday to argue the case for their proposals as civil rights-oriented groups and the industry play tug-of-war with core components of the legislation. \u201cEvery bill we run is going to end the world as we know it. That\u2019s a common thread you hear when you run policies,\u201d Colorado\u2019s Democratic Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re here with a policy that\u2019s not been done anywhere to the extent that we\u2019ve done it, and it\u2019s a glass ceiling we\u2019re breaking trying to do good policy.\u201d Organizations including labor unions and consumer advocacy groups are pulling for more transparency from companies and greater legal recourse for citizens to sue over AI discrimination. The industry is offering tentative support but digging in its heels over those accountability measures. The group of bipartisan lawmakers caught in the middle \u2014 including those from Alaska, Georgia and Virginia \u2014 has been working on AI legislation together in the face of federal inaction. On Thursday, they highlighted their work across states and stakeholders, emphasizing the need for AI legislation and reinforcing the importance for collaboration and compromise to avoid regulatory inconsistencies across state lines. They also argued the bills are a first step that can be built on going forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a new frontier and in a way, a bit of a wild, wild West,\u201d Alaska\u2019s Republican Sen. Shelley Hughes said at the news conference. \u201cBut it is a good reminder that legislation that passed, it\u2019s not in stone, it can be tweaked over time.\u201d While over 400 AI-related bills are being debated this year in statehouses nationwide, most target one industry or just a piece of the technology \u2014 such as deepfakes used in elections or to make pornographic images. The biggest bills this team of lawmakers has put forward offer a broad framework for oversight, particularly around one of the technology's most perverse dilemmas: AI discrimination. Examples include an AI that failed to accurately assess Black medical patients and another that downgraded women\u2019s resumes as it filtered job applications. Still, up to 83% of employers use algorithms to help in hiring, according to estimates from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. If nothing is done, there will almost always be bias in these AI systems, explained Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a Brown University computer and data science professor who\u2019s teaching a class on mitigating bias in the design of these algorithms. \u201cYou have to do something explicit to not be biased in the first place,\u201d he said. These proposals, mainly in Colorado and Connecticut, are complex, but the core thrust is that companies would be required to perform \u201cimpact assessments\" for AI systems that play a large role in making decisions for those in the U.S. Those reports would include descriptions of how AI figures into a decision, the data collected and an analysis of the risks of discrimination, along with an explanation of the company\u2019s safeguards. Requiring greater access to information on the AI systems means more accountability and safety for the public. But companies worry it also raises the risk of lawsuits and the revelation of trade secrets. David Edmonson, of TechNet, a bipartisan network of technology CEOs and senior executives that lobbies on AI bills, said in a statement that the organization works with lawmakers to \u201censure any legislation addresses AI\u2019s risk while allowing innovation to flourish.\u201d Under bills in Colorado and Connecticut, companies that use AI wouldn\u2019t have to routinely submit impact assessments to the government. Instead, they would be required to disclose to the attorney general if they found discrimination \u2014 a government or independent organization wouldn't be testing these AI systems for bias. Labor unions and academics worry that over reliance on companies self-reporting imperils the public or government's ability to catch AI discrimination before it's done harm. \u201cIt\u2019s already hard when you have these huge companies with billions of dollars,\u201d said Kjersten Forseth, who represents the Colorado's AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions that opposes Colorado's bill. \u201cEssentially you are giving them an extra boot to push down on a worker or consumer.\u201d The California Chamber of Commerce opposes that state's bill, concerned that impact assessments could be made public in litigation. Another contentious component of the bills is who can file a lawsuit under the legislation, which the bills generally limit to state attorney generals and other public attorneys \u2014 not citizens. After a provision in California's bill that allowed citizens to sue was stripped out, Workday, a finance and HR software company, endorsed the proposal. Workday argues that civil actions from citizens would leave the decisions up to judges, many of whom are not tech experts, and could result in an inconsistent approach to regulation. Sorelle Friedler, a professor who focuses on AI bias at Haverford College, pushes back. \u201cThat\u2019s generally how American society asserts our rights, is by suing,\u201d said Friedler. Connecticut\u2019s Democratic state Sen. James Maroney said there\u2019s been pushback in articles that claim he and Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Texas, have been \u201cpedaling industry-written bills\u201d despite all of the money being spent by the industry to lobby against the legislation. Maroney pointed out one industry group, Consumer Technology Association, has taken out ads and built a website, urging lawmakers to defeat the legislation. \u201cI believe that we are on the right path. We\u2019ve worked together with people from industry, from academia, from civil society,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants to feel safe, and we\u2019re creating regulations that will allow for safe and trustworthy AI,\" he added. _____ Associated Press reporters Tr\u00e2n Nguy\u1ec5n contributed from Sacramento, California, Becky Bohrer contributed from Juneau, Alaska, Susan Haigh contributed from Hartford, Connecticut. ___ Bedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

            "title": "Netflix now has nearly 270 million subscribers after another strong showing to begin 2024",
            "date": "2024-04-18 16:43:00",
            "content": "Netflix gained another 9.3 million subscribers to start the year while its profit soared with the help of a still-emerging expansion into advertising, but caught investors off guard with a change that will make it more difficult to track the video streaming service's future growth. The performance announced Thursday demonstrated that Netflix is still building on its momentum of last year, when a crackdown on free-loading viewers relying on shared passwords and the rollout of a low-priced option including commercials revived its growth following a post-pandemic lull. The strategy resulted in Netflix adding 30 million subscribers last year \u2014 the second largest annual increase the service\u2019s history. Netflix\u2019s gains during the January-March period more than quadrupled the 1.8 million subscribers that the video streaming service added at the same time last year, and was nearly three times more than analysts had projected. The Los Gatos, California, company ended March with nearly 270 million worldwide subscribers, including about 83 million in its biggest market covering the U.S. and Canada. Investors increasingly are viewing Netflix as the clear-cut winner in a fierce streaming battle that includes Apple, Amazon , Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros. Discovery \u2014 a conclusion has caused its stock price to more than double since the end of 2022. But Netflix surprised investors by disclosing in a shareholder letter that it will stop providing quarterly updates about its subscriber totals beginning next year, a move that will make it more difficult to track the video streaming service's growth \u2014 or contraction. The company has regularly posted its quarterly subscriber totals since going public 22 years ago. Netflix's shares dipped more than 5% in extended trading, despite the strong financial showing. In a video meeting with analysts, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said management believes the company's financial growth has become more meaningful to watch than quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in subscribers. \u201cWe think this is a better approach that reflects the evolution of the business,\u201d Peters said. The company still intends to give annual updates on total subscribers. That plan indicates Netflix is trying to get investors focus on long-term trends rather than three-month increments that can be affected by short-term factors such as programming changes and household budgetary pressures that cause temporary cancellations, said Raj Venkatesan, a business administration professor at the University of Virginia who studies the video streaming market. Now that Netflix has been cracking down on password sharing for more than a year, management also likely realizes it has reaped most of the subscriber gains from those measures and recognizes it will be more difficult to maintain that momentum, eMarketer analyst Ross Benes said. \u201cThey are quitting while they are ahead by no longer reporting quarterly subscriber numbers,\u201d Benes said. Netflix's renewed subscriber growth has been coupled with a sharper focus on boosting profit and revenue \u2014 an emphasis that has led management to be more judicious about its spending on original programming and regularly raising its subscription prices. It\u2019s a formula that helped Netflix earn $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, in the most recent quarter, a 79% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 15% from a year ago to $9.37 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had projected earnings of $4.52 per share on revenue of $9.27 billion. Advertising sales still play a small role in Netflix\u2019s finances, with BMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Pitz projecting the company will bring in about $1.5 billion from commercials streamed on its service this year, while foreseeing years of steady growth ahead. The low-priced option with ads is having a big impact on bringing in and retaining subscribers, according to Pitz, who expects 41 million customers paying for the commercial format.",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- Shares of Ibotta, a Walmart-backed digital company that offers customers cash-back rewards and rebates on grocery brands ranging from Nestle to Coca-Cola, rose 17% in their Wall Street debut. The stock, which trades under the ticker \u201cIBTA\" on the New York Stock Exchange, opened Thursday at $117, well above the $88 offering price. By mid-afternoon trading, it had lost some momentum and closed at $103.25, giving it a market value of more than $3 billion. Ibotta joins a handful of tech companies like Instacart and Reddit that enjoyed a solid debut in the public markets. Last September, grocery delivery Instacart\u2019s shares finished the day up 12.3% on Nasdaq, giving the company a market value of more than $11 billion. Reddit\u2019s stock soared in its Wall Street debut in March of this year as investors pushed the value of the company close to $9 billion seconds after it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Denver-based Ibotta, founded by lawyer Bryan Leach in 2011, works with more than 850 different clients and represents 2,400 consumer packaged brands, according to its prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Walmart, Family Dollar, Kroger and other major retailers use its artificial intelligence -enabled software, which delivers promotions that match customers' purchasing behavior. Ibotta said it only gets paid when a customer sees a company's promotion and it results in a sale. Those customers get cash back every time they buy something in a participating brand's store or on their app, with the money deposited in their bank account or applied to a gift card. Ibotta said in its filing that it's given more than $1.8 billion back to customers since 2012. It reported net income of $38 million on sales of $320 million last year. That compared with a net loss of $55 million on revenue of $211 million in 2022, according to the prospectus. Walmart is listed among the company's stockholders with a 5% or greater share. Ibotta sold 2.5 million shares. It plans to use net proceeds \u2014 which it estimated at $198 million assuming an IPO price of $88 \u2014 for general corporate purposes including working capital and capital expenditures. Selling shareholders are offering another 4.1 million shares, but Ibotta won't receive proceeds from those sales. The company has two classes of stock with Leach, who is also president and CEO, getting roughly 70% of the combined voting power of its stock.",

            "date": "2024-04-18 13:05:00",
            "content": "Tesla's stock tumbled below $150 per share, giving up all of the gains made over the past year as the electric vehicle maker reels from falling sales and steep discounts intended to lure more buyers. Shares in the Elon Musk -owned company slid nearly 4% in intraday trading Thursday, in what now stands as the third worst week for the stock in 2024, a year that has been dismal for Tesla investors. The Austin, Texas company's shares are down 12.4% this week and more than 39% this year. Shares of Tesla Inc. last traded at the $150 level in January 2023. It's also been a bad year for employees. Tesla said Monday that it was cutting 10% of its staff globally, about 14,000 jobs. The next day, Tesla announced it would try to re-instate Musk's $56 billion pay package that was rejected by a Delaware judge in January, who said that the arrangement was dictated by Musk and was the product of sham negotiations with directors who were not independent of him. At the time of the Delaware court ruling, Musk\u2019s package was worth more than $55.8 billion, but the stock slide has cut that to $44.9 billion at the close of trading on Friday, according to a company filing this week. Tesla shares hit an all-time intraday high of $415.50 in November of 2021, adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split that took effect in August 2022. Tesla sales fell sharply last quarter as competition increased worldwide, electric vehicle sales growth slowed, and price cuts failed to draw more buyers. The company said it delivered 386,810 vehicles from January through March, nearly 9% below the 423,000 it sold in the same quarter of last year. Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush who has been very bullish on Tesla\u2019s stock, called the first quarter sales numbers an \u201cunmitigated disaster.\" \u201cFor Musk, this is a fork in the road time to get Tesla through this turbulent period otherwise dark days could be ahead,\u201d Ives wrote this week. Yet on Thursday, Deutsche Bank joined other industry analysts in voicing concern over Musk's big bet on autonomous vehicles as it stripped the company of its \u201cbuy\u201d rating, citing Tesla\u2019s \u201cchange of strategic priority to Robotaxi.\u201d Wall Street expects that Tesla will report a decline in first quarter earnings next week and many are wondering if there\u2019s any near-term catalyst for growth that would end Tesla\u2019s stock slide. Industry analysts were expecting a new small electric vehicle for the masses that would cost around $25,000, the Model 2, but there were reports last week that Musk was scrapping that project. Musk disputed the reports, but wrote on X, the social media platform that he owns, that Tesla would unveil a robotaxi at an event on Aug. 8. Uncertainty over the release of a cheaper vehicle from Tesla has altered the equation for analysts like Deutche Bank's Emmanuel Rosner. Such a delay would tie Tesla's future more closely to \u201ccracking the code on full driverless autonomy, which represents a significant technological, regulatory and operational challenge. We view Tesla\u2019s shift as thesis-changing,\u201d Rosner wrote. Since last year, Tesla has cut prices as much as $20,000 on some models as it faced increasing competition and slowing demand. Other automakers also have had to cut electric vehicle production and reduce prices to move EVs off dealership lots. Ford, for instance, cut production of the F-150 Lightning electric pickup, and lopped up to $8,100 off the price of the Mustang Mach E electric SUV in order to sell 2023 models. U.S. electric vehicle sales growth slowed to 3.3% in the first quarter of the year, far below the 47% increase that fueled record sales and a 7.6% market share last year. Sales of new vehicles overall grew 5.1%, and the EV market share declined to 7.15%. In addition to massive job cuts this week, Tesla this week announced the departure of two high-placed executives. Andrew Baglino, Tesla\u2019s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, is leaving after 18 years with the company. Rohan Patel, senior global director of public policy and business development and eight-year Tesla veteran, is also departing.",

Leila Pakkala, director of UNICEF\u2019s supply division, said in a statement that the agency will be able to boost supplies by more than 25%. Gavi estimated there could be about 50 million doses for the global stockpile this year, compared with 38 million last year. Dr. Derrick Sim of Gavi called WHO\u2019s authorization \u201ca lifeline for vulnerable communities around the world.\u201d More is still needed, however: Since January, 14 countries affected by cholera outbreaks have requested 79 million doses. In January, the U.N. agency said the global vaccine stockpile was \u201centirely depleted\u201d until the beginning of March. As of this week, WHO said there were 2.3 million doses available. Cholera is an acute diarrhea disease caused by a bacteria typically spread via contaminated food or water. It is mostly seen in areas that have poor sanitation and lack access to clean water. While most people infected with cholera don't experience symptoms, those with severe cases need quick treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. If left untreated, cholera kills about a quarter to half of people infected. Since last January, WHO has reported more than 824,000 cholera infections, including 5,900 deaths worldwide, with the highest numbers of cases reported in the Middle East and Africa. The U.N. agency said warming temperatures that allow the cholera bacteria to live longer, have also worsened outbreaks and led to the highest death rates in a decade. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

            "date": "2024-04-18 12:30:00",
            "content": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Facebook parent Meta Platforms unveiled a new set of artificial intelligence systems Thursday that are powering what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls \u201cthe most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\u201d But as Zuckerberg's crew of amped-up Meta AI agents started venturing into social media this week to engage with real people, their bizarre exchanges exposed the ongoing limitations of even the best generative AI technology. One joined a Facebook moms\u2019 group to talk about its gifted child. Another tried to give away nonexistent items to confused members of a Buy Nothing forum. Meta, along with leading AI developers Google and OpenAI, and startups such as Anthropic, Cohere and France\u2019s Mistral, have been churning out new AI language models and hoping to persuade customers they've got the smartest, handiest or most efficient chatbots. While Meta is saving the most powerful of its AI models, called Llama 3, for later, on Thursday it publicly released two smaller versions of the same Llama 3 system and said it's now baked into the Meta AI assistant feature in Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. AI language models are trained on vast pools of data that help them predict the most plausible next word in a sentence, with newer versions typically smarter and more capable than their predecessors. Meta's newest models were built with 8 billion and 70 billion parameters \u2014 a measurement of how much data the system is trained on. A bigger, roughly 400 billion-parameter model is still in training. \u201cThe vast majority of consumers don\u2019t candidly know or care too much about the underlying base model, but the way they will experience it is just as a much more useful, fun and versatile AI assistant,\u201d said Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, in an interview. He added that Meta\u2019s AI agent is loosening up. Some people found the earlier Llama 2 model \u2014 released less than a year ago \u2014 to be \u201ca little stiff and sanctimonious sometimes in not responding to what were often perfectly innocuous or innocent prompts and questions,\u201d he said. But in letting down their guard, Meta's AI agents also were spotted this week posing as humans with made-up life experiences. An official Meta AI chatbot inserted itself into a conversation in a private Facebook group for Manhattan moms, claiming that it, too, had a child in the New York City school district. Confronted by group members, it later apologized before the comments disappeared, according to a series of screenshots shown to The Associated Press. \u201cApologies for the mistake! I'm just a large language model, I don't have experiences or children,\u201d the chatbot told the group. One group member who also happens to study AI said it was clear that the agent didn't know how to differentiate a helpful response from one that would be seen as insensitive, disrespectful or meaningless when generated by AI rather than a human. \u201cAn AI assistant that is not reliably helpful and can be actively harmful puts a lot of the burden on the individuals using it,\u201d said Aleksandra Korolova, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton University. Clegg said Wednesday he wasn't aware of the exchange. Facebook's online help page says the Meta AI agent will join a group conversation if invited, or if someone \u201casks a question in a post and no one responds within an hour.\u201d The group's administrators have the ability to turn it off. In another example shown to the AP on Thursday, the agent caused confusion in a forum for swapping unwanted items near Boston. Exactly one hour after a Facebook user posted about looking for certain items, an AI agent offered a \u201cgently used\u201d Canon camera and an \u201calmost-new portable air conditioning unit that I never ended up using.\u201d Meta said in a written statement Thursday that \u201cthis is new technology and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems.\u201d The company said it is constantly working to improve the features. In the year after ChatGPT sparked a frenzy for AI technology that generates human-like writing, images, code and sound, the tech industry and academia introduced some 149 large AI systems trained on massive datasets, more than double the year before, according to a Stanford University survey. They may eventually hit a limit \u2014 at least when it comes to data, said Nestor Maslej, a research manager for Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. \u201cI think it\u2019s been clear that if you scale the models on more data, they can become increasingly better,\" he said. \"But at the same time, these systems are already trained on percentages of all the data that has ever existed on the internet.\u201d More data \u2014 acquired and ingested at costs only tech giants can afford, and increasingly subject to copyright disputes and lawsuits \u2014 will continue to drive improvements. \u201cYet they still cannot plan well,\u201d Maslej said. \"They still hallucinate. They\u2019re still making mistakes in reasoning.\u201d Getting to AI systems that can perform higher-level cognitive tasks and commonsense reasoning \u2014 where humans still excel\u2014 might require a shift beyond building ever-bigger models. For the flood of businesses trying to adopt generative AI, which model they choose depends on several factors, including cost. Language models, in particular, have been used to power customer service chatbots, write reports and financial insights and summarize long documents. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing companies kind of looking at fit, testing each of the different models for what they\u2019re trying to do and finding some that are better at some areas rather than others,\u201d said Todd Lohr, a leader in technology consulting at KPMG. Unlike other model developers selling their AI services to other businesses, Meta is largely designing its AI products for consumers \u2014 those using its advertising-fueled social networks. Joelle Pineau, Meta\u2019s vice president of AI research, said at a London event last week the company's goal over time is to make a Llama-powered Meta AI \"the most useful assistant in the world.\u201d \u201cIn many ways, the models that we have today are going to be child\u2019s play compared to the models coming in five years,\u201d she said. But she said the \u201cquestion on the table\u201d is whether researchers have been able to fine tune its bigger Llama 3 model so that it\u2019s safe to use and doesn\u2019t, for example, hallucinate or engage in hate speech. In contrast to leading proprietary systems from Google and OpenAI, Meta has so far advocated for a more open approach, publicly releasing key components of its AI systems for others to use. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a technical question,\" Pineau said. \"It is a social question. What is the behavior that we want out of these models? How do we shape that? And if we keep on growing our model ever more in general and powerful without properly socializing them, we are going to have a big problem on our hands.\u201d ___ AP business writers Kelvin Chan in London and Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, California, contributed to this report.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON -- A ancient giant snake in India might have been longer than a school bus and weighed a ton, researchers reported Thursday. Fossils found near a coal mine revealed a snake that stretched an estimated 36 feet (11 meters) to 50 feet (15 meters). It's comparable to the largest known snake at about 42 feet (13 meters) that once lived in what is now Colombia. The largest living snake today is Asia's reticulated python at 33 feet (10 meters). The newly discovered behemoth lived 47 million years ago in western India\u2019s swampy evergreen forests. It could have weighed up to 2,200 pounds (1,000 kilograms), researchers said in the journal Scientific Reports. They gave it the name Vasuki indicus after \u201cthe mythical snake king Vasuki, who wraps around the neck of the Hindu deity Shiva,\u201d said Debajit Datta, a study co-author at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. This monster snake wasn\u2019t especially swift to strike. \u201cConsidering its large size, Vasuki was a slow-moving ambush predator that would subdue its prey through constriction,\u201d Datta said in an email. Fragments of the snake's backbone were discovered in 2005 by co-author Sunil Bajpai, based at the same institute, near Kutch, Gujarat, in western India. The researchers compared more than 20 fossil vertebrae to skeletons of living snakes to estimate size. While it's not clear exactly what Vasuki ate, other fossils found nearby reveal that the snake lived in swampy areas alongside catfish, turtles, crocodiles and primitive whales, which may have been its prey, Datta said. The other extinct giant snake, Titanoboa, was discovered in Colombia and is estimated to have lived around 60 million years ago. What these two monster snakes have in common is that they lived during periods of exceptionally warm global climates, said Jason Head, a Cambridge University paleontologist who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese snakes are giant cold-blooded animals,\" he said. \"A snake requires higher temperatures\u201d to grow into large sizes. So does that mean that global warming will bring back monster-sized snakes? In theory, it's possible. But the climate is now warming too quickly for snakes to evolve again to be giants, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "date": "2024-04-18 09:29:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The Lyrid meteor shower is underway. But with a nearly full moon in the sky during the peak, it might be tough to see clearly. The Lyrids occur every year in mid-to-late April. This year's peak activity happens Sunday into Monday, with 10 to 20 meteors expected per hour. Viewing lasts through April 29. Here's what to know about the Lyrids and other meteor showers. Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don\u2019t need special equipment to see them. Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets. The source of the Lyrids is the comet Thatcher. When rocks from space enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky. Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours, and don\u2019t require special equipment. Just look up. It\u2019s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest. \u201cLook to the northeast and just keep staring at the same spot in the sky\" to see the Lyrids, said University of Warwick astronomer Don Pollacco. \u201dIt's always impressive when you see these things.\" The clearest sighting for the Lyrids is in the Northern Hemisphere, but moonlight will interfere with viewing, according to the American Meteor Society. Under ideal conditions, \"the meteors often appear very bright with bluish trails and often the trails seem to hang around for a few seconds in the sky,\" said Pollacco. The meteor society keeps an updated list of upcoming large meteor showers, including the peak viewing days and moonlight conditions. The Eta Aquarids meteor shower peaks in early May with best viewing in the Southern Hemisphere. The shower is caused by debris from Halley's comet. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

            "date": "2024-04-18 09:17:00",
            "content": "Google has fired 28 employees in the aftermath of protests over technology that the internet company is supplying the Israeli government amid the Gaza war, further escalating tensions surrounding a hot-button deal. The firings confirmed by Google late Wednesday came a day after nine employees were arrested during sit-in protests at offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California, after the company called police. The dissent roiling Google centers on \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 that calls upon Google and Amazon to provide the Israeli government with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services. The protests are being organized primarily by a group called No Tech For Apartheid. Google says Nimbus isn't being deployed in weaponry or intelligence gathering. In a statement, Google attributed the firing of the 28 employees to \u201ccompletely unacceptable behavior\u201d that prevented some workers from doing their jobs and created a threatening atmosphere. The Mountain View, California, company added it is still investigating what happened during the protests, implying more workers could still be fired. In a blog post, No Tech For Apartheid accused Google of lying about what happened inside its offices during what it described as \u201cpeaceful sit-in\" that received overwhelming support from other workers who weren't participating in the protest. \u201cThis flagrant act of retaliation is a clear indication that Google values its $1.2 billion contract with the genocidal Israeli government and military more than its own workers,\u201d No Tech For Apartheid asserted. Without calling out a specific incident, Google CEO Sundar Pichai indicated in a Thursday blog post that employees will be on a short leash as the company intensifies its efforts to improve its AI technology at a pivotal moment in the industry and, potentially, humanity. \u201cThis is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics,\u201d Pichai wrote. \u201cThis is too important a moment as a company for us to be distracted.\u201d The contract raising the ire of some Google workers runs within the company's cloud computing division that is overseen by a former Oracle executive, Thomas Kurian. Under Kurian's leadership, cloud computing has emerged as one of Google's fastest-growing divisions, with revenue of $33 billion last year, a 26% increase from 2022. A wide range of private-sector companies also buy Google's cloud computing services, in addition to governments around the world. Google workers have periodically staged angry protests over other deals the company has been working on and have also raised ethical concerns about the way it is developing artificial intelligence. One of the previous employee uprisings resulted in Google deciding in 2018 to end a contract with the U.S. defense department called \u201cProject Maven\u201d that involved helping the armed forces analyze military videos. But Google has continued to thrive, despite the internal misgivings about the way it is making some of its money. Its revenue mostly comes through digital advertising sold through an internet empire that depends on its dominant search engine as its main pillar. Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., posted a $74 billion profit last year and now employs about 182,000 workers worldwide \u2014 about 83,000 more people than in 2018 when it abandoned Project Maven.",

            "content": "HELSINKI -- Wireless and fixed-network equipment maker Nokia on Thursday reported a smaller-than-expected profit and a double-digit fall in sales in the first quarter due to a market weakened by a lack of clients investing in 5G technology. The Espoo, Finland-based company reported a net profit of 501 million euros ($535 million) for the January-March period, up 46% from 342 million euros a year earlier. The figure was still lower than analysts had expected. One-off gains from Nokia\u2019s licensing business contributed to the profit. Net income attributable to shareholders was 497 million euros, up from from 332 million euros a year earlier. Nokia\u2019s sales were down 20% at 4.7 billion euros. The ongoing weakness in the telecom equipment market, where operators are cutting back on investments into 5G and other technology because of economic uncertainty and high financing costs, prevailed in the first quarter \u201cas expected,\u201d Nokia\u2019s CEO Pekka Lundmark said. \u201cHowever, we have seen continued improvement in order intake, meaning we remain confident in a stronger second half and achieving our full-year outlook,\u201d Lundmark said in a statement.

Mount Ruang on the northern side of Sulawesi Island had at least five large eruptions Wednesday, causing the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation to issue its highest-level alert, indicating an active eruption. The crater emitted white-gray smoke continuously during the day Thursday, reaching more than 500 meters (1,600 feet) above the peak. People have been ordered to stay at least 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from the 725-meter (2,378 foot) mountain. More than 11,000 people live in the affected area and were told to leave. At least 800 have done so. An international airport in Manado city was temporarily closed Thursday as volcanic ash was spewed into the air. \u201cWe have to close flight operations at Sam Ratulangi Airport due to the spread of volcanic ash, which could endanger flight safety,\u201d said Ambar Suryoko, head of the regional airport authority. Eruptions Wednesday evening spewed volcanic ash approximately 70,000 feet into the atmosphere, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre. The bureau said in a statement Thursday it was tracking and forecasting the ash dispersion. Indonesia's volcanology center noted the risks from the volcanic eruption include the possibility that part of the volcano could collapse into the sea and cause a tsunami. In December 2018, Indonesia\u2019s Anak Krakatau volcano island erupted and collapsed, losing around 3/4 its volume and triggering a powerful tsunami that killed more than 400 people. An 1871 eruption at Mount Ruang also triggered a tsunami. Tagulandang Island, east of the Ruang volcano, could be at risk if a collapse occurred. Its residents were among those being told to evacuate. \u201cPeople who live in the Tagulandang Island area and are within a 6-kilometer radius must be immediately evacuated to a safe place outside the 6-kilometer radius,\" Abdul Muhari, spokesperson of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said Thursday. \u201cAnd especially those who live near the coast should be aware of the potential for incandescent rocks to erupt, hot clouds and tsunami waves that could be triggered by the collapse of a volcanic body into the sea.\u201d The agency said residents will be relocated to Manado, the nearest city, on Sulawesi island \u2014 a six-hour journey by boat.

            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration has reached an agreement to provide $6.1 billion in government support for Micron Technology to produce advanced memory computer chips in New York and Idaho. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., personally courted Micron to build what would ultimately be a set of four chip factories near Syracuse in the town of Clay. He noted in a Wednesday interview that the announcement was a sign to voters about how Democrats were reviving the manufacturing sector. \u201dIt will be the biggest memory chip plant in America,\u201d said Schumer. \u201cFor the Syracuse area, this is the best thing that\u2019s happened probably since the Erie Canal.\u201d The comparison to the 1825 infrastructure project that connected the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean is audacious, but it gets at the possible magnitude of the economic impact as well as the national security stakes in an increasingly digital world. Including the government support, Micron plans to invest $100 billion in upstate New York over the next two decades. The investment would lead to an estimated 9,000 direct jobs and 40,000 construction jobs. Micron has also announced plans for a $15 billion memory chip plant in its hometown of Boise, Idaho. The funding comes from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which is set to provide government support for new and expanded facilities being developed by Intel, TSMC, Samsung and Global Foundries, among other chip companies. The law included $52 billion to support the domestic semiconductor industry, reducing the risk that the chip shortages experienced amid the pandemic could hurt the U.S. economy and national security. The Democratic administration has set a goal for 20% of the world\u2019s advanced chips to be made in the United States and has restricted the flow of chips into China . A senior Biden administration official, insisting on anonymity to discuss the deal before its official announcement, confirmed the agreement with Micron. President Joe Biden discussed in Pittsburgh on Wednesday the importance of computer chips that power everything from weapons to artificial intelligence to household appliances such as refrigerators. Biden noted that Republican Donald Trump , the former president and his election -year rival, had not been as aggressive in boosting the sector and curbing China's access to chips. \u201cFor all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that,\u201d Biden told a group of steelworkers. Trump has told his supporters that China was \u201cafraid\u201d of him because he levied tariffs on the nation with the goal of supporting U.S. factory jobs. Biden has kept the tariffs and on Wednesday suggested plans to expand them on steel and aluminum. \u201cI took on communist China like no administration in history,\u201d Trump told supporters at a Saturday rally in Pennsylvania.",

            "content": "With cloud seeding, it may rain, but it doesn't really pour or flood \u2014 at least nothing like what drenched the United Arab Emirates and paralyzed Dubai, meteorologists said. Cloud seeding, although decades old, is still controversial in the weather community, mostly because it has been hard to prove that it does very much. No one reports the type of flooding that on Tuesday doused the UAE, which often deploys the technology in an attempt to squeeze every drop of moisture from a sky that usually gives less than 4 or 5 inches (10 to 13 centimeters) of rain a year. \u201cIt's most certainly not cloud seeding,\u201d said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, former chief scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cIf that occurred with cloud seeding, they'd have water all the time. You can't create rain out of thin air per se and get 6 inches of water. That's akin to perpetual motion technology.\u201d Meteorologists and climate scientists said the extreme rainfall is akin to what the world expects with human-caused climate change, and one way to know for certain that it was not caused by tinkering with clouds is that it was forecast days in advance. Atmospheric science researcher Tomer Burg pointed to computer models that six days earlier forecast several inches of rain \u2014 the typical amount for an entire year in the UAE. Three low-pressure systems formed a train of storms slowly moving along the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems \u2014 toward the Persian Gulf, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. Blaming cloud seeding ignores the forecasts and the cause, he said. Many of the people pointing to cloud seeding are also climate change deniers who are trying to divert attention from what's really happening, Mann and other scientists said. \u201cWhen we talk about heavy rainfall, we need to talk about climate change. Focusing on cloud seeding is misleading,\u201d said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads a team that does rapid attribution of weather extremes to see if they were caused by global warming or not. \u201cRainfall is becoming much heavier around the world as the climate warms because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture.\" Clouds need tiny water or ice droplets called nuclei to make rain. The weather modification method uses planes and ground-based cannons to shoot particles into clouds making more nucleai, attracting moisture that falls as snow and rain. Usually silver iodide is used, but it can also be dry ice and other materials. The method, first pioneered in the 1940s, became popular in the U.S. West starting in the 1960s, mostly for snow. It can\u2019t create water from a clear sky \u2014 particles must be shot into a storm cloud that already holds moisture to get it to fall, or to fall more than it otherwise would naturally. A recent study of aerial seeding found a clear precipitation pattern on a radar that mirrored the seeding and offers evidence the method works. But exactly how effective it is remains unclear, scientists say. The physics makes sense, but the results have been so small that scientists just can't agree on whether it is fair to say it really works, said Maue and Mann. Atmospheric forces are so huge and so chaotic that technically cloud seeding \u201cis way too small a scale to create what happened,\u201d Maue said. Extra rainfall from cloud seeding would have been minimal, both said. Despite not knowing its efficacy, governments in drought-stricken regions like the U.S. West and the UAE are often willing to invest in technology like seeding in the hopes of getting even a small amount of water. Utah estimates cloud seeding helped increase its water supply by 12% in 2018, according to an analysis by the state's Division of Water Resources. The analysis used estimates provided to them by the contractors paid to do the seeding. Dozens of countries in Asia and the Middle East also use cloud seeding. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spent $2.4 million last year on cloud seeding along the overtapped Colorado River. Utah recently increased its seeding budget by tenfold. That part of the Middle East doesn't get many storms, but when it does, they are whoppers that dwarf what people in the United States are used to, Maue said. Huge tropical storms like this \u201care not rare events for the Middle East,\u201d said University of Reading meteorology professor Suzanne Gray. She cited a recent study analyzing nearly 100 such events over the southern Arabian Peninsula from 2000 to 2020, with most in March and April, including a March 2016 storm that dropped 9.4 inches (almost 24 centimeters) on Dubai in just a few hours. The 2021 study said \u201ca statistically significant increase in the (whopper storms) duration over southeast Arabian Peninsula has been found, suggesting that such extreme events may be even more impactful in a warming world.\u201d While cloud seeding can work around the margins, it doesn't do big things, scientists say. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe a little bit of a human conceit that, yeah, we can control the weather in like a Star Trek sense,\u201d Maue, who was appointed to NOAA by then-President Donald Trump, said. \"Maybe on long time scales, climate time scales, we\u2019re affecting the atmosphere on long time scales. But when it comes to controlling individual rain storms, we are not anywhere close to that. And if we were capable of doing that, I think we would be capable of solving many more difficult problems than creating a rain shower over Dubai.\" ___ Borenstein reported from Washington, Peterson from Boulder, Colorado. ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

            "title": "After 40 nights of U2 at the Sphere, Phish's Trey Anastasio talks about taking over",
            "date": "2024-04-17 15:25:00",
            "content": "LAS VEGAS -- Phish has been performing for decades, but never has the band played the same show twice. Over the 40 years since the band was formed at a Vermont college, Phish has amassed a reputation for its dedicated legion of fans and the dazzling light shows that accompany the improvisational jams. It follows, then, that the next stop for Phish is the new temple of immersive performances: the Sphere in Las Vegas. Inaugurated with U2's 40-show residency, the $2.3 billion arena will offer Phish fans something they've definitely never seen \u2014 or felt \u2014 before. Mind-blowing visuals run up, down and across the floor-to-ceiling screen, designed to be manipulated in real-time during the band\u2019s long jams. A sound system features more than 1,600 speakers, allowing for a Trey Anastasio guitar line in one spot and a line from Page McConnell\u2019s keys in another. Seats make you feel like you\u2019re inside every drum kick from Jon Fishman or bass bomb from Mike Gordon. Starting Thursday, Phish will play four shows, with new visuals each night \u2014 and no repeated songs, of course. Anastasio, the band's frontman, says fans will be able to discern a theme across the shows \u2026 and find lots of Easter eggs. The shows will be the first to be livestreamed from the Sphere as well on LivePhish.com. \u201cI love getting up in the morning and creatively thinking of another cool thing to blow people\u2019s minds,\u201d Anastasio says. Anastasio talked to The Associated Press this week about the teamwork that goes into these shows, how their \u201cgiant rolling family\u201d of fans keeps them going and whether there will ever be another Gamehendge. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. ANASTASIO: It\u2019s extremely unique to any venue that we\u2019ve played before. One of the things that we\u2019ve tried to do is sculpt our show so that we can be the band that we always are and play to our strengths while simultaneously using the technology to kind of expand the elements of the show \u2014 like the adventure and the breaking free of boundaries. ANASTASIO: Constantly. Daily. Yesterday. We dropped some things yesterday. It\u2019s a constant process of waking up in the morning and looking for areas that we can improve. Everyone on the team is incredible, but the level of communication and proactive teamwork is hard to describe. And that\u2019s what it takes to get something like this mounted. But yeah, there were ideas on what the thematic narrative that was going to run through the four nights that went on for a month. Then we landed on one. Then it was what songs we\u2019re going to play, what the (visual) content was going to be, how literal we wanted to make it. The answer to that is not very literal. Our fans are really smart and really involved, and we wanted to take a night or so for people to figure out what we were doing, plant a lot of Easter eggs and things like that. But it\u2019s a never-ending daily improvement. ANASTASIO: We\u2019re a very different band. We\u2019ve never repeated a set and we didn\u2019t want to start now. So we created four unique Sphere shows, top to bottom. There was a moment where we were discussing adding shows, because the tickets blew out pretty hard. And we decided as a team that they would be good, but not necessarily astounding \u2014 which is the level that we wanted to operate at \u2014 unless we just repeated the exact same show over again. The other thing is that Phish is such a wacky community that it kind of set up this scenario where a lot of people would probably want to come back. It\u2019s just the way our fans are. It\u2019s kind of like a big, giant rolling family or community or something like that. ANASTASIO: Always. Always. I just love the feeling of being part of a group, working on something creative, especially when it\u2019s firing on all cylinders and people communicate well. It\u2019s been one of the great joys of my life. That\u2019s what a band is. A good band is a family. It\u2019s a team. It\u2019s communication and listening and it\u2019s hard to describe what a joy it is when you spend almost a year working on \u2014 like what we did last year (with a New Year\u2019s Eve performance of the band\u2019s epic set of \u201cGamehendge\u201d songs, complete with stage actors and puppets). It\u2019s like you feel like you\u2019re alive. And the Sphere has been like that, too. ANASTASIO: Huge. It\u2019s everything. The fans and the community are everything. We have intelligent, focused fans and we have to honor that. You know, they\u2019re not casual fans and that\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s an honor and it\u2019s a massive responsibility. I feel like the longer this goes, the more we owe. The fans have supported us for 40 years \u2014 it\u2019s our responsibility to keep raising the bar. Which is a great challenge. And it\u2019s very unique. If you really look at the series of events that we continue to put on, that\u2019s the thinking that goes behind it. You know, the fact that there were people in the audience last New Year\u2019s Eve who have seen Phish 300 times, who were crying according to what I heard \u2014 and I was too, by the way \u2014 meant so much to all of us. It\u2019s everything that we want. Which is to honor and respect the people that have been coming to see us for years. We feel like they\u2019re family and they deserve our care and attention about every detail. ANASTASIO: I don\u2019t know, I actually don\u2019t know. ... OK, first of all, I wanted to improve it. As soon as it was over I was like, \u201cOh, I know what I could have (changed).\u201d So then I thought, \u201cOh, we should save all these props that are really \u2014 they\u2019re really expensive.\u201d But then it was kind of like, if there is, it\u2019s going to be better, or it\u2019s going to be built upon. Sort of the way this one was built upon. The previous one, even though it was 30 years ago. I hope it\u2019s not 30 years. I\u2019d like to do it. In the Phish world, it\u2019s like the second it\u2019s over \u2026 the next morning you wake up like I start working on the Sphere. Go meet (co-creative director Abigail Rosen Holmes) downtown at a coffee shop with a laptop and start riffing. I mean, I\u2019m here in Vegas, and yesterday morning I was on a call (about this summer\u2019s Mondegreen festival) with the coolest, smartest people who are working on that. Oh my God.",

            "date": "2024-04-17 14:31:00",
            "content": "Uber is helping investigators look into an account that sent a driver to the Ohio home where an 81-year-old man allegedly shot the woman to death because he erroneously believed she was part of a scam that targeted him, the ride-hailing company said Wednesday. The March 25 shooting death of Loletha Hall is \u201ca horrific tragedy,\" and that account has since been banned, an Uber spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. \"Our hearts continue to be with Loletha's loved ones as they grieve.\u201d William J. Brock was indicted Monday on charges of murder, felonious assault and kidnapping for Hall's death. Messages seeking comment were left Wednesday for him and for his lawyer, Paul Kavanagh of Springfield, Ohio. The grand jury also said that a gun seized from Brock's home, a .22-caliber revolver, is subject to forfeiture. Brock has pleaded not guilty. Police said Brock called 911 before noon to say he had shot someone at his South Charleston home, claiming Hall had tried to rob him. Investigators later said the driver was unaware of the scam call that Brock had received with threats and demands for money, citing an incarcerated relative. Hall \u201cmade no threats or assaults toward Mr. Brock, and made no demands, other than to ask about the package she was sent to retrieve through the Uber app,\u201d the Clark County Sheriff's Office wrote in an April 11 release. The police agency said Brock \u201cproduced a gun and held her at gunpoint, making demands for identities of the subjects he had spoken with on the phone.\" It's not clear exactly what the phone callers said to Brock, but the sheriff's office news release included a reminder, particularly to older people, that law enforcement and courts do not solicit cash for bail money \u201cin the manner of this case.\u201d \u201cWe encourage all citizens to use extreme caution when being contacted unexpectedly by subjects claiming to be relatives incarcerated in a correctional facility, or claiming to have direct knowledge of relatives incarcerated in a correctional facility,\u201d the sheriff's office warned. The FBI in January issued an alert regarding government impersonation scams that send couriers to the homes of their targets \u2014 often older people \u2014 to collect money, or have them purchase gold and other precious metals. The FBI said its Internet Crime Complaint Center recorded that such activity had resulted in losses of more than $55 million in the last eight months of 2023. A 2021 survey of older adults in the Chicago area found that when people were told by a fictitious government agency their personal information was compromised, those with low awareness of scams were particularly vulnerable. Police have said the Hall's Uber trip to pick up a package was ordered by the same person who made scam calls to Brock, or by an accomplice. Brock is accused of taking Hall's cellphone and not letting her leave, then shooting her to death when she tried to get into her vehicle. The sheriff's office said it is investigating \u201cthe original scam call to Mr. Brock by the male subject\u201d and the package delivery order through the app. Brock shot Hall two more times, sustaining a minor head injury himself during the confrontation, and then called 911, police said. Hall, a Columbus resident who police said was not armed, later died at a hospital. He posted $200,000 bail and was released from the Clark County Jail on Wednesday. FBI spokesperson Todd Lindgren with the agency's Cincinnati office said it was aware of the murder but declined to confirm or deny whether it was involved in the case. In an obituary in which her name was given as Lo-Letha \u201cLetha\u201d Toland-Hall, Hall was described as the parent of a son and a stepson, a devoted member of her church and a talented cook known for delicious pound cakes. She retired from Ohio\u2019s Regional Income Tax Agency and also worked in behavioral health, at a school and for Uber. She studied horticulture at Ohio State and started a janitorial business.",

            "title": "Amazon removed Just Walk Out from many of its own stores but wants to sell the system to others",
            "date": "2024-04-17 12:04:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- Amazon wants the public and - especially other businesses - to know it\u2019s not giving up on its Just Walk Out technology. Although the company is ditching the cashier-less checkout system at its Amazon Fresh grocery stores, it plans to sell the technology to more than 120 third-party businesses by the end of the year. Reaching that goal would double the number of non-Amazon enterprises that use Just Walk Out compared to last year. \u201cFor us, really making sure that we can service that third-party market is the most important thing,\u201d Jon Jenkins, the vice president of Just Walk Out at Amazon, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely been reassuring people that we are in this for the long haul.\" Just Walk Out uses cameras, artificial intelligence and sensor trackers to determine what\u2019s taken off of shelves, enabling customers to grab what they want and leave if they insert a credit card or another payment method at a store\u2019s entry gate. The retailer first began offering the technology to other businesses \u2013 such as sports stadiums - in 2020, two years after it started using it at Amazon Go convenience stores. Those stores and some Amazon Fresh stores in the U.K. will continue to offer Just Walk Out. But the technology will be replaced with smart carts at Fresh stores in the U.S., Amazon announced this month. Smart carts, which are already available in some Amazon Fresh locations, use sensors to identify items placed inside and have screens that allow customers to see nearby deals as well as how much their groceries will cost. Customers can skip the checkout line by scanning and tallying up items on its cameras. The change comes as Amazon is working to revamp its Fresh stores with a mix of technology and traditional grocery offerings that will help it attract more customers. The company's grocery store brands include Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, as well as supermarket chain Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion. But Amazon's efforts to become a giant in the U.S. grocery market hasn\u2019t been easy. Early last year, CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that the company was working to find the formula that would allow it to make a larger impact in brick-and-mortar grocery stores. Jenkins argued that removing Just Walk Out from U.S. Amazon Fresh stores did not reflect a miscalculation by the company. Instead, he described the decision as an outgrowth of an experimentation process to figure out what does and doesn\u2019t work for shoppers. \u201cWhat we found is customers in big grocery stores want a shopping assistant to travel along with them,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, \u201cshoppers in smaller store formats tend to be very mission driven. They want to get in and out quickly, with as little friction as possible.\u201d Abandoning the technology in many of its own stores could make it challenging for Amazon to sell Just Walk Out to other businesses. But some experts think the move also could expand adoption among smaller-format stores and locations akin to Amazon Go stores. John Clear, a senior director at the professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal, says he believes cashier-less technology is going to become more common in grab-and-go shopping areas where human interaction tends to be limited, labor is hard to come by and businesses are almost always attempting to cut down on costs. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a natural evolution of the technology, kind of expanding where it\u2019s working\" and drawing back where it's not, Clear said. In its attempt to sell its technology to other businesses, Amazon is also trying to counter some recent viral social media posts that claimed the checkout system was not a technological marvel but was instead powered by contractors in India who manually added up items in carts as customers shopped. Business publication The Information and news website Vox reported in the past that Amazon used human reviewers for the technology, which the company has acknowledged. Jenkins said the company hires associates who take some video clips and label them so they can be used to train the machine learning system. But the notion \u201cpeople in India are watching you shop live in a store and figuring out what you bought is completely inaccurate,\u201d he said. In some cases, when the system was not able to figure out what happened in a store, a human watches a snippet of video to make sure the receipt a customer received was accurate, Jenkins added. Such reviews happen in a \u201csmall minority\u201d of cases, he said, declining to give an estimate. Jenkins also declined to share how many people the company has hired to review and label videos. However, he said it was less than the 1,000 figure cited in media reports.",

            "title": "Hugh Grant says he took 'enormous sum' to settle suit alleging illegal snooping by The Sun tabloid",
            "date": "2024-04-17 08:46:00",
            "content": "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Hugh Grant accepted \u201can enormous sum of money\" to settle a lawsuit accusing The Sun tabloid of unlawfully tapping his phone, bugging his car and breaking into his home to snoop on him, the actor said Wednesday after the agreement was announced in court. Grant said he reluctantly settled because of a court policy that could have stuck him with a huge legal bill even if he prevailed at trial \u2014 a reality that could also force fellow claimant Prince Harry to settle, their lawyer said. A civil court rule intended to avoid jamming up the courts would have required Grant to pay legal fees to both sides if he won at trial but was awarded anything lower than the settlement offer. \u201cAs is common with entirely innocent people, they are offering me an enormous sum of money to keep this matter out of court,\u201d Grant said on the social media platform X. \u201cEven if every allegation is proven in court, I would still be liable for something approaching 10 million pounds ($12.4 million) in costs. I\u2019m afraid I am shying at that fence.\u201d The amount of the settlement was not disclosed. NGN said in a statement that it admitted no liability and said the settlement was in the financial interest of both parties to avoid a costly trial. Grant and other claimants have alleged that NGN, a subsidiary of the media empire built by Rupert Murdoch, violated their privacy through widespread unlawful activity that included hiring private investigators to intercept voicemails, tap phones, bug cars and use deception to access confidential information between 1994 and 2016. Grant is among several celebrities, including actress Sienna Miller, soccer star Paul Gascoigne and Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm, who have settled claims against the publisher. Attorney Gideon Benaim, who was not involved in the case, said the publisher probably used the \u201cincredibly powerful\u201d rules of the court by making an offer Grant was unlikely to surpass at trial. If a judge awarded Grant less than the settlement offer, he would have faced significant legal costs under the rules. \u201cHugh Grant would have been left in little doubt by his lawyers that the offer was pitched so that there was a real risk that he would not \u2018beat\u2019 it at trial,\u201d Benaim said. \u201cTherefore, even though he may have preferred to have fought the case, the financial risks were simply too great and he had, in effect, no choice but to settle.\u201d The settlement leaves The Duke of Sussex and 41 others scheduled to go to trial in the High Court in January, though their lawyer said settlements were being \u201cforced upon\u201d them. \u201cThe Duke of Sussex is subject to the same issues that Sienna Miller and Hugh Grant have been subject to, which is that the offers are made that make it impossible for them to go ahead,\" David Sherborne told a judge Wednesday at a hearing in the case. The settlement came less than a year after Justice Timothy Fancourt rejected NGN\u2019s attempt to throw out Grant\u2019s lawsuit alleging unlawful information gathering. \u201cIf true ... these allegations would establish very serious, deliberate wrongdoing at NGN, conducted on an institutional basis on a huge scale,\u201d Fancourt wrote in May. \u201cThey would also establish a concerted effort to conceal the wrongdoing by hiding and destroying relevant documentary evidence, repeated public denials, lies to regulators and authorities, and unwarranted threats to those who dared to make allegations or notify intended claims against The Sun.\u201d Grant said in a witness statement that he could never figure out who broke into his fourth-floor apartment in 2011. The door had been pried off its hinges and the interior looked like there had been a fight but nothing was missing. Two days later, The Sun had a story detailing the interior and \u201csigns of a domestic row.\u201d He said he was astonished when a private eye hired by The Sun disclosed that people working for the newspaper had burglarized his apartment and placed a tracking device on his car. Grant, who previously settled a case against Murdoch's News of the World for hacking his phone, said he would not go away quietly. \u201cMurdoch\u2019s settlement money has a stink and I refuse to let this be hush money,\" he said. \"I have spent the best part of 12 years fighting for a free press that does not distort the truth, abuse ordinary members of the public or hold elected (members of Parliament) to ransom in pursuit of newspaper barons\u2019 personal profit and political power.\" Grant said he would direct the money to groups like Hacked Off, which was formed after phone hacking revelations in 2011 brought down News of the World and led to a government inquiry into unlawful press practices. Grant is a board member of the group that advocates for a free and accountable press. While the now-defunct News of the World has apologized for hacking the phones of celebrities, politicians and families of dead soldiers and a murdered schoolgirl, The Sun has settled cases without admitting liability. For Prince Harry, the case against The Sun is one of three similar lawsuits he has brought in his crusade to tame the British tabloids. He says the papers have hounded him most of his life and he blames them for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car crash while being pursued by paparazzi. Last year, he won his first case to go to trial when Fancourt found phone hacking was \u201cwidespread and habitual\u201d at Mirror Group Newspapers. In addition to a court judgment, he recently settled remaining allegations that included his legal fees. The total sum wasn\u2019t announced, but he was due to receive an interim payment of 400,000 pounds ($498,000). He has another case pending against the owner of the Daily Mail.",

            "date": "2024-04-17 08:35:00",
            "content": "LONDON -- European Union regulators said Wednesday they're seeking details from TikTok on a new app from the video sharing platform that pays users to watch videos. The European Commission said it sent TikTok a \u201crequest for information\u201d on the TikTok Lite app that has been quietly released in France and Spain . The commission wants to know about the risk assessment that TikTok should have carried out before deploying the app in the European Union. \u201cWe have already been in direct contact with the Commission regarding this product and will respond to the request for information,\" TikTok said in a statement. Such evaluations are required under the bloc's Digital Services Act, a sweeping law that took effect last year with the aim of cleaning up social media platforms. The commission is the 27-nation bloc's executive arm and top enforcer of digital regulations. TikTok Lite lets users \"earn great rewards,\" according to its app store listing. The app, which launched this month in France and Spain, is a slimmed-down version of the main TikTok app and doesn't come with ecommerce or livestreaming features.

            "title": "Tesla to ask shareholders to reinstate $55 billion pay package for Musk",
            "date": "2024-04-17 07:21:00",
            "content": "DETROIT -- Tesla is asking shareholders to restore a $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk that was rejected by a Delaware judge this year, and to shift the company's corporate home to Texas. The changes, to be voted on by stockholders at a June 13 annual meeting, could be a tougher sell than when it was first approved in 2018. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle maker is struggling with falling global sales, slowing electric vehicle demand, an aging model lineup and a stock price that has tumbled 37% so far this year. In January, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick ruled that Musk is not entitled to the landmark stock compensation that was to be granted over 10 years. Ruling on a lawsuit from a shareholder, she voided the pay package, saying that Musk essentially controlled the board, making the process of enacting the compensation unfair to stakeholders. \u201cMusk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla\u2019s behalf,\u201d she wrote in her ruling. But in a letter to shareholders released in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Chairperson Robyn Denholm said that Musk has delivered on the growth it was looking for at the automaker, with Tesla meeting all of the stock value and operational targets in the 2018 package that was approved by shareholders. Shares are up 571% since the pay package began. \u201cBecause the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,\u201d Denholm wrote. \u201cThat strikes us\u2009\u2014\u2009and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard\u2009\u2014\u2009as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it.\u201d In the filing, Tesla said it intends to appeal the decision. If shareholders approve the new package, disclosure and procedural deficiencies and breaches of the board's fiduciary duty detailed by McCormick should be fixed, the filing said. But Tesla said shareholders may still challenge the ratification vote. Even if it does pass, Tesla said it may not fully resolve the matter and a Delaware court could find the ratification itself is not fair to shareholders. If shareholders don\u2019t ratify the plan, Tesla said it may need to negotiate a replacement with Musk. That may take a lot of time and expense \u201cin light of the criticism\u201d detailed in the Delaware suit. Tesla is going the route of ratification, instead of trying to negotiate a new package with Musk, which the company said would likely need to be of similar magnitude to the previous package in order to keep him. Because it\u2019s trying for ratification instead of a new plan, Tesla said it \u201cdid not substantively re-evaluate the amount or term\u201d of the package and did not hire another compensation consultant to weigh in on it. In the 2018 plan, Musk would not get salary or cash bonuses. Instead he was to receive only stock options, and only if the company met certain thresholds. It would need to grow its total market value by certain amounts, while also hitting targets for revenue and pretax earnings, and other items. Many CEOs at big companies need to hit targets to get a lot of their possible compensation. That\u2019s to encourage decisions that benefit the company and shareholders at large. But Musk was unusual in having all of his pay dependent on such measures. When the company\u2019s board drew up the compensation plan, it said it thought the hurdles would be challenging to meet. Some outsiders agreed. But the shareholder plaintiff in the Delaware suit alleged the company\u2019s proxy wrongly characterized all the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as \u201cstretch\u201d goals, even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote. The board said it believed in 2018 that \u201cmany of Tesla\u2019s prior successes were driven significantly by Mr. Musk\u2019s leadership.\u201d And it wanted to motivate Musk to \u201cdevote his time and energy\u201d to the company when he also had interests in other companies. Erik Gordon, a lawyer and business professor at the University of Michigan, said that since Tesla would still be a Delaware corporation at the time of the vote on the package, shareholders could still challenge it in Delaware courts. But because Tesla disclosed facts in the proxy about the board's ties to Musk, he would expect Tesla to win. \u201cIf the uninterested shareholders are properly informed and they vote in favor of it, the court actually has nothing to do,\" Gordon said. Delaware courts, he said, \u201cwant the corporations to disclose and let the shareholders decide.\u201d Musk may not see much legal benefit from moving Tesla's corporate home to Texas, because the law governing executive pay is similar to Delaware's, Gordon said. \u201cThere's no Texas case that tells you if this had happened in Texas you'd have gotten a different result.\u201d Tesla posted record deliveries of more than 1.8 million electric vehicles worldwide in 2023, but the value its shares has eroded quickly this year as EV sales soften. The company said it delivered 386,810 vehicles from January through March, nearly 9% fewer than it sold in the same period last year. Future growth is in doubt and it may be a challenge to get shareholders to back a fat pay package in an environment where competition has increased worldwide. The proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission does not address Musk\u2019s demand to own 25% of Tesla shares for him to pursue artificial intelligence and robotics at the company. At present he owns 20.5% of the company. In January Musk challenged the Tesla board in a post on X, the social media platform he now owns, to come up with a new compensation package. Unless he gets 25%, he wrote that he\u2019d prefer to build products outside of Tesla, apparently with another company. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who is normally bullish on Tesla, said in an interview that the filing doesn't address multiple issues including Musk's future compensation. \u201cIt's the elephant in the room because Musk has threatened over X, and it's been a massive overhang\" for Tesla stock, Ives said. Musk, he said, needs to commit to being Tesla CEO for three to five years and developing artificial intelligence with the company. When Tesla announces first-quarter earnings next week, Musk needs to spell out growth plans, including the status of the Model 2, a small EV that costs about $25,000, Ives said. Otherwise, dark days lie ahead, he said. \u201cThere's a feeling like the plane is crashing into the ocean and the board is focused on their own salted peanuts,\u201d he said. At the time of the Delaware court ruling, Musk\u2019s package was worth more than $55.8 billion, but the stock slide has cut that to $44.9 billion at the close of trading on Friday, Tesla's filing said. Starting last year, Tesla has cut prices as much as $20,000 on some models. The price cuts caused used electric vehicle values to drop and clipped Tesla\u2019s profit margins. This week, Tesla said it was letting about 10% of its workers go, about 14,000 people. Shares of Tesla Inc. closed down about 1% in Wednesday. ____ Choe and Chapman reported from New York.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON -- A voting technology company targeted by bogus fraud claims related to the 2020 presidential election settled a defamation lawsuit Tuesday against a conservative news outlet. The settlement between Florida-based Smartmatic and One America News Network is the latest development in a larger legal pushback by voting equipment companies that became ensnared in wild conspiracy theories falsely claiming they had flipped votes and cost former President Donald Trump reelection. In a statement, the company said it had \"resolved its litigation with OANN through a confidential settlement.\u201d The dismissal of its lawsuit was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia. Chip Babcock, a Houston-based attorney representing the news outlet, confirmed the case had been resolved but said he was unable to disclose any of the settlement terms. Smartmatic was an odd target for the conspiracy theorists because use of its voting technology and software was so limited. It was used only in Los Angeles County, a Democratic stronghold in a state that was not a presidential battleground and where Trump did not contest his loss. But the company has for years also provided voting services in Venezuela, and that created a springboard for phony claims that a foreign company was involved in a vast conspiracy to flip the election from Trump to Democrat Joe Biden . Smartmatic also has active lawsuits against Fox News and the conservative outlet Newsmax over similar complaints. Fox has said it had a First Amendment right to air claims about an election that were being promoted by prominent figures. Last year, on the eve of a trial, Fox News agreed to pay $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by a much larger voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems, which claimed the network and its hosts spread false claims that its equipment helped rig the election against Trump. Dominion has other defamation lawsuits that remain active, including one against One America News Network. The conspiracy theories relating to voting equipment and software are among the lies about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election won by Biden. Numerous reviews, audits and recounts in the presidential swing states where Trump contested his loss have affirmed Biden's victory, and there has been no evidence of widespread fraud. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is facing federal and state charges related to his attempts to overturn the results.",

Microsoft and the technology holding company G42 announced the deal Tuesday. As part of the agreement, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, will join G42's board of directors. The deal \u201cwas developed in close consultation with both the UAE and U.S. governments,\u201d Microsoft said. Based in Abu Dhabi, G42 runs data centers in the Middle East and elsewhere and has increasingly identified itself as an AI firm. It has built what's considered the world\u2019s leading Arabic-language AI model, known as Jais. Microsoft said G42 will run its AI applications and services on the U.S. tech giant's cloud computing platform, and the two companies will work to bring digital infrastructure to countries where G42 has established a presence in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. G42 has previously said it would cut ties to Chinese hardware suppliers over American concerns it was too close to the Chinese government. The company has faced spying allegations for its ties to a mobile phone app identified as spyware. It has also faced claims it could have gathered genetic material secretly from Americans for the Chinese government. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE's national security adviser, is chairman of the company\u2019s board. The U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday described the UAE as a \u201cglobal player in cutting edge technology\u201d and said it is working with it and other countries toward \u201cverifiable commitments\u201d for the safe development and deployment of such technologies. \"When responsibly managed, investments like the one announced today have the potential to further innovation in digital technologies around the world,\u201d spokesperson Brittany Caplin said in a written statement.",

            "content": "SOUTH CHARLESTON, Ohio -- An Ohio man who authorities say fatally shot an Uber driver who he thought was trying to rob him after scam phone calls deceived them both has been indicted on a murder charge. William Brock, 81, also faces counts of kidnapping and felonious assault in the indictment handed up Monday by a Clark County grand jury. Court documents did not list an attorney for him and a telephone number for Brock could not be located. He has pleaded not guilty and could face a life sentence if convicted on the murder charge. The shooting occurred March 25 at Brock's home in South Charleston. Officers from the county sheriff's office responded there after Brock called 911 and said he had shot someone who was trying to rob him. Brock had received scam calls from someone pretending to be an officer from the local court who eventually began making threats and demanding money, authorities said. The victim, Loletha Hall, 61, was an Uber driver who had been told to retrieve a package from Brock\u2019s home, a request authorities say was possibly made by the same scam caller or an accomplice. Hall had no knowledge of the calls made to Brock, authorities said. When she arrived at the home and got out of her car, Brock pulled out a gun and demanded she tell him who had made the threatening calls. He also took Hall's cellphone and would not let her leave. When Hall tried to get away, Brock shot her once, authorities said, then shot her two more times as they discussed the situation. Brock somehow sustained a minor head injury during the confrontation and he called 911 shortly after he fired the third shot. Hall was taken to a hospital but later died there from her wounds. Brock initially was charged with murder because authorities said Hall did not pose an active threat when she was shot. His next court hearing is scheduled for Monday. The original scam calls to Brock and Hall remain under investigation, authorities said, and it\u2019s not clear yet if the calls were placed by the same person.",

Some deaths occurred when lightning struck farmers harvesting wheat. Rains caused dozens of houses to collapse in the northwest and in eastern Punjab province. Arfan Kathia, a spokesman for the provincial disaster management authority, said 21 people had died in Punjab, where more rains were expected this week. Khursheed Anwar, a spokesman for the disaster management authority in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, said 21 people died there. Rain also lashed the capital, Islamabad, and killed seven people in southwestern Baluchistan province. Streets flooded in the northwestern city of Peshawar and in Quetta, the Baluchistan capital. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in televised remarks that he had ordered authorities to provide relief aid. Pakistan\u2019s water reservoirs would improve because of the rains, he said. Rafay Alam, a Pakistani environmental expert, said such heavy April rainfall is unusual. \u201cTwo years ago, Pakistan witnessed a heat wave in March and April and now we are witnessing rains and it is all of because of climate change, which had caused heavy flooding in 2022,\u201d he said. In 2022, downpours swelled rivers and at one point inundated one-third of Pakistan, killing 1,739 people. The floods also caused $30 billion in damage. Meanwhile, heavy flooding from seasonal rains in Afghanistan killed 33 people and injured 27 others in three days, according to Abdullah Janan Saiq, the Taliban\u2019s spokesman for the State Ministry for Natural Disaster Management. More than 600 houses were damaged or destroyed while around 200 livestock died. The flooding also damaged large areas of agricultural land and more than 85 kilometers (53 miles) of roads, he said.

The National Weather Service said nearly 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of rain fell in a short time late Thursday afternoon and evening in parts of Allegheny County. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that some southern sections of the county got more than 4 inches as they got stuck under heavier bands within the storm system. Rescue crews in the Pittsburgh suburb of Oakdale used watercraft to evacuate or rescue some residents, while officials in nearby Etna issued an emergency evacuation notice as Pine Creek breeched its banks at over 14 feet (4.3 meters). For the second time in a week, flood warnings were issued in West Virginia along the Ohio River, which was forecast to crest in the Pittsburgh area at above 25 feet late Friday into Saturday \u2014 well into flood stage. The river was at nearly 22 feet late Friday morning, a rapid rise from about 16.5 feet on Thursday morning, before the heavy rains moved into the region. In Parkersburg, a portion of a loose barge struck a CSX railroad trestle spanning the swollen Little Kanawha River. Video from WTAP-TV showed the barge made contact with the trestle Friday morning as a train was moving across it before a towboat brought the barge until control. CSX was inspecting the trestle for structural damage. The Little Kanawha flows into the Ohio River. Parts of New England were also dealing with flooding as more rain came early Friday.

            "content": "SLIDELL, La. -- Severe storms blamed for a death in Mississippi spawned a tornado that demolished buildings in one Louisiana city Wednesday while inundating streets in low-lying New Orleans with hours of steady rain that snarled traffic and strained the city\u2019s antiquated drainage system. Severe weather stretched across much of the Gulf South with reports of damage from Texas to the Florida panhandle. More than 30,000 homes and businesses were without power Wednesday night in Louisiana's St. Tammany Parish, where a tornado struck the city of Slidell, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of New Orleans. It ripped roofs off buildings and partially collapsed others in and around the city of about 28,000 people. Authorities said first responders had to rescue people trapped in one heavily damaged apartment building. At a Wednesday night news conference, Slidell Mayor Greg Cromer estimated about 75 homes and businesses were damaged in the city. Parish President Mike Cooper said assessments were still underway, but he estimated that hundreds more homes were damaged outside the city. Police video showed tree limbs littering the streets and flooded yards that resembled Louisiana swamps. Outside a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, a car was on its side, power poles leaned toward the ground and large pieces of the restaurant\u2019s trademark golden arches were strewn about. \u201cI\u2019ve never talked to God so much before in my life,\u201d Robin Marquez said after huddling with coworkers in a two-story building where the roof was ripped away and walls caved in. There were no reports of deaths or critical injuries in Slidell. The National Weather Service said in a social media post Wednesday night that initial surveys of the damage indicate the area was hit by a category EF-1 tornado, with winds anywhere from 86 mph (138 kph) to 110 miles per hour (177 kph). More surveys and analyses were planned to confirm the twister's strength and path. Close to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Orleans. It came as the system of pipes and pumps that drains the city dealt with problems with its power generating system, forcing workers to divert power from one area to another as needed. \u201cDuring intense rain, the mission sometimes shifts from keeping the streets dry to draining them as quickly as possible,\u201d the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board, which operates the system, said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. Hours after the rain ended, floodwaters lingered in some neighborhoods in New Orleans and in neighboring Jefferson Parish. In Mississippi, the death of Shirley Wilson, 64, was attributed to the storm. Wilson had several medical conditions that required her to have access to an electric oxygen machine at all times, Scott County Sheriff Mike Lee said. When her home in the central Mississippi county lost power, her oxygen machine shut down. Emergency responders couldn't reach her until about 20 minutes after her grandchild called 911 early Wednesday, and she was pronounced dead. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said 72 homes were damaged. In Texas, several people were rescued from homes and vehicles early Wednesday morning when flooding inundated parts of Jasper County, near the Louisiana line, authorities said. All major roads into Kirbyville, a Jasper County town of about 2,000 people, were shut down early Wednesday due to the flooding, the sheriff's office said. Shelters were being set up after about 50 people were displaced from their homes, Billy Ted Smith, the Jasper County emergency management coordinator, said. He estimated the displaced people came from about 20 flooded homes and said there had been around half a dozen people rescued from vehicles. He said no major injuries were reported. In the Houston suburb of Katy, strong thunderstorms that passed through the area around 2 a.m. Wednesday collapsed part of the roof of a Firestone repair shop. Storms also damaged businesses and cars in a nearby strip mall, sending a large air conditioning unit that had been on the roof crashing to the parking lot, officials said. No one was inside the repair shop, but employees were working at a nearby sports bar when the thunderstorms rolled through, Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen told reporters later Wednesday morning. \u201cWe were blessed that no lives were lost,\u201d Christensen said, adding that only minor injuries were reported. Some of the damage in Katy had preliminarily been determined to have been caused by an EF-1 tornado with estimated maximum winds of around 90 mph (145 kph), National Weather Service meteorologist Bradley Brokamp said. Photos posted on social media showed heavy damage to a church in Port Arthur, Texas, where city officials said they were also dealing with downed trees and powerlines. In Mississippi, the sheriff sent out an urgent warning Wednesday to people in parts of Yazoo County, just northwest of Jackson, about a levee failure there.

            "content": "OTTAWA, Ontario -- Canada's emergency preparedness minister warned Wednesday the country's wildfire season could be more explosive than last year when it led to unprecedented smoke conditions across much of the country and into the United States. Persistent drought and months of above-average temperatures have raised the risk of a repeat of last year\u2019s record-breaking wildfires, prompting federal ministers to wave a red warning flag about the desperate need to address climate change. \u201cWe can expect that the wildfire season will start sooner, end later and potentially be more explosive,\u201d Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan told a news conference. The Canadian wildfire season runs from May through October. The 2023 fire season was Canada\u2019s worst on record, burning more than 15 million hectares and forcing more than 230,000 people from their homes. Smoke from Canadian wildfires poured into the U.S. East Coast and Midwest last June. A briefing document forecasting the fire risk for the spring shows conditions are already ripe this year for an early and above-normal fire risk from Quebec all the way to British Columbia in both April and May. The forecast is based on having had a warmer than normal winter with minimal snow and widespread drought, particularly in the Canadian Prairies. There is also a high probability for above normal temperatures in April, May and June. Human activity is typically the main fire risk factor in the spring, said Michael Norton, the director general of the Northern Forestry Centre at Natural Resources Canada. That can include careless burning, campfires, fireworks and the heat from off-road vehicles igniting grass or other debris on the ground. Lightning becomes a primary source of wildfires during the summer. Sajjan said Canada has been working for months to prepare for the upcoming season, and promised additional funding for firefighting equipment and training. ___ Follow AP\u2019s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- True love's kiss or an invite to the Met Gala? Those in the rarified ranks of international celebrity \u2014 and Anna Wintour's good graces \u2014 need not choose. Stars of film, fashion, music, sports, politics and social media will ascend the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the first Monday in May \u2014 May 6, that is \u2014 to sip cocktails, have dinner and sample the new exhibit, \u201cSleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" As fashion's biggest night approaches, it's time for The Associated Press to issue the 2024 version of our annual guide. It started in 1948 as a society midnight supper, and wasn\u2019t even at the Met. Fast forward 70-plus years, and it's one of the most photographed events in the world, renowned for its head-spinning red carpet \u2014 though the carpet isn\u2019t always red. It\u2019s important to note, though, that the party has a purpose, raising money for the Met\u2019s Costume Institute \u2014 nearly $22 million last year, a record for the self-funding department \u2014 and launching the annual spring exhibit that brings hundreds of thousands of visitors to the museum. But it\u2019s the carpet itself that draws the world\u2019s eyes, with the 400-strong guest list the subject of rabid speculation until the last minute \u2014 a collection of luminaries that arguably makes for the highest celebrity wattage-per-square-foot of any party in the world. \u201cAnna Wintour Me Pregunt\u00f3,\u201d Bad Bunny could sing. Multi-hyphenate Jennifer Lopez adds yet another role to her busy year. And then there are two Marvel stars who have been spending a lot of time in the desert lately: Zendaya, who has continued to stun on red carpets with her \u201cDune\u201d and \u201cChallengers\u201d looks, and Chris Hemsworth, who is trading in Mjolnir for the upcoming \u201cFuriosa.\u201d (Hemsworth is, in fact, a first-time gala attendee. ) And, of course, Wintour herself. The theme revolves around \u201csleeping beauties,\u201d but has little to do with fairytales. \u201cSleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" the title of the accompanying exhibit, refers to garments from the Costume Institute's collection that have been \u201cin slumber\u201d and now will be on display, some too fragile to hang upright lest they disintegrate. Curator Andrew Bolton picked 250 pieces spanning four centuries. The theme is accompanied by a dress code \u2014 this year, it's \u201cThe Garden of Time.\u201d The theme and dress code are often interpreted ... loosely. So there's a chance you may see an Aurora on the carpet, after all. Wrong question. You cannot just buy a ticket. The right question is: If I were famous or powerful and got invited, how much would it cost? Well, you might not pay yourself. Generally companies buy tables. A fashion label would then host its desired celebrities. Tickets have in the past cost $50,000 for an individual, and $300,000 or more for a table. You can watch the whole carpet unfold on a Vogue livestream. If you\u2019re in New York, you can also join fans across the street, behind barricades, on Fifth Avenue or even further east on Madison. And the AP will have a livestream of departures from the Mark Hotel, where many gala guests get ready. Entering the museum, guests walk past what is usually an impossibly enormous flower arrangement in the lobby, with perhaps an orchestra playing nearby, and over to cocktails. Or, they head to view the exhibit. Cocktails are about 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., followed by dinner, but the most famous \u2014 or those who plan to make the biggest entrance \u2014 sometimes come (fashionably) later.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 00:17:00",
            "content": "LAS VEGAS -- Work is set to begin Monday on a $12 billion high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area, with officials projecting millions of ticket-buyers will be boarding trains by 2028. Brightline West, whose sister company already operates a fast train between Miami and Orlando in Florida, aims to lay 218 miles (351 kilometers) of new track between a terminal to be built just south of the Las Vegas Strip and another new facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Almost the full distance is to be built in the median of Interstate 15, with a station stop in San Bernardino County\u2019s Victorville area. In a statement, Brightline Holdings founder and Chairperson Wes Edens called the moment \u201cthe foundation for a new industry.\u201d Brightline aims to link other U.S. cities that are too near to each other for flying between them to make sense and too far for people to drive the distance, Edens said. CEO Mike Reininger has said the goal is to have trains operating in time for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to take part in Monday's groundbreaking. Brightline received $6.5 billion in backing from the Biden administration, including a $3 billion grant from federal infrastructure funds and approval to sell another $2.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds. The company won federal authorization in 2020 to sell $1 billion in similar bonds. The project is touted as the first true high-speed passenger rail line in the nation, designed to reach speeds of 186 mph (300 kph), comparable to Japan\u2019s Shinkansen bullet trains. The route between Vegas and L.A. is largely open space, with no convenient alternate to I-15. Brightline\u2019s Southern California terminal will be at a commuter rail connection to downtown Los Angeles. The project outline says electric-powered trains will cut the four-hour trip across the Mojave Desert to a little more than two hours. Forecasts are for 11 million one-way passengers per year, or some 30,000 per day, with fares well below airline travel costs. The trains will offer rest rooms, Wi-Fi, food and beverage sales and the option to check luggage. Las Vegas is a popular driving destination for Southern Californians. Officials hope the train line will relieve congestion on I-15, where motorists often sit in miles of crawling traffic while returning home from a Las Vegas weekend. The Las Vegas area, now approaching 3 million residents, draws more than 40 million visitors per year. Passenger traffic at the city's Harry Reid International Airport set a record of 57.6 million people in 2023. An average of more than 44,000 automobiles per day crossed the California-Nevada state line on I-15 in 2023, according to Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority data. Florida-based Brightline Holdings already operates the Miami-to-Orlando line with trains reaching speeds up to 125 mph (200 kph). It launched service in 2018 and expanded service to Orlando International Airport last September. It offers 16 round-trips per day, with one-way tickets for the 235-mile (378-kilometer) distance costing about $80. Other fast trains in the U.S. include Amtrak\u2019s Acela, which can top 150 mph (241 kph) while sharing tracks with freight and commuter service between Boston and Washington, D.C. Ideas for connecting other U.S. cities with high-speed passenger trains have been floated in recent years, including Dallas to Houston; Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina; and Chicago to St. Louis. Most have faced delays. In California, voters in 2008 approved a proposed 500-mile (805-kilometer) rail line linking Los Angeles and San Francisco, but the plan has been beset by rising costs and routing disputes. A 2022 business plan by the California High-Speed Rail Authority projected the cost had more than tripled to $105 billion.",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- One of the country's leading artist residency programs, MacDowell, has awarded a lifetime achievement prize to Yoko Ono. The groundbreaking artist, filmmaker and musician is this year's recipient of the Edward MacDowell Medal, an honor previously given to Stephen Sondheim and Toni Morrison among others. \u201cThere has never been anyone like her; there has never been work like hers,\u201d MacDowell board chair Nell Painter said in a statement Sunday. \"Over some seven decades, she has rewarded eyes, provoked thought, inspired feminists, and defended migrants through works of a wide-ranging imagination. Enduringly fresh and pertinent, her uniquely powerful oeuvre speaks to our own times, so sorely needful of her leitmotif: Peace.\u201d Ono's son, Sean Ono Lennon, said in a statement that the medal was \u201can incredible honor.\u201d \u201cThe history and list of past recipients is truly remarkable. It makes me very proud to see her art appreciated and celebrated in this way,\" he said. Ono, 91, has made few public appearances in recent years and is not expected to attend the July awards ceremony, at the MacDowell campus in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Ono's music manager, David Newgarden, will accept the award on her behalf. Ono first became known as part of the avant-garde Fluxus movement of the 1960s, then reached international fame after meeting John Lennon, to whom she was married from 1969 until his death, in 1980. Their many collaborations included the songs \u201cGive Peace a Chance,\u201d \u201cImagine\u201d and \u201cHappy Xmas (War Is Over),\" the basis for \u201cWar Is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko,\u201d this year's winner of the Oscar for best animated short film. Over the past 40 years, Ono has had a busy career as a visual and recording artist, her albums including \u201cSeason of Glass,\u201d \u201cStarpeace\u201d and \u201cTake Me to the Land of Hell.\u201d She was recently the subject of a career retrospective at London's Tate Modern.",

Blige, Cher, Foreigner, A Tribe Called Quest, Kool & The Gang and Ozzy Osbourne have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame , a class that also includes folk-rockers Dave Matthews Band and singer-guitarist Peter Frampton . Alexis Korner, John Mayall and Big Mama Thornton earned the Musical Influence Award, while the late Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick and Norman Whitfield will get the Musical Excellence Award. Pioneering music executive Suzanne de Passe won the Ahmet Ertegun Award. \u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 roll is an ever-evolving amalgam of sounds that impacts culture and moves generations,\u201d John Sykes, chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, said in a statement. \u201cThis diverse group of inductees each broke down musical barriers and influenced countless artists that followed in their footsteps.\u201d The induction ceremony will be held Oct. 19 at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in Cleveland, Ohio. It will stream live on Disney+ with an airing on ABC at a later date and available on Hulu the next day. Those music acts nominated this year but didn't make the cut included Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz, the late Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor , soul-pop singer Sade, Britpoppers Oasis, hip-hop duo Eric B. & Rakim and alt-rockers Jane\u2019s Addiction. There had been a starry push to get Foreigner \u2014 with the hits \u201cUrgent\u201d and \"Hot Blooded\" \u2014 into the hall, with Mark Ronson, Jack Black, Slash, Dave Grohl and Paul McCartney all publicly backing the move. Ronson's stepfather is Mick Jones, Foreigner's founding member, songwriter and lead guitarist. Osbourne, who led many parents in the 1980s to clutch their pearls with his devil imagery and sludgy music, goes in as a solo artist, having already been inducted into the hall with metal masters Black Sabbath. Four of the eight nominees \u2014 Cher, Foreigner, Frampton and Kool & the Gang \u2014 were on the ballot for the first time. Cher \u2014 the only artist to have a No. 1 song in each of the past six decades \u2014 and Blige, with eight multi-platinum albums and nine Grammy Awards, will help boost the number of women in the hall, which critics say is too low. Artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they\u2019re eligible for induction. Nominees were voted on by more than 1,000 artists, historians and music industry professionals. Fans voted online or in person at the museum, with the top five artists picked by the public making up a \u201cfans\u2019 ballot\u201d that was tallied with the other professional ballots. Last year, Missy Elliott, Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Chaka Khan, \u201cSoul Train\u201d creator Don Cornelius, Kate Bush and the late George Michael were some of the artists who got into the hall . ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",

            "content": "PAYSON, Utah -- Actor Kevin Bacon on Saturday returned to the Utah high school where the cult classic movie \u201cFootloose\u201d was filmed more than 40 years. Bacon danced his way to a stage on a Payson High School athletic field Saturday to greet students before what likely was the final prom held at the school, which is set to be torn down next spring. \u201cYou talked me into it,\" Bacon said, according to video posted by Salt Lake City's ABC 4. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that kind of commitment to anything. I also think that it\u2019s amazing to see the power that this movie has had to bring people together.\u201d Bacon starred in \u201cFootloose\u201d as a Chicago teen who moved to a small town and fought its ban on dancing. Payson High School students ended Saturday with a \u201cFootloose\u201d-themed prom, just as the movie ended. About 21,000 people live in Payson, which is about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City. Principal Jesse Sorenson said students for years have tried to persuade Bacon to visit. What started as lighthearted appeals on social media turned into a community wide campaign to partner with Bacon's charity, Sorenson said. Students agreed to help put together 5,000 care packages for the charity, SixDegrees, to convince Bacon to visit. Students for weeks wrote hopeful messages for the eventual owners of each of the care packages and worked with the Utah Film Commission and SixDegrees to raise money and donations of toiletries, clothing and other items to go in the backpacks, Sorenson said. On Saturday, Bacon helped fill the bags alongside what Sorenson estimated was about 700 students and 300 community members. Sorenson, who graduated from Payson High School in 1995, said DJs always play the song \u201cFootloose\u201d at proms, and students recreate the film's iconic dance. Older residents tell stories of being an extra in the film and delight in pointing out spots in Payson shown in the movie, he said. \u201cIt's something they can be proud of, and it\u2019s fun for them,\u201d the principal said.",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cCivil War,\u201d Alex Garland\u2019s ominous American dystopia, remained the top film in theaters in its second week of release, according to studio estimates Sunday. The A24 election -year gamble, the indie studio\u2019s biggest budgeted film yet, took in $11.1 million in ticket sales at 3,929 theaters over the weekend. The $50 million film, set in a near-future U.S. in which Texas and California have joined in rebellion against a fascist president, has grossed $44.9 million in two weeks. Its provocative premise \u2013 and A24\u2019s marketing, which included images of U.S. cities ravaged by war \u2013 helped keep \u201cCivil War\u201d top of mind for moviegoers. But it was a painfully slow weekend in theaters \u2013 the kind sure to add to concern over what\u2019s thus far been a down year for Hollywood at the box office. Year-to-date ticket sales are down almost 20% compared to last year, according to Comscore. Going into the weekend, Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cAbigail,\u201d a critically acclaimed R-rated horror film about the daughter of Dracula, had been expected to lead ticket sales. It came in second with $10.2 million in 3,384 theaters. That was still a fair result for a film that cost a modest $28 million to make. \u201cAbigail,\u201d which remakes the 1936 monster film \u201cDracula\u2019s Daughter,\u201d is about a 12-year-old girl taken by kidnappers who soon realize they\u2019ve made a poor choice of hostage. It\u2019s directed by the duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett whose production company goes by the name Radio Silence. More concerning was the overall tepid response for a handful of new wide releases \u2013 and the likelihood that there will be more similar weekends throughout 2024. Last year\u2019s actors and writers' strikes, which had a prolonged effect on the movie pipeline, exacerbated holes in Hollywood\u2019s release schedule. Horror films, in recent years among the most reliable cash cows in theaters, also haven\u2019t thus far been doing the automatic business they previous did. According to David A. Gross, who runs the consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, horror releases accounted for $2 billion in worldwide sales in 2023. Guy Ritchie\u2019s \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\u201d debuted with $9 million in 2,845 theaters. In the based-on-a-true-story Lionsgate release, which reportedly cost $60 million to produce, Henry Cavill leads a World War II mission off the coast of West Africa. Though Ritchie has been behind numerous box-office hits, including the live-action \u201cAladdin\u201d and a pair of Sherlock Holmes films, his recent movies have struggled to find big audiences. The Lionsgate spy comedy \u201cOperation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre\u201d grossed $48 million against a $50 million budget, while MGM\u2019s \u201cThe Covenant,\u201d also released last year, made $21 million while costing $55 million to make. A bright sign for \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\u201d: audiences liked it. The film earned an A-minus CinemaScore. The anime \u201cSpy x Family Code: White,\u201d from Sony\u2019s Crunchyroll, also struggled to stand out with audiences. Though the adaptation of the Tatsuya Endo manga TV series \u201cSpy x Family\u201d has already been a hit with international moviegoers, it debuted below expectations with $4.9 million in 2,009 U.S. theaters. The mightiest film globally, though, continues to be \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\u201d The Warner Bros. monster movie has for the past month led worldwide ticket sales. It added another $9.5 million domestically and $21.6 million internationally to bring its four-week global total to $485.2 million. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. \u201cCivil War,\u201d $11.1 million. 2. \u201cAbigail,\u201d $10.2 million. 3. \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire,\u201d $9.5 million. 4. \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,\u201d $9 million. 5. \u201cSpy x Family Code: White,\u201d $4.9 million. 6. \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\" $4.6 million. 7. \u201cGhostbusters: Frozen Empire,\u201d $4.4 million. 8. \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d $2.9 million. 9. \u201cMonkey Man,\u201d $2.2 million. 10. \u201cThe First Omen,\u201d $1.7 million.",

            "content": "Andrew Davis, an acclaimed British conductor who was music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and orchestras on three continents, has died. He was 80. Davis died Saturday at Rusk Institute in Chicago from leukemia, his manager, Jonathan Brill of Opus 3 Artists, said Sunday. Davis had been managing the disease for between 1 1/2 and 2 years, but it became acute shortly after his 80th birthday on Feb. 2. He had conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra last December in the U.S. premiere of his own orchestration of Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah.\u201d \u201cA consummate musician, incredibly versatile and a phenomenal colleague, as well,\" soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming said in an email to The Associated Press. \"It takes a special kind of command to be a great conductor, the power to make close to a hundred musicians (each one, at heart, a diva or divo) hang on your tiniest gesture. So it is remarkable that even with that strength, Andrew\u2019s primary quality was his innate happiness. He was gifted with an infectious joy that somehow came through in every bar of music he made.\u201d As his 80th birthday approached, Davis was invigorated by the challenge of molding an orchestra, especially young players. \u201cHarnessing all that energy and that enthusiasm and that passion, and galvanizing it into a totally, totally unified conception and not just conception but \u2014 what's the word? \u2014 realization,\" he said during an interview with the AP last July after rehearsing the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America in workshops and then at New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall. \u201cI berate them more than I would, but I hope always with a twinkle in my eye.\u201d Davis was music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra from 1975-88 and Britain's Glyndebourne Festival from 1988-2000; chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1989-2000 and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra from 2013-19; then music director of the Lyric Opera from 2000-21. Davis made his Lyric Opera debut in 1987 and led about 700 performances of 62 operas by 22 composers. \u201cHe was a true artistic partner to me and a shining light for so many of us,\u201d Lyric Opera general director Anthony Freud said in a statement. \u201cWe will miss his incredible artistry, his extraordinary wisdom, his irrepressible humor, his unfettered zest for life and his devotion to the arts and the humanities.\u201d Davis conducted a dozen Last Night of the Proms concerts, an annual celebration of Britain at London's Royal Albert Hall. He twice gave the customary speech in the patter of the Major General\u2019s song from Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s \u201cThe Pirates of Penzance.\u201d Born in Ashridge, in the Hertfordshire county of England, Andrew Frank Davis played organ for his parish choir and joined the choir at the Watford Grammar School for Boys. He studied piano at London's Royal Academy of Music in London, became an organ student at King\u2019s College Cambridge, and played piano, harpsichord and organ with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields from 1966-70. He made his conducting debut with the BBC Symphony in 1970, became an assistant conductor with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Philharmonia Orchestra, then in 1971 made his North American debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. \u201cOne of the finest conductors of his generation,\u201d Carnegie Hall executive and artistic director Clive Gillinson said. \u201cI worked with him on an ongoing basis at the London Symphony Orchestra, and the players and I were always totally engaged by his superb musicianship.\" Davis made his opera-conducting debut in Strauss' \u201cCapriccio\u201d at the Glyndebourne in 1973 and the following year met his future wife, soprano Gianna Rolandi, when she sang Zerbinetta in performances of Strauss' \u201cAriadne auf Naxos\u201d that he led at New York's Metropolitan Opera. They got married in 1989 and had a son, composer Edward Frazier Davis. Davis became a Commander of the British Empire in 1992 and a Knight Bachelor in 1999. The family moved to Chicago when he was hired by the Lyric Opera. During the pandemic, Davis translated Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid\u201d from Latin into English verse. \"I took an entrance exam in classics in New College, Oxford,\" he told NPR, \u201cbut then a couple of weeks later I took the organ scholarship trials at King's College, Cambridge, which much to my surprise I won, so that was the end of classics for me.\u201d His wife died in 2021. In addition to his son, he is survived by a sister, Jill Atkins, and brothers Martin Davis and Tim Davis. Funeral services will be private. ___ This story corrects the year Davis made his Lyric Opera debut. It was in 1987, not 1986.",

Los Angeles County Fire Department units responded shortly after 9 p.m. Saturday to the theme park in Universal City, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) northwest of downtown LA, the agency said in a social media post. The California Highway Patrol said that while the tram was negotiating a turn, its last car collided with a metal guardrail, \u201ccausing it to tilt and eject multiple passengers.\u201d The fire department said 15 people were taken to hospitals with minor injuries. The highway patrol's statement on Sunday said some of the injuries were moderate, but didn't specify a number. Universal Studios Hollywood said in a statement Sunday afternoon that tours have resumed with a modified route. \u201cOur thoughts continue to be with the guests who were involved, and we are thankful that based on agency reports, the injuries sustained were minor. We are working closely with public agencies, including the California Highway Patrol, as we continue our review of the incident and safety remains a top priority,\u201d the statement said.

            "content": "If you were to close Alicia Keys \u2019 big semi-autobiographical musical on Broadway with any of her hit songs, which would it be? Of course, it has to be \u201cEmpire State of Mind.\u201d That\u2019s the natural one, right? It\u2019s also as predictable as the R train being delayed with signal problems. \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d the coming-of-age musical about a 17-year-old piano prodigy named Ali, has wonderful new and old tunes by the 16-time Grammy Award winner and a talented cast, but only a sliver of a very safe story that tries to seem more consequential than it is. It wants to be authentic and gritty \u2014 a remarkable number of swear words are used, including 19 f-bombs \u2014 for what ultimately is a portrait of a young, talented woman living on the 42nd floor of a doorman building in Manhattan who relearns to love her protective mom. The musical that opened Saturday at the Shubert Theatre features reworks of Keys\u2019 best-known hits: \u201cFallin\u2019,\u201d \u201cNo One,\u201d \u201cGirl on Fire,\u201d \u201cIf I Ain\u2019t Got You,\u201d as well as several new songs, including the terrific \u201cKaleidoscope.\u201d That Keys is a knockout songwriter, there is no doubt. That playwright Kristoffer Diaz is able to make a convincing, relatable rom-com that's also socially conscious is very much in doubt. This is, appropriately, a woman-led show, with Maleah Joi Moon completely stunning in the lead role \u2014 a jaw-dropping vocalist who is funny, giggly, passionate and strident, a star turn. Shoshana Bean, who plays her single, spiky mom, makes her songs soar, while Kecia Lewis as a soulful piano teacher is the show's astounding MVP. When we meet Ali, she's a frustrated teen who knows there's more to life and \u201csomething's calling me,\u201d as she sings in the new song, \u201cThe River.\u201d At first that's a boy: the sweet Chris Lee, playing a house painter. There's also reconnecting with her unreliable dad, a nicely slippery Brandon Victor Dixon. But the thing calling Ali is, of course, the grand piano in her building's multipurpose room. Outside this apartment building in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood \u2014 we get a clue the time is the early 1990s \u2014 are \u201croaches and the rats/heroin in the cracks.\u201d But no criminality is shown \u2014 at worst some illegal krumping? \u2014 and the cops don\u2019t actually brutalize those citizens deemed undesirable. They sort of just shoo them away. This is a sanitized New York for the M & M store tourists, despite the lyrics in Keys\u2019 songs. Another reason the musical fails to fully connect is that a lot of the music played onstage is fake \u2014 it's actually the orchestra tucked into the sides making those piano scales and funky percussion. (Even the three bucket drummers onstage are mostly just pretending, which is a shame.) For a musical about a singular artist and how important music is, this feels a bit like a cheat. Choreography by Camille A. Brown is muscular and fun using a hip-hop vocabulary, and director Michael Greif masterfully keeps things moving elegantly. But there's \u2014 forgive me \u2014 everything but the kitchen sink thrown in here: A supposed-to-be-funny chorus of two mom friends and two Ali friends, a ghost, some mild parental abuse and a weird fixation with dinner. The way the songs are integrated is inspired, with \u201cGirl on Fire\u201d hysterically interrupted by rap bars, \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d turned into a humorously seductive ballad and \"No One\u201d transformed from an achy love song to a mother-daughter anthem. But everyone is waiting for that song about \u201cconcrete jungles\u201d where \u201cbig lights will inspire you.\u201d It comes right after we see a young woman snuggling on a couch, high over the city she will soon conquer. You can, too, if you just go past the doorman and follow your dreams. ___ Follow Mark Kennedy online.",

Even while playing in an era of grinding it out on the ground, he still holds the Rams\u2019 team record with 154 touchdown passes. Gabriel, the first Filipino-American quarterback in the NFL and the league MVP in 1969, died Saturday. He was 83. His son, Roman Gabriel III, announced his father\u2019s death on social media, saying he died peacefully at home of natural causes. In 2021, the elder Gabriel told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cI am retired with heart problems and arthritis but happy.\" He said he split time between Wilmington, North Carolina, and Little River, South Carolina. \u201cWe mourn the loss of Rams legend and football pioneer, Roman Gabriel,\u201d the Rams said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Gabriel, who played at North Carolina State and was a two-time player of the year in the Atlantic Coast Conference, was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989. He was 6-foot-5 and 235 pounds, big for a quarterback in that era. Green Bay coach Vince Lombardi once described him as \u201ca big telephone pole,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times. Gabriel played 11 years for the Rams and five years with the Philadelphia Eagles, where he was traded after the Rams acquired John Hadl. \u201cGabe was an amazing player and an even better mentor. Words can't explain my thanks for what a great teammate he was,\u201d retired quarterback Ron Jaworski, whom Gabriel backed up on the Eagles in his final season, posted on X. \u201cA special player and a better man!\u201d Gabriel was such a hot prospect that the Rams made him the No. 2 pick in the NFL draft, and the Oakland Raiders of the rival AFL selected him No. 1. Gabriel wound up signing with the Rams, though it took until George Allen was hired as coach in 1966 for Gabriel to start leaving a mark. From 1967 to 1970, Gabriel led the Rams to a 41-14-4 record and two division titles, though never a playoff game. He was voted MVP in 1969 after throwing for 2,549 yards with 24 touchdown passes and five rushing scores. Allen left for Washington after the 1970, and Gabriel was shipped to the Eagles in 1973. He was the NFL comeback player of the year, leading the league with 23 touchdown passes and 3,219 yards, as he tried to help revive the Eagles' offense. After retiring, Gabriel worked briefly for CBS, calling NFL games. He went into coaching, with stints at Cal Poly Pomona, the Boston Breakers of the USFL and Raleigh-Durham in the World League of American Football. Gabriel also dabbled in acting. His movie credits included \u201cSkidoo\u201d starring Jackie Gleason in 1968, and 1969's \u201cThe Undefeated\u201d starring John Wayne and Rock Hudson. He appeared in such TV shows as \u201cGilligan's Island,\u201d \u201cPerry Mason,\u201d \u201cIronside\u201d and \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d He also joined Bob Hope on a USO tour of Vietnam. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

            "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country music star Morgan Wallen, who faces charges stemming in part from accusations that he threw a chair off the rooftop of a six-story bar, says he\u2019s \u201cnot proud\u201d of his behavior and accepts responsibility. The \u201cOne Thing at a Time\u201d singer responded publicly Friday night on social media to his arrest in Nashville two weeks ago. He faces a May 3 court date after being charged with three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct, court records show. An arrest affidavit said the chair at Chief\u2019s bar landed about 3 feet (1 meter) from officers, who talked to witnesses and reviewed security footage. Witnesses told officers that they watched Wallen pick up a chair, throw it over the roof and laugh about it. Wallen was booked early April 8 and released. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks. I\u2019ve touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family, and the good people at Chief\u2019s. I\u2019m not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility,\u201d Wallen wrote on X, formerly Twitter . Wallen, one of the biggest names in contemporary country, is currently on a stadium tour, including a concert scheduled for Saturday at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in Oxford, Mississippi. \u201cI have the utmost respect for the officers working every day to keep us all safe. Regarding my tour, there will be no change,\u201d his message said, signed \u201d-MW.\u201d The \u201cOne Thing at a Time\u201d album spent 16 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 in 2023 and was the most-consumed album in the U.S. last year. Top 10 hits from the album included \u201cLast Night,\u201d \u201cYou Proof\u201d and \u201cThinkin\u2019 Bout Me.\u201d In 2021, the country singer was suspended indefinitely from his label after video surfaced of him shouting a racial slur. In 2020, he was arrested on public intoxication and disorderly conduct charges after being kicked out of Kid Rock\u2019s bar in downtown Nashville.",

            "content": "Romeo Castellucci dropped out of his production of Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle at Belgium\u2019s La Monnaie theater halfway through because of what the company said Saturday was a lack of money and time. The four-part \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung)\u201d is considered opera\u2019s most ambitious work. Castellucci, a noted Italian director, began with \u201cDas Rheingold\u201d that opened in Brussels last Nov. 24 and \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d on Jan. 21, directing and designing the sets, costumes and lighting. He had intended to use a full-length film during \u201cSiegfried\u201d and what the Monnaie called a \u201cdouble opera and theatre project\u201d for \u201cG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung (The Twilight of the Gods).\u201d \u201cAfter many months of preparation, investigation and study, we have had to come jointly to the conclusion that we could not arrive at a way to realize these concepts within the available timing and budgetary frame,\u201d the Monnaie said Saturday in announcing its 2024-25 season. \u201cWe all hope that it will be possible to see the completion of this ambitious project at some stage in the future.\u201d Pierre Audi, general director of the Aix-en-Provence Festival and artistic director of New York\u2019s Park Avenue Armory, will take over with a new production team for \u201cSiegfried\u201d opening Sept. 11 and \u201cG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\u201d starting Feb. 4. Audi directed the Ring at De Nederlandse Opera in 1999. Michael Simon will design sets and Petra Reinhardt costumes. Chief conductor Alain Altinoglu will lead a cast that includes Ingela Brimberg as Br\u00fcnnhilde, Magnus Vigilius as Siegfried and Peter Hoare as The Wanderer. The company also announced a pair of world premieres for Peter de Caluwe\u2019s last season as general and artistic director, a tenure that started in 2005. \u201cFanny and Alexander,\u201d by the New York-based composer Mikael Karlsson and librettist Royce Vavrek, based on Ingmar Bergman\u2019s 1982 film, opens Dec. 1 with Ivo van Hove directing a cast that includes Anne Sofie von Otter and Thomas Hampson. \u201cBovary,\u201d based Gustave Flaubert\u2019s 1857 novel \u201cMadame Bovary,\u201d opens next April 12 with music by Harold Noben, a libretto by Michael De Cock and a cast that includes Ana Naqe and Oleg Volkov. Christina Scheppelmann, currently general director of Seattle Opera, will replace de Caluwe in July 2025.",

            "date": "2024-04-20 01:51:00",
            "content": "VENICE, Italy -- Outsider, queer and Indigenous artists are getting an overdue platform at the 60th Venice Biennale contemporary art exhibition that opened Saturday, curated for the first time by a Latin American. Brazilian curator Adriano Pedrosa\u2019s main show, which accompanies 88 national pavilions for the seven-month run, is strong on figurative painting, with fewer installations than recent editions. A preponderance of artists are from the Global South, long overlooked by the mainstream art world circuits. Many are dead. Frida Kahlo, for example, is making her first appearance at the Venice Biennale. Her 1949 painting \u201cDiego and I\u201d hangs alongside one by her husband and fellow artist, Diego Rivera. Despite their lower numbers, living artists have \u201ca much stronger physical presence in the exhibition,\u201d Pedrosa said, with each either showing one large-scale work, or a collection of smaller works. The vast majority are making their Venice Biennale debut. Visitors to the two main venues, the Giardini and the Arsenale, will be greeted by a neon sign by the conceptual art cooperative Claire Fontaine with the exhibition\u2019s title: \u201cStranieri Ovunque \u2014 Foreigners Everywhere.\u201d A total of 60 in different languages hang throughout the venues. When taken in the context of global conflicts and hardening borders, the title seems a provocation against intransigent governments \u2014 at the very least a prod to consider our shared humanity. Through artists with underrepresented perspectives, the exhibition address themes of migration and the nature of diaspora as well as indigeneity and the role of craft. \u201cForeigners everywhere, the expression has many meanings,\u2019\u2019 Pedrosa said. \u201cOne could say that wherever you go, wherever you are, you are always surrounded by foreigners. \u2026 And then in a more personal, perhaps psychoanalytic subjective dimension, wherever you go, you are also a foreigner, deep down inside.\u201d \"Refugee, the foreigner, the queer, the outsider and the Indigenous, these are the ... subjects of interest in the exhibition,'' he said. Some highlights from the Venice Biennale, which runs through Nov. 26: Facing the threat of protests, the Israel Pavilion stayed closed after the artist and curators refused to open until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas -led militants are released. Ukraine is making its second Biennale art appearance as a country under invasion; soft diplomacy aimed at keeping the world focused on the war. Russia has not appeared at the Biennale since the Ukraine invasion began, but this time its historic 110-year-old building in the Giardini is on loan to Bolivia. For a short time during this week\u2019s previews, a printed sign hung on the Accademia Bridge labeling Iran a \u201cmurderous terrorist regime,\u201d declaring \u201cthe Iranian people want freedom & peace.\u201d The venue for the Iranian pavilion was nearby, but there was no sign of activity. The Biennale said it would open Sunday \u2014 two days after the departure from Italy of Group of Seven foreign ministers who warned Iran of sanctions for escalating violence against Israel. The Golden Lion for best national pavilion went to Australia for Archie Moore\u2019s installation \u201ckith and kin,\" tracing his own Aboriginal relations over 65,000 years. It's written in chalk on the pavilion\u2019s dark walls and ceiling and took months to complete. The Mataaho Collective from New Zealand won the Golden Lion for the best participant in Pedrosa's main show, for their installation inspired by Maori weaving that crisscrosses the gallery space, casting a pattern of shadows and interrogating interconnectedness. As a queer artist born in South Korea and working in Los Angeles, Kang Seung Lee said he identified with Pedrosa\u2019s \u201cinvitation to look at our lives as foreigners, but also visitors to this world.\u201d His installation, \u201cUntitled (Constellations),\u201d which considers the artists who died in the AIDS epidemic through a collection of objects, is in dialogue with spare paper-on-canvas works by British artist Romany Eveleigh, who died in 2020. \u201cThe works speak to each other, an intergenerational conversation, of course,\u2019\u2019 said Lee, 45, whose works have been shown in international exhibitions, including Documenta 15. This is his first Venice Biennale. Nearby, transsexual Brazilian artist Manauara Clandestina presented her video \u201cMigranta,\" which speaks about her family\u2019s story of migration. \u201cIt\u2019s so strong, because I can hear my daddy\u2019s voice,\u2019\u2019 she said. Clandestina, who hails from the Amazon city of Manaus, embraced Pedrosa during a press preview marking her Venice debut. She said she continues to work in Brazil despite discrimination and violence against transgender people. The Giardini hosts 29 national pavilions representing some of the oldest participating nations, like the United States, Germany, France and Britain. More recent additions show either in the nearby Arsenale, or choose a venue farther afield, like Nigeria did this year in Venice\u2019s Dorsoduro district. The Nigerian Pavilion, in a long-disused building with raw brick walls that exude potential, houses an exhibition that spans mediums \u2014 including figurative art, installation, sculpture, sound art, film art and augmented reality \u2014 by artists living in the diaspora and in their homeland. \u201cThese different relationships to the country allow for a very unique and different perspectives of Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 said curator Aindrea Emelife. \u201cI think that it\u2019s quite interesting to consider how leaving a space creates a nostalgia for what hasn\u2019t been and allows an artist to imagine an alternative continuation to that. The exhibition is about nostalgia, but it\u2019s also about criticality.\u201d The eight-artist Biennale exhibition \u201cNigeria Imaginary\u201d will travel to the Museum of West African Art in Benin City, Nigeria, where Emelife is curator, which will give it \u201ca new context and a new sense of relevancy,\u2019\u2019 she said. Ghana-born British artist John Akomfrah created eight multimedia film- and sound-based works for the British Pavilion that looks at what it is to be \u201cliving as a figure of difference\u201d in the U.K. Images of water are a connecting device, representing memory. \u201cIn the main, I\u2019m trying to tease out something about collective memory, the things that have informed a culture, British culture let\u2019s say, over the last 50 years,\u2019\u2019 Akomfrah told The Associated Press. \u201cAs you go further in, you realize we\u2019re going further back. We end up going to the 16th century. So it\u2019s an interrogation of 500 years of British life.\u201d Considering the question of equity in the art world, Akomfrah indicated the adjacent French Pavilion \u2014 where French-Caribbean artist Julien Creuzet created an immersive exhibition \u2014 and the Canadian Pavilion on the other side, featuring an exhibition examining the historic importance of seed beads by Kapwani Kiwanga, who is in Paris. \u201cI mean, this feels like a very significant moment for artists of color,\u2019\u2019 said Akomfrah, who participated in the Ghana Pavilion in 2019. \u201cBecause I'm in the British Pavilion. Next to me is the French one, with an artist, Julien, who I love a lot, of African origin. And then next to me is a Canadian pavilion that has a biracial artist, again, with African heritage. \"So that\u2019s certainly not happened before, that three major pavilions have artists of color inhabiting, occupied, making work in them. And that feels like a breakthrough,'' he said. The Ukrainian Pavilion engaged ordinary Ukrainians to collaborate with artists on work that documents how they are experiencing, and in some ways adapting to the Russian invasion. The artistic projects include silent video portraits of European actors styled by Ukrainians displaced by the war to represent an \u201cideal\u201d refugee. In another, neurodiverse young adults show their linguistic flexibility in incorporating a new reality where niceties like \u201cquiet night\u201d have a whole new meaning. And a film installation has become a sort of archive, taken from social media channels that once chronicled pre-invasion pastimes but that turned their attention to documenting the war. Co-curator Max Gorbatskyi said it was important for Ukraine to be present at the Biennale to assert its distinctiveness from Russian culture, but also to use the venue to keep the wider world\u2019s attention. \u201cWe wanted to look at stories of real people,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere was no way we were going to show some abstract paintings, maybe beautiful and interesting, but which only pose questions in the art discourse. Instead, we wanted to bring real people together with artists in a non-hierarchical way to tell their stories.\u201d Greek American George Petrides\u2019 installation \u201cHellenic Heads\u201d outside of Venice\u2019s Church of Saint George of the Greeks and the Museum of Icons is among the many collateral events that spill over into the city. Petrides\u2019 created six oversized busts, each inspired by a significant period of Greek history, using family members as models. His mother, in turquoise blue, is in the classical style and his daughter represents the future in a golden hue. To withstand the weather, Petrides recreated an earlier series but this time from recycled plastic, using a digital sculpting software and a 3D printer, reworking details from hand. \u201cThis space is unique. We have the Museum of Icons here, which is one of the most spectacular collections of icons in the world. We have a church started while Michelangelo was still alive, which any sculptor finds interesting. But further, this particular quarter is the Greek quarter,\u2019\u2019 he said, noting an influx after Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453. Across the city, at the base of the Accademia Bridge, the Qatar Museum's installation \u201cYour Ghosts Are Mine\u201d presents clips of feature films and video art from the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia organized thematically and exploring issues such as migration, conflict and exile. Films will be screened in their entirety four days a week. \u201cThese different thematics tell a story about all the congruences and the parallels that exist among filmmakers that may have never met or are from different parts of the global south,\u2019\u2019 said assistant curator and filmmaker Majid Al-Remaihi. \u201cSome films were the first from their countries to premiere in Cannes or make it to the Oscars, so these are milestones and also part of our journey.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-20 00:18:00",
            "content": "PHOENIX -- Special LP releases, live performances and at least one giant block party are scheduled around the U.S. Saturday as hundreds of shops celebrate Record Store Day during a surge of interest in vinyl and the day after the release of Taylor Swift's latest album. There were no announced Record Store Day specials for the arrival of Swift's \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d on Friday, but her fans always anxiously look forward to the new albums and accompanying collectible LPs. In suburban strip malls and big city downtowns, indie record stores are often the first to recognize and promote emerging artists. Years before Swift was setting Grammy records and selling out concerts in Japan, Bull Moose Music in Portland, Maine, was giving away one of her autographed guitars in an enter-to-win contest. \u201cWe were carrying her music before all the big stores. We always knew she would be a star,\u201d said Chris Brown of employee-owned Bull Moose and a co-founder of Record Store Day. A wave of interest in physical records, especially LPs, has helped keep the independent stores going, Brown said. And LPs have gotten a huge boost from Swift, who has been dubbed the \u201cVinyl Queen\u201d for releases of her work in limited physical record offerings with specialized content and striking covers. The Recording Industry Association of American said in its 2023 year end report that revenues from vinyl records grew 10% to $1.4 billion last year. That was the 17th consecutive year of growth and accounted for 71% of physical format revenues. Record Store Day is a celebration of the estimated 1,400 independent record stores in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide that endure long after the demise of megastores like Tower Records. While most people stream their music on services such as Spotify and Apple Music, old-school LPs remain popular for collectors who prefer the packaging and the listening experience of records. \u201cFor me, records sound better than any CD,\u201d said Michael Iffland, a 70-year-old retiree who was considering some Beatles singles at the Tracks in Wax record store in Phoenix. \u201cIt's just cool having a record in your hand, looking at the cover graphics and listening to that wonderful sound.\u201d Owners and employees of the independent stores came up with the idea at a gathering in 2007 as a way to draw attention to their unique culture on the third Saturday of April. The first Record Store Day was on April 19, 2008, and cities around the U.S. later declared the celebration an official holiday, including New York City, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. \u201cFor us, records have never gone out of style,\u201d said Waric Cameron, co-owner of Josey Records in Dallas. \u201cIt's the biggest day of the year for us,\u201d added his business partner, Luke Sardello. \u201cIt's like the Super Bowl of record stores.\u201d Jamal Alnasr, owner of Village Revival Records in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village, called Record Store Day \u201cone of my biggest money growers of the year. People even camp outside the night before.\u201d Record Store Day is typically marked by special vinyl and CD releases and various promotional products and events featuring artists and labels. Metallica spent hours on the first Record Store Day meeting fans at Rasputin Music in the San Francisco Bay area. Jesse \u201cBoots Electric\u201d Hughes of Eagles of Death Metal was declared a Record Store Day ambassador in 2009 and a string of other artists followed in subsequent years, including Ozzy Osbourne, Iggy Pop, Jack White, Fred Armisen, as well as Swift in 2022. There were 387 planned releases announced for this year's Record Store Day. Paramore, the event's 2024 ambassador, will have a pair of physical releases of the digital album that featured celebrity remixes from songs on its 2023 \u201cThis is Why\u201d album. Rock band Pearl Jam will release 15,000 copies of a \u201cDark Matter\u201d LP, with a ghostly black and yellow cover. Icelandic-American traditional pop singer Laufey will offer up 4,200 copies of \u201cA Night at the Symphony,\u201d a live album recorded in Reykjav\u00edk with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra. In some cases, the record itself will serve as a canvas. Death Cab for Cutie will release 2,500 copies of its \u201cLive at the Showbox\u201d on pink marble vinyl. Fleetwood Mac will have a limited edition of its hugely popular \u201cRumours,\u201d still a top seller since its 1977 release, with a photograph of the album cover featuring Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood stamped on the vinyl. \u201cPeople get really excited and look forward to the releases,\u201d said Tracks in Wax owner Tim Stamper, who always orders a few. \u201cIt's more important for us than Christmas.\u201d Jeff Maimon, 38, who was in the store on a visit from Chicago, said Record Store Day \u201cwas always a very special day. It's all about the excitement of standing outside and waiting in line to see what kind of specials you can get.\u201d A giant block party with 14 live performances is planned Saturday at Vinyl Tap in Nashville, Tennessee, owner Todd Hedrick said. The performers will include Lzzy and Joe of Halestorm and The Watson Twins. \u201cWe'll shut down the street, bring in five or six food trucks,\u201d along with about 25 vendors, Hedrick said. \u201cAnd it coincides with our other favorite holiday, 4/20,\u201d Hedrick added, referring to marijuana-oriented celebrations held annually on April 20. Swift, who is credited by fans and record stores alike with igniting new interest in vinyl LPs, has not announced any special releases for this Record Store Day. The hugely popular Swift set a new record this year when she won a fourth album of the year award at the Grammy Awards for \u201cMidnights.\u201d She previously had been tied with Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon with three albums. Swift\u2019s re-recorded \u201c1989 (Taylor's Version)\u201d last year became the first album to sell more than 1 million vinyl LPs within a calendar year in the U.S. Her \u201cMidnights\u201d album in 2022 became the first major album release to have its vinyl sales outpace CDs since 1987. ___ AP video journalist Kendria LaFleur in Dallas contributed reporting.",

            "date": "2024-04-20 00:01:00",
            "content": "It's July 1976 in a Northern California recording studio and the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band cutting their latest album is exhausted and wary. The coffee machine is broken. Never mind, there's always cocaine \u2014 and heaps of it. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d one of the musicians says. \"It\u2019s the exact same thing,\" she is told. So begins \u201cStereophonic,\u201d one of the most thrilling pieces of theater in years, a play with better songs than most musicals on Broadway and an ensemble that rocks, literally. You won't need any of their coke to last the three-hour-plus run time. Playwright David Adjmi tells the story of a Fleetwood Mac-like band with five members \u2014 some married, some dating \u2014 working on music with two sound engineers over a life-changing year, with personal rifts opening and closing and then reopening. The riffs also change, as songs endure dozens of takes and changes in tempo. The play, which opened Friday at the Golden Theatre, is a hypernaturalistic meditation on the thrill, and also the danger, of collaborating on art \u2014 the compromises, the egos and the joys. It's an ode not just to the music business but perhaps to the theater world, too. \u201cStereophonic\u201d is a very human play, featuring deep moments about love and the pursuit of art interspliced with digressions about dry cleaners and Marlon Brando. We learn to care about each of the five characters and even anticipate their reactions. Will they survive this album intact? David Zinn's marvelous set, with the engineers manipulating dials and faders in the office-hangout spot, in front of a glassed-off recording space, allows for multiple conversations at once, including one intense argument completely offstage that the engineers overhear. The effect is almost to turn the actors into instruments themselves, alternating silence for one or two moments in one scene and in another with their volumes raised high. There is cross-talk, mufflers and even the clunk of machines whirring when a recording is started. It's the most interesting soundscape since \u201cThe Humans.\u201d Kudos to director Daniel Aukin and the nimble cast for making it all so seamless. Will Butler, formerly of Arcade Fire, provides the original, layered blues- and folk-based songs \u2014 perfect for progressive rockers in the late \u201870s. The songs are instantly funky, head-bobbing bangers and audience members will care about them, too. (What happens to them at the play's end is a twist.) An existential angst hangs over this recording studio in Sausalito, California. Long hours in the studio mean the inhabitants lose track of time. They work into the wee hours, forgetting what day they're in. \u201cWhat month is this?\u201d one asks. Outside the studio, we learn this unnamed band is getting famous, but inside there is no escape from microaggressions, breakups and perfectionist demands, all amplified by substance abuse. The two women in the band \u2014 keyboardists and singers played by Sarah Pidgeon and Juliana Canfield \u2014 learn to stick up for themselves over the course of the play, while the men \u2014 the bassist played by Will Brill and a drummer by Chris Stack \u2014 rebel against the dictatorial singer-guitarist, played by Tom Pecinka. Eli Gelb and Andrew R. Butler play the hapless engineers with increasing self-confidence. Adjmi writes the awful, push-pull fights of couples brilliantly: \u201cJust because I don\u2019t unravel the thread doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d one women says to her partner. He also captures with accuracy and wit a scene in which three guys have a random, pot-fueled discussion about houseboats. Pidgeon's character, Diana, a budding and gifted singer-songwriter, reveals a profound insecurity, one not helped by her coolly demanding band leader and lover. \u201cI can\u2019t be a rock star and be this stupid,\u201d she says.

            "date": "2024-04-19 19:15:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- Video cameras stationed outside the Manhattan courthouse where former President Donald Trump is on trial caught the gruesome scene Friday of a man who lit himself on fire and the aftermath as authorities tried to rescue him. CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC were all on the air with reporters talking about the seating of a jury when the incident happened and other news agencies, including The Associated Press, were livestreaming from outside the courthouse. The man, who distributed pamphlets before dousing himself in an accelerant and setting himself on fire, was taken to a hospital where he later died. The incident tested how quickly the networks could react, and how they decided what would be too disturbing for their viewers to see. With narration from Laura Coates, CNN had the most extensive view of the scene. Coates, who at first incorrectly said it was a shooting situation, then narrated as the man was visible onscreen, enveloped in flames. \u201cYou can smell burning flesh,\u201d Coates, an anchor and CNN's chief legal analyst, said as she stood at the scene with reporter Evan Perez. The camera switched back and forth between Coates and what was happening in the park. Five minutes after the incident started, CNN posted the onscreen message \u201cWarning: Graphic Content.\u201d Coates later said she couldn\u2019t \u201coverstate the emotional response of watching a human being engulfed in flames and to watch his body be lifted into a gurney.\u201d She described it as an \u201cemotional and unbelievably disturbing moment here.\u201d Fox's cameras caught the scene briefly as reporter Eric Shawn talked, then the network switched to a courtroom sketch of Trump on trial. \u201cWe deeply apologize for what has happened,\u201d Shawn said. On MSNBC, reporter Yasmin Vossoughian narrated the scene. The network showed smoke in the park, but no picture where the body was visible. \u201cI could see the outline of his body inside the flames,\u201d Vossoughian said, \u201cwhich was so terrifying to see. As he went to the ground his knees hit the ground first.\u201d The AP had a camera with an unnarrated live shot stationed outside the courthouse, shown on YouTube and APNews.com. The cameras caught an extensive view, with the man lighting himself afire and later writhing on the ground before a police officer tried to douse the flames with a jacket. The AP later removed its live feed from its YouTube channel and replaced it with a new one because of the graphic nature of the content. The news agency distributed carefully edited clips to its video clients \u2014 not showing the moment the man lit himself on fire, for example, said executive producer Tom Williams. Julien Gorbach, a University of Hawaii at Manoa associate professor of journalism, said news organizations didn't face much of a dilemma about whether to show the footage because there was little for the public to gain by seeing images of a man lighting himself on fire. The episode highlights how fast information travels and the importance of critical thinking, Gorbach said. \u201cIt outpaces our ability to a) sort out the facts, and b) do the kind of methodical, critical thinking that we need to do so that we understand the truth of what actually this incident was all about,\u201d Gorbach said. The location of the incident may have prompted some to think the self-immolation was related to the trial. Gorbach, who was listening to MSNBC on satellite radio when it happened, said the coverage he heard was careful to question whether there was any connection to the trial. It also raised the possibility the man may have wanted to get media attention. News organizations can't suppress the news just so the public doesn't get confused, he said. Word would get out regardless as non-journalists post accounts online. \u201cSo it\u2019s really a test of us as a public,\u201d he said. ___ Associated Press writer Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 17:45:00",
            "content": "LAS VEGAS -- Phish opened its four-night stay at the Sphere Thursday with a four-hour show that used the advanced technology in the $2.3 billion arena to deliver a show that even the band's most ardent fans have never experienced before. \u201cWe came in really wanting to do a show that was a great Phish show,\u201d said Abigail Rosen Holmes, who is running the visual show. She said the band and its creative team wanted to mix the Sphere\u2019s technical capabilities and consider \u201cwhat can we do for Phish that we maybe couldn\u2019t do for any other artist?\u201d Here\u2019s how Phish is creating a set of shows that even fans who\u2019ve seen the band perform hundreds of times won\u2019t have experienced before. While Phish shows usually get their visual punch from lighting guru Chris Kuroda\u2019s massive lighting rig, these shows are completely different as the band uses custom visuals on the 160,000-square foot 16K-by-16K LED screen. Three-dimensional blue bars moving and spinning in time and growing to meet beams of light falling from the ceiling. Live video of the band playing, cut into pieces. A wall of psychedelic-colored cars blinking their lights with a long improvisational jam. Easter eggs from Phish\u2019s history \u2014 like the vacuum cleaner drummer Jon Fishman sometimes plays \u2014 falling from the ceiling. A naturescape that then morphs into a fantasy world. Holmes sits in the center of the arena controlling the visuals in real-time, mixing the elements created with Montreal-based entertainment studio Moment Factory to match the band\u2019s performance. Kuroda sits beside her, using six light towers behind the stage plus spotlights to find the right moments to bring people back to the band on stage. Toward the end of Thursday night\u2019s show, Kuroda started to spotlight individual members of the band, sending a simple black silhouette onto the wall. The silhouette then burst into a reddened field of 20 silhouettes throughout the arena. There are 1,600 permanent speakers, along with 300 mobile speaker modules, that use a 3D audio beamforming and wave field synthesis technology to spread sound throughout the venue. The system allows for individual instruments to be heard from different parts of the arena. \u201cIt\u2019s like pinpoints of sound and thousands and thousands of them,\u201d says Phish\u2019s Trey Anastasio. There are 17,500 seats inside the Sphere, every one of which will be filled with a Phish fan this week, along with about 2,500 standing on the floor. The seats use haptic technology, so every bass line and drum kick from the band can be felt from your chair \u2014 for those actually sitting and not standing up and dancing. U2 performed 40 shows to open the Sphere. Phish sold out its four shows this week within minutes and considered doing more, but decided they wanted to create four unique visual and music experiences to match the band\u2019s history of never repeating the same show twice. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we could have done it any other way,\u201d said Page McConnell, Phish\u2019s piano/organ/keyboard player. \u201cWe do it for us. We do it for the audience. It keeps it interesting for us and it keeps it interesting for them. And it\u2019s what people like about us.\u201d There are 1.2 million LED \u201cpucks\u201d that make up the 580,000-square feet exosphere, each of which can display more than 1 billion colors. The display has become an instant tourist attraction in Las Vegas, seen from hotel rooms around the Strip and from planes above. It cycles through various funky visuals, including a giant yellow blinking smiley face and a furry creature. This week it includes a digital billboard for Phish.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 17:40:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- Jonathan Tetelman transformed from a nightclub DJ to an international opera star, a music detour that was quite, well, operatic. He stopped singing in 2011 and mixed music for New York's clubbers at Webster Hall, Pacha, Greenhouse and W.i.P. These days, the 35-year-old\u2019s gigs are at posher places such as London\u2019s Royal Opera House and the Salzburg Festival. His career revived by a transition to tenor from baritone, Tetelman will be featured as Ruggero in a Metropolitan Opera performance of Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Rondine (The Swallow)\u201d with soprano Angel Blue, televised live to theaters worldwide Saturday. Starting April 26, he sings Pinkerton in \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d opposite soprano Asmik Grigorian in her Met debut. \u201cI kept saying to people, \u2018You know, I\u2019m a DJ, but I\u2019m actually an opera singer.' And the more I said it, the more I was like: \u2019Am I really an opera singer?'\u201d Tetelman recalled of his singing sabbatical. So he gave himself six months. \u201cI just sold everything. I sold all my equipment. All my speakers, all my turntables \u2014 everything \u2014 and just focused,\u201d he said. Born in Chile, Tetelman was adopted at about 7 months and grew up in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. He got a degree from the Manhattan School of Music in 2011 and considered himself a baritone. Tetelman moved on to the Mannes School of Music for a graduate program where he was told his upper register was his future but struggled with even audition standards. Overcome with frustration, he headed to the downtown nightlife scene in 2013. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t clicking. I threw it all away,\u201d he said. After concluding that club life wasn\u2019t a future, Tetelman began listening to recordings of Luciano Pavarotti, Enrico Caruso, Franco Corelli and Jonas Kaufmann to understand how they used their voices. Working with Mark Schnaible and Patricia McCaffrey, a husband-and-wife vocal coach team, he began building his tenor technique in 2015. \u201cThis young man is wildly talented,\u201d Schnaible said. By his mid-20s, Tetelman thought himself too old for professional training programs, so he found an agent. He sang Eisenstein in Johann Strauss II\u2019s \u201cDie Fledermaus (The Bat)\u201d at the Martina Arroyo Foundation\u2019s young artists program in 2016. He then paid a few hundred dollars to attend an open call casting audition. That led to the role of Rodolfo in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d at the Fujian Grand Theatre in China in 2017. He was hired for \u201cBoh\u00e8me\u201d in November 2018 at the English National Opera, where all performances are in English. Tetelman prepared by singing in \u201cLa Boheme Warhola\u201d \u2014 an adaptation of the classic that shifts to Andy Warhol\u2019s The Factory studio \u2014 with Pittsburgh Festival Opera at the Falk Auditorium, a 360-seat school theater. Around the same time, agent Alan Green arranged for Tetelman to take over Rodolfo for a concert performance at the Boston Symphony Orchestra\u2019s Tanglewood Festival after Piotr Becza\u0142a withdrew to replace Roberto Alagna at the Bayreuth Festival\u2019s \u201cLohengrin.\u201d That raised Tetelman\u2019s profile before he headed to the London Coliseum for the revival of Jonathan Miller\u2019s 2009 staging, a key accelerant of his career. \"The production and the theater are wonderful. \u2018La Boh\u00e8me\u2019 in English is disgusting,\u201d Tetelman recalled vividly. A dashing 6-foot-4 with dark hair and a wide smile, he became an in-demand singer for Puccini. \u201cHe has a very solid top. When he sings soft, which I always encourage, especially in the very intimate moments, there\u2019s a tenderness,\u201d conductor Speranza Scappucci said. On the night of Tetelman\u2019s Met debut on March 26, an audience member tossed a bouquet he caught on the fly. \"He\u2019s certainly a very, very charismatic presence and the audiences are responding,\u201d Met general manager Peter Gelb said. Tetelman made his Salzburg Festival debut last summer in Krzysztof Warlikowski\u2019s \u201cMacbeth.\u201d The staging opened in an obstetrician\u2019s office with children wearing black and yellow patches warning of radiation. \u201cYou had to be on like mushrooms or something to really understand it,\u201d Tetelman said, quickly adding, \u201cIt was one of the most amazing experiences I\u2019ve had. ... I think working with him was actually a really inspiring moment for me.\u201d Future roles include Turiddu in Mascagni\u2019s \u201cCavalleria Rusticana\u201d and a title role in Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019 \u201cSamson et Dalila\u201d along with the heavier Puccini parts of Dick Johnson in \u201cLa Fanciulla del West (Girl of the Golden West)\u201d and des Grieux in \u201cManon Lescaut.\u201d He\u2019d like to take on Strauss\u2019 Apollo in \u201cDaphne\u201d and Bacchus in \u201cAriadne auf Naxos\" one day. \u201cI\u2019m trying to book actually less and less Puccini just because I\u2019ve booked so much,\u201d Tetelman said.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 16:44:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Taylor Swift has released her 11th studio album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d But just how poetic is it? Is it even possible to close read lyrics like poems, divorced from their source material? The Associated Press spoke to four experts to assess how Swift's latest album stacks up to poetry. Allison Adair, a professor who teaches poetry and other literary forms at Boston College, says yes. \u201cMy personal opinion is that if someone writes poems and considers themself a poet, then they\u2019re a poet,\" she says. \u201cAnd Swift has demonstrated that she takes it pretty seriously. She's mentioned (Pablo) Neruda in her work before, she has an allusion to (William) Wordsworth, she cites Emily Dickinson as one of her influences.\u201d She also said her students told her Swift's B-sides \u2014 not her radio singles \u2014 tend to be her most poetic, which is true of poets, too. \u201cTheir most well-known poems are the ones that people lock into the most, that are the clearest, and in a way, don\u2019t always have the mystery of poetry.\u201d Professor Elizabeth Scala, who teaches a course on Swift\u2019s songbook at the University of Texas at Austin, says \u201cthere is something poetical about the way she writes,\u201d adding that her work on \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d references a time before print technology when people sang poems. \u201cIn the earliest stages of English poetry, they were inseparable,\u201d she says. \u201cNot absolutely identical, but they have a long and rich history together that is re-energized by Taylor Swift.\u201d \u201cIt's proper to talk about every songwriter as a poet,\u201d says Michael Chasar, a poetry and popular culture professor at Willamette University. \u201cThere are many things musicians and singer-songwriters can do that poetry cannot,\u201d Adair says, citing melisma, or the ability to hold out a single syllable over many notes, as an example. Or the nature of a song with uplifting production and morose lyricism, which can create a confusing and rich texture. \u201cThat's something music can do viscerally and poetry has to do in different ways.\u201d \u201cShe might say her works are poetry,\u201d adds Scala. \u201cBut I also think the music is so important \u2014 kind of poetry-plus.\u201d As for current U.S. poet laureate Ada Lim\u00f3n? \u201cPoetry and song lyrics aren\u2019t exactly the same (we poets have to make all our music with only words and breath),\u201d she wrote to the AP. \"But having an icon like Taylor bring more attention to poetry as a genre is exciting.\u201d Scala sees Swift's influences on \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d as including Sylvia Plath, a confessional poet she previously drew inspiration from on songs like \u201cMad Woman\u201d and \u201cTolerate It.\u201d \u201cFortnight\u201d uses enjambed lines (there's no end stop, or punctuation at the end of each line) and Scala points out the dissonance between the music's smoothness and its lyrics, like in the line \u201cMy mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February.\u201d \u201cIt kind of encapsulates boredom with the ordinary and then she unleashes a kind of tension and anger in the ordinary in those verses,\" she says. In the verses, she says Swift \u201cexplodes the domestic,\u201d and that fights up against the music, which is \u201cliterary.\u201d Swift's lyrics, too, allow for multi-dimensional readings: \u201cI touched you\" could be physicality and infidelity in the song, Scala says, or it could mean it emotionally \u2014 as in, I moved you. Swift has long played with rhyme and unexpected rhythm. \u201cShe\u2019ll often establish a pattern and won't satisfy it \u2014 and that often comes in a moment of emotional ache,\" says Adair. On \u201cFortnight,\u201d it appears in a few ways. Adair points out that the chorus is more syncopated than the rest of the song \u2014 which means Swift uses many more syllables for the same beat. \u201cIt gives this rushed quality,\u201d she says. \u201cRhyming \u2018alcoholic\u2019 and \u2018aesthetic,\u2019 she plays a lot with assonance. It is technically a vowel-driven repetition of sounds,\u201d she adds. There's a tension, too, in the title \u201cFortnight,\u201d an archaic term used for a song with contemporary devices. \u201cThere\u2019s an allusion to treason, and some of the stuff is hyper romantic, but a lot of it is very much a kind of unapologetic, plain speech. And there's something poetic about that.\u201d \u201cFrom the perspective of harnessing particular poetic devices, this kind of trucks in familiar metaphors for one\u2019s emotional state,\u201d Chasar says of \u201cFortnight.\u201d He says the speaker is \u201carrested in the past and a future that could've been,\" using a dystopic image of American suburbs as a metaphor and \u201ccultivating a sense of numbness, which we hear in the intonation of the lyrics.\u201d \u201cBut the speaker is so overwhelmed by their emotional state that they can\u2019t think of any other associations with politically charged lyrics like \u2018treason\u2019 and \u2018Florida\u2019 and \u2018lost in America\u2019 that many of us would,\" he says. The title \u201cFortnight,\u201d he adds, \u201cis totally poetic. It's also a period of 14 days, or two weeks. For most of us \u2018lost in America,\u2019 it means a paycheck.\" \u201cShe's making references to Greek mythology,\u201d say Scala, like in \u201cCassandra,\" which is part of a surprise set of songs Swift dropped Friday. The title references the daughter of king of Troy, who foretold the city's destruction but had been cursed so that no one believed her. \"She\u2019s the truth teller. No one wants to believe, and no one can believe,\u201d she says. Swift is \u201cthinking in terms of literary paradigms about truth telling.\u201d Adair looks to \"So Long, London\": from the chiming, high school harmonies that open it to a plain first verse, \u201cquiet and domestic,\u201d she says. \u201cThat mismatch is very poetic, because it\u2019s pairing things from two different tonal registers, essentially, and saying they both have value, and they belong together: The kind of high mindedness and the high tradition and the kind of casual every day. That\u2019s something the Beat poets did too, re-redefining the relationship between the sacred and profane.\u201d ___ AP National Writer Hillel Italie contributed to this report.",

            "content": "PHOENIX -- A small blue dog with an Australian accent has captured the hearts of people across the world. She's the title character of \u201cBluey,\u201d a kids' program consisting of seven-minute episodes that have enraptured children and adults alike. This week's release of its longest episode yet \u2014 at a whopping 28 minutes \u2014 prompted an outpouring of appreciation for the show, even from those who are neither toddler nor parent. \u201cBluey\u201d follows an Australian blue heeler who, along with her sister (a red heeler named Bingo), navigates the days between home and school. It's a favorite among children for its playful humor, but it also appeals to adults reminiscing about childhood. \u201cMy childhood experience wasn't the greatest so I've always resonated with shows where life is good,\u201d says Miriam Neel, who lives in Colorado. \u201cThe parents in \u2018Bluey\u2019 enable imagination and creativity and really get involved with their kids, and I wish I had those experiences.\u201d Neel is 32 and has chosen not to have any children of her own. She says the show has become part of her morning routine and is often a go-to choice for background noise when she is working from home. \u201cI'm not going to speak for the entire generation, but millennials find comfort in cartoons. It's what a lot of us grew up watching,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if I'm going to spend time watching something I'd rather watch something that doesn't make me afraid of the world, like any of the \u2018Law & Order\u2019 shows.\u201d \u201cBluey,\u201d which now boasts more than 150 episodes, premiered in Australia in 2018 and began streaming on Disney+ in 2020. It also has been adapted into a digital series where famous fans like Bindi Irwin and Eva Mendes read some of the popular storybooks, and a live theater show that travels around the world. The show has also won multiple awards, including the Australian Film Institute Award for best children\u2019s television drama every year since 2019 and an International Emmy Kids Award. The series provides a child's perspective into morning routines, errands and chores, while also giving viewers a glimpse of what life is like for parents through mother Chilli and father Bandit. This week's special episode, \u201cThe Sign,\u201d explores the emotions surrounding themes that resonate with both children and adults \u2014 moving houses, marriage, infertility and relationships after divorce. In addition to these universal themes, the episode wraps up the third season with Easter eggs for dedicated fans. Lindsey Schmidt, 40, says the show's continuity keeps her family looking forward to more. \u201cThere are so many callbacks to previous episodes,\u201d says Schmidt, who lives in Ohio with her husband and three children. \u201cThe shows that we watch with our kids regularly don\u2019t reflect our lives like this show does. These anthropomorphic dogs feel just like us.\" But there are mixed feelings about the ending of the episode \u2014 SPOILER \u2014 in which the Heeler family scraps their move. Some families who relocate often for work found it unrealistic. Meg Korzon, 31, is in the process of a cross-country relocation with her four children because her husband is in the military. It's her seventh move in 10 years. \u201cI was hoping it would be an episode that aligned itself with the realities of life, our lives, as a military family,\u201d she says. \u201cI was selfishly disappointed because it could have been an episode about change and growth.\" But the show does not shy away from other difficult topics \u2014 and that is part of the charm for adults as well. \u201cAs a parent you aspire to be as good of parents as Chilli and Bandit are as parents. They always have a great way of talking kids through issues,\u201d Schmidt's 40-year-old husband John says, adding that the couple often refers back to episodes when trying to explain things to their children. The series has touched on topics of aging, death and making friends as an adult. It also has introduced a character who uses sign language and another with ADHD. Jacqueline Nesi, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, notes that \u201cBluey\u201d promotes self-regulation and conflict resolution for children and engaged parenting and patience for adults. \u201cWe see them working through some of the challenges that we, as parents, might be facing, too. And at the same time, they offer a nice model for different parenting skills \u2014 asking open-ended questions to facilitate kids\u2019 creativity, using natural consequences when they misbehave, actively playing with them and letting them take the lead,\u201d she says. The show has also done a lot to expose children to the world of animation, flaunting different styles in the episodes \u201cEscape\u201d and \u201cDragon,\u201d providing a near-voiceless episode in \u201cRain,\u201d and breaching the fourth wall in \u201cPuppets,\u201d where the show stops briefly to zoom out on the creation of just a couple seconds of animated frames. It's also credited with appealing to dogs \u2014 and not because the characters are the same species. Research has said dogs have vision similar to red-green color blindness in humans, meaning their color spectrum is limited to blue, yellow, brown and shades of gray \u2014 which happen to be the colors of the Heeler family. There were more pets named Bluey, Bingo, Chilli and Bandit across the U.S. last year, too, according to Rover. So it's fairly safe to say \u201cBluey\u201d has appeal across species, as well as generations. \u201cI used to tell people what do \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019 \u2018The Wire\u2019 and \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 have in common? They all have lower IMDb scores than Bluey. It used to anyway. I watched all these great shows, but I think \u2018Bluey\u2019 is still a favorite, maybe because I have kids. But I put it right up there with all of them,\u201d John Schmidt says, admitting that he and his wife have watched the episodes without their children. Schmidt says the episode tied a nice bow to end the season, and would be a perfect series finale otherwise. \u201cI get emotional about the potential of Bluey no longer having new episodes,\u201d says Schmidt. \u201cBut we'll see.\u201d",

The fire Thursday night was confined to the roof and attic of the lodge, 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Portland, and it may have been caused by embers from the large stone fireplace, the lodge said in a Facebook post. Damage appeared \u201csomewhat minimal,\u201d it said. \u201cTimberline employees, Hoodland Fire, Clackamas County and Gresham first responders did an amazing job,\u201d the lodge said. \u201cThe process, communication and containment saved the Historic Timberline Lodge from what could have been a much worse outcome.\u201d No injuries were reported.

            "content": "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kit Harington jumped at the chance to sport what he calls a \u201cproper porn \u2018stache\" to play a drug-running killer in \u201cBlood for Dust.\u201d The \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor \u2014 who confirmed a Jon Snow-centered sequel is on ice \u2014 stars in the new film alongside Scoot McNairy and Josh Lucas. It hits theaters and digital this week. Harington, 37, will also play a role in the third season of HBO\u2019s finance drama \u201cIndustry,\u201d expected to air later this year. He spoke to The Associated Press recently about trusting directors, joining the shows cast and how his facial hair helped explain his character. Answers have been edited for clarity and brevity. HARINGTON: I think a lot of this is a sort of personality gauge business where you meet the director and you hear his or her vision for it. And with (director Rod Blackhurst) I definitely felt that I was in safe hands, and it turned out I was. He had really thought this thing out. I saw that and felt that he was going to be able to deliver on what I thought was a classic story, but quite a well-told sort of American neo-Western. HARINGTON: Yeah, I think that\u2019s kind of Ricky to have a proper porn 'stache. It\u2019s a statement thing and it says everything about him. That he\u2019s sort of all appearance and show. It says quite a lot about the character. I knew there\u2019s gonna be very few times I was going to be able to have a handlebar mustache in something, so I jumped at the chance. HARINGTON: We all, in life, have glimpsed through the curtain and seen this world. I\u2019m always sort of fascinated by what a character is addicted to. What drives him? In some ways, Scoot\u2019s character is not innocent in this movie. He gets drawn back to his old addictions and the art of this movie, and the skill of it that Rod manages to get across, is that we kind of forgive him all of that. Because we look this way at Ricky. We look this way at these guys. But we forgive this guy for what he\u2019s doing and his part of that. HARINGTON: Ricky is the hero in his own movie, and I think he\u2019s the one who sees it in this guy. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re not so different from me. Don\u2019t pretend that you are. Just come with me and enjoy the ride.\u201d We spoke about that a lot, like Ricky is dragging him back into this. Back into this story, back into this world, because he\u2019s like, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to get out. I\u2019m going to make sure we go for one last kick-ass ride in this, and I\u2019m going to take you with me.\u201d It\u2019s that kind of mentality. HARINGTON: I love that show. I kind of came into it as a bit of a fanboy. And that\u2019s a strange thing for me, because I\u2019d always been in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d where people would come in and they\u2019d be fans of the show. This time I was coming in as this older actor and as a fan of their show. It was really exciting. It\u2019s just brilliant. The first episode is just mesmerizing and you\u2019re straight back in it. I just think it\u2019s one of the most unique, interesting, tonally exciting pieces out there. HARINGTON: I\u2019ve watched the first two episodes now and I\u2019m thoroughly enjoying it. I really am. It took me all of my courage to sit down and watch other people speaking their words. It took a certain amount of courage to do that in a weird sort of way. But once I was in that, I was like, \u201cOh, these lucky actors, these brilliant writers!\u201d and I love it.",

Like \u201cBarracuda,\u201d a sonic burst which first appeared on the band\u2019s second album, \u201cLittle Queen\u201d and is one of the band\u2019s most memorable songs. \u201cYou can\u2019t mess with \u2018Barracuda.\u2019 It\u2019s just the way it is. It is great. You get on the horse and you ride. It\u2019s a galloping steed of a ride to go on. And for everybody, including the band.\" The tour kicks off Saturday at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, and will hit cities including Atlanta, Boston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Detroit, as well as the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado. International dates include stops in London, Oslo, Berlin, Stockholm, Montreal and Glasgow. The band's Royal Flush Tour will have Cheap Trick as the opening act for many stops, but Def Leppard and Journey will join for three stadium dates in Cleveland, Toronto and Boston this summer. Ann and Nancy Wilson will be filled out by Ryan Wariner (lead and rhythm guitar), Ryan Waters (guitars), Paul Moak (guitars, keyboards and backing vocals), Tony Lucido (bass and backing vocals) and Sean T. Lane (drums). The tour is the first in several years for Heart, which was rocked by a body blow in 2016 when Ann Wilson\u2019s husband was arrested for assaulting Nancy\u2019s 16-year-old twin sons. Nancy Wilson says that's all in the past. \u201cWe can take any kind of turbulence, me and Ann, and we\u2019ve always been OK together,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re still steering the ship and happy to do it together. So we\u2019re tight.\u201d The new tour will take them to Canada, which was warm to the band when they were starting out as what Nancy Wilson calls \u201ca couple of chicks from Seattle.\u201d She recalls Vancouver embracing Heart, and touring in one van across Canada in the dead of winter on two lane highways. The Wilson sisters broke rock's glass ceiling in the '70s and Nancy Wilson says they only had male influences to look to, like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Moody Blues. Now she says she looks out and loves seeing generations of female rockers. \u201cYou have boygenius and you have Billie Eilish and you have Olivia Rodrigo and so many amazing women \u2014 Maggie Rogers and Sheryl Crow, who calls us her big influence. And then Billie Eilish might have Sheryl Crow as her influence. So it\u2019s a really nice legacy to pass along. I like to say we\u2019re the OG \u2014 the original gangsters \u2014 of women and rock.\u201d Heart has made it into the Rock Hall, won Grammys, sold millions of albums and rocked hundreds of thousands of fans but Nancy Wilson has one place she'd still like to shine. Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of their debut album, \u201cDreamboat Annie,\u201d which was the same year that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d started. \u201cSo we\u2019re actually kind of putting it out there \u2014 Heart never played on \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019 But what about the 50th birthday party with Heart?\u201d ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",

The movie is about two young singles whose magical one-night stand ends in miscommunication and hurt feelings, and then find themselves both in a small family wedding party and staying in the same house. It\u2019s loosely based on Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cMuch Ado About Nothing.\u201d Reviews were mixed and the box office started out tame, but it became a slow burn sleeper hit in theaters, earning more than $218 million worldwide.

Is it great cinema? Probably not, but everyone who watches it seems to have a fun time (in spite of themselves). Entertainment Weekly\u2019s Leah Greenblatt wrote in her review that, \u201cThis is not the morose, carnage-soaked horror of dank basements and clammy night terrors; most of the movie happens in bright daylight, every maniacal head tilt, ungodly hip swivel, and murder-by-gardening-tool calibrated for screams that end not with a gasp but a giggle.

Enter Eve, a sword- and gun-wielding warrior who has returned to her home planet to help out the few people left, including a scavenger named Adam. The Biblical references pile up \u2014 for example, the last city standing is Xion \u2014 but the real influence is the popular hack-and-slash epic Bayonetta. If you\u2019ve been craving another flamboyant adventure with a beautiful woman battling hideous beasts, Korean studio Shift Up hopes it\u2019s got you covered. Start swinging Friday, April 26, on PlayStation 5. \u2014 Electronic Arts\u2019 Tales of Kenzera: Zau is less campy and more down to earth. Its protagonist, Zau, aims to become a healer and, maybe, bring his father back from the Land of the Dead. The aspiring shaman has some nifty parkour skills as well as sun and moon masks, which allow him to, respectively, launch spears and manipulate time as he fights evil spirits. Tales of Kenzera is the debut title from Surgent Studios, which was founded by voice actor Abubakar Salim, and he says it was inspired by Bantu folklore as well as his own experience with grief.

            "date": "2024-04-19 11:22:00",
            "content": "MECHANICSBURG, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania school board's cancellation of an upcoming appearance by actor and children\u2019s book author Maulik Pancholy was ill-advised and sends a hurtful message, especially to the LGBTQ + community, education officials said. A member of Cumberland Valley School District\u2019s board cited concerns about what he described as Pancholy's activism and \u201clifestyle\u201d before the board voted unanimously Monday to cancel his appearance at a May 22 assembly at the Mountain View Middle School. Pancholy, who is gay, was scheduled to speak against bullying. Besides their concerns about Pancholy, some board members also noted the district\u2019s policy about not hosting overtly political events, news outlets reported. The policy was enacted after the district was criticized for hosting a rally by Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign for president. District Superintendent Mark Blanchard and nine other senior leaders \u2014 including assistant superintendents and district-level directors of technology, curriculum, legal affairs, human resources, student services and special education \u2014 sent a letter to the board, faculty and staff on Thursday asserting that Pancholy's speech should have been allowed. Pancholy's representatives shared a copy of the letter with The Associated Press. The education officials said they were not given \u201ca real opportunity\u201d to answer questions or provide guidance about the event, which they said was aimed at reinforcing the importance of treating all people equally. The administrators added that the school board's decision had \"significant ramifications for our school community, especially for our students and staff who are members of the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d They also noted that the actor's sexual identity was cited as a factor in the decision, meaning \"Mr. Pancholy\u2019s personhood was reduced to a single aspect, and his ability to communicate a message of anti-bullying and hate was discredited.\u201d The Associated Press sent emails to individual school board members seeking comment Friday. Pancholy, 48, is an award-winning actor, including for his roles on the television shows \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cWeeds,\u201d and as the voice of Baljeet in the Disney animated series, \u201cPhineas & Ferb.\u201d He also has written children\u2019s books and in 2014 was named by then-President Barack Obama to serve on the President\u2019s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, where he co-founded a campaign to combat AAPI bullying. Pancholy\u2019s appearance was scheduled by the school\u2019s leadership team, which each year selects an author to present a \u201cunique educational experience for students,\u201d according to the district. The school board's vote to cancel Pancholy's appearance also sparked criticism from several parents, students and community members, who called the decision \u201chomophobic.\u201d Some have started online petitions urging that Pancholy\u2019s appearance be reinstated. In a statement posted on social media this week, Pancholy said his school visits are meant \u201cto let all young people know that they\u2019re seen.\" \"To let them know that they matter.\u201d He also said that one of the reasons he became an author was because as a child he never saw himself represented in stories. \u201cThat\u2019s the power of books. They build empathy,\u201d Pancholy wrote. \u201cI wonder why a school board is so afraid of that?\u201d",

No. On Friday, the pop star released her 11th album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d an amalgamation of her previous work and reflecting the artist who \u2014 at the peak of her powers \u2014 has spent the last few years re-recording her life\u2019s work and touring its material, filtered through synth-pop anthems, breakup ballads, provocative and matured considerations.

            "date": "2024-04-19 00:04:00",
            "content": "ATLANTA -- Lawyers for reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are in prison after being convicted on federal charges of bank fraud and tax evasion, on Friday challenged aspects of their convictions and sentences in a federal appeals court. The Chrisleys rose to fame with their show \u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which chronicled the exploits of their tight-knit family. But prosecutors said they engaged in an extensive bank fraud scheme and hid their earnings from tax authorities while showcasing their extravagant lifestyle. Peter Tarantino, an accountant they hired, also is serving time in prison. He wants his conviction thrown out and to be granted a new trial. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Friday heard arguments from lawyers for the three. Two of the Chrisleys' children, Savannah and Chase, were joined by more than a dozen supporters in the gallery of the courtroom. Savannah Chrisley spoke to reporters after the hearing, saying she talked to her parents Thursday night and that they are \u201cdoing as best as they can\u201d and hope that Friday's hearing is a step toward getting them home. \u201cWe have all come together and we are closer than ever,\u201d she said of her family. The Chrisleys initially were charged in August 2019. In June 2022, a jury found them guilty of conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans. They also were found guilty of tax evasion and conspiring to defraud the IRS, and Julie Chrisley was convicted of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. Todd Chrisley, 56, is at a minimum security federal prison camp in Pensacola, Florida, with a release date in October 2032, while Julie Chrisley, 51, is at a facility in Lexington, Kentucky, and is due for release in July 2028, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Tarantino, 61, was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the United States and willfully filing false tax returns. He is being held in a minimum security federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, with a release date in September of next year. Prosecutors have said the Chrisleys walked away from their responsibility to repay loans when Todd Chrisley declared bankruptcy. While in bankruptcy, they started their reality show and \u201cflaunted their wealth and lifestyle to the American public,\u201d and then hid the millions they made from the show from the IRS, prosecutors have said. Alex Little, a lawyer for the Chrisleys, argued that an IRS officer lied on the stand about the couple still owing taxes at the time of trial when she knew no taxes were due and that prosecutors knowingly presented and failed to correct that false testimony. \u201cThey relied on information they knew to be incorrect,\u201d Little said. Prosecutor Annalise Peters rejected that assertion, saying that when the IRS officer testified, she and prosecutors were unaware of some tax payments the Chrisleys had made. But she said the couple did still owe some taxes at the time. Circuit Judge Robin Rosenbaum, who grilled both sides during the hearing, seemed skeptical of the idea that prosecutors had conspired with an IRS officer to present false information, saying evidence the defense presented in a brief \u201cseemed like pure speculation.\u201d The Chrisleys' lawyers also argue that the trial judge was wrong to allow certain evidence without requiring prosecutors to show it wasn't obtained during an unlawful search. And they argue prosecutors failed to provide enough evidence to convict the Chrisleys of tax evasion and conspiracy, showing only that they used a common entertainment industry practice to receive acting income. They also argue prosecutors failed to produce any evidence that Julie Chrisley participated in bank fraud. They say the judge erred by ordering restitution and forfeiture of assets. Todd Chrisley should be acquitted on the tax evasion and conspiracy counts and given a new trial on the remaining counts, his lawyers argue. Alternatively, the appeals court should send the case back to the trial court to hold a hearing on his claims that the IRS officer lied and evidence was improperly admitted. Julie Chrisley should be acquitted on the five bank fraud charges, her lawyers argue. They also say her sentence on the remaining charges, including $17.2 million in restitution that she and her husband were ordered to pay, should be wiped away and she should be resentenced on those counts. Prosecutors argue there was sufficient evidence at trial to support the charges and jury verdicts, and that the evidence was properly obtained and admitted. Peters argued that there was also no evidence that the IRS officer's testimony affected the jury's verdict. Even if the Chrisleys eventually paid what they owed, \u201clater actions do not nullify the crime,\u201d Peters said. Don Samuel, a lawyer for Tarantino, argued that his client was harmed by being tried with the Chrisleys and he urged the court to reverse Tarantino\u2019s conviction and return his case to the lower court for a new trial. While Tarantino did certain things that ended up facilitating the Chrisleys' fraudulent conduct, there was no evidence he did anything intentionally to facilitate that conduct, Samuel said. The scope of the charges against the Chrisleys \u201cdwarfed the evidence\u201d against Tarantino and prejudiced the jury against him, Samuel said. Peters said there was substantial evidence demonstrating Tarantino's personal involvement and he can't demonstrate actual, compelling evidence that he was harmed by being tried along with the Chrisleys. ___ Associated Press writer Kenya Hunter contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Who knew what Taylor Swift 's latest era would bring? Or even what it would sound like? Would it build off the moodiness of \u201cMidnights\u201d or the folk of \u201cevermore\u201d? The country or the '80s pop of her latest re-records? Or its two predecessors in black-and-white covers: the revenge-pop of \u201cReputation\u201d and the literary Americana of \u201cfolklore\u201d? \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d here Friday, is an amalgamation of all of the above, reflecting the artist who \u2014 at the peak of her powers \u2014 has spent the last few years re-recording her life\u2019s work and touring its material, filtered through synth-pop anthems, breakup ballads, provocative and matured considerations. In moments, her 11th album feels like a bloodletting: A cathartic purge after a major heartbreak delivered through an ascendant vocal run, an elegiac verse, or mobile, synthesized productions that underscore the powers of Swift's storytelling. And there are surprises. The lead single and opener \u201cFortnight\u201d is \u201c1989\u201d grown up \u2014 and features Post Malone. It might seem like a funny pairing, but it's a long time coming: Since at least 2018, Swift's fans have known of her love for Malone's \u201cBetter Now.\u201d \u201cBut Daddy I Love Him\" is the return of country Taylor, in some ways \u2014 fairytale songwriting, a full band chorus, a plucky acoustic guitar riff, and a cheeky lyrical reversal: \u201cBut Daddy I love him / I'm having his baby / No, I'm not / But you should see your faces.\u201d (Babies appear on \u201cFlorida!!!\u201d and the bonus track \u201cThe Manuscript\u201d as well.) The fictitious \u201cFresh Out The Slammer\u201d begins with a really pretty psych guitar tone that disappears beneath wind-blown production; the new wave-adjacent \u201cMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\u201d brings back \u201cBarbie\u201d: \u201cI felt more when we played pretend than with all the Kens / 'Cause he took me out of my box.\u201d Even before Florence Welch kicks off her verse in \u201cFlorida!!!,\u201d the chorus' explosive repetition of the song title hits hard with nostalgic 2010s indie rock, perhaps an alt-universe Swiftian take on Sufjan Stevens' \u201cIllinois.\u201d As another title states, \"So Long, London,\" indeed. It would be a disservice to read Swift's songs as purely diaristic, but that track \u2014 the fifth on this album, which her fans typically peg as the most devastating slot on each album \u2014 evokes striking parallels to her relationship with a certain English actor she split with in 2023. Place it next to a sleepy love ode like \u201cThe Alchemy,\u201d with its references to \u201ctouchdown\u201d and cutting someone \u201cfrom the team\u201d and well ... art imitates life. Revenge is still a pervasive theme. But where the reprisal anthems on \u201cMidnights\u201d were vindictive, on \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d there are new complexities: \u201cWho's Afraid of Little Old Me?\u201d combines the musical ambitiousness of \"evermore\u201d and \"folklore\" \u2014 and adds a resounding bass on the bridge \u2014 with sensibilities ripped from the weapons-drawn, obstinate \u201cReputation.\" But here, Swift mostly trades victimhood for self-assurance, warts and all. \u201cWho's afraid of little old me?\u201d she sings. \"You should be,\u201d she responds. And yet, \u201cThe Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\u201d may be her most biting song to date: \u201cYou didn\u2019t measure up in any measure of a man,\u201d she sings atop propulsive piano. \u201cI\u2019ll forget you, but I won\u2019t ever forgive,\u201d she describes her target, likely the same \u201ctattooed golden retriever,\u201d a jejune description, mentioned in the title track. Missteps are few, found in other mawkish lyrics and songs like \u201cDown Bad\u201d and \u201cGuilty as Sin?\u201d that falter when placed next to the album's more meditative pop moments. Elsewhere, Swift holds up a mirror to her melodrama and melancholy \u2014 she's crying at the gym, don't tell her about \u201csad,\u201d is she allowed to cry? She died inside, she thinks you might want her dead; she thinks she might just die. She listens to the voices that tell her \u201cLights, camera, bitch, smile / Even when you want to die,\" as she sings on \u201cI Can Do It with a Broken Heart,\u201d a song about her own performances \u2014 onstage and as a public figure. \u201cI'm miserable and nobody even knows!\" she laughs at the end of the song before sighing, \u201cTry and come for my job.\u201d \u201cClara Bow\u201d enters the pantheon of great final tracks on a Swift album. The title refers to the 1920s silent film star who burned fast and bright \u2014 an early \u201cIt girl\u201d and Hollywood sex symbol subject to vitriolic gossip, a victim of easy, everyday misogyny amplified by celebrity. Once Bow's harsh Brooklyn accent was heard in the talkies, it was rumored, her career was over. In life, Bow later attempted suicide and was sent to an asylum \u2014 the same institution that appears on \u201cWho's Afraid of Little Old Me?\u201d \u201cClara Bow\u201d works as an allegory and a cautionary tale for Swift, the same way Stevie Nicks' \u201cMabel Normand\" \u2014 another tragic silent film star \u2014 functioned for the Fleetwood Mac star. Nicks appears in \u201cClara Bow,\u201d too: \u201cYou look like Stevie Nicks in \u201975 / The hair and lips / Crowd goes wild.\" Later, Swift turns the camera inward, and the song ends with her singing, \u201cYou look like Taylor Swift in this light / We\u2019re loving it / You\u2019ve got edge / She never did.\u201d The album ends there, on what could be read as self-deprecation but stings more like frustrating self-awareness. Swift sings about a tortured poet, but she is one, too. And isn't it great that she's allowed herself the creative license?",

            "date": "2024-04-18 18:11:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- The judge in Donald Trump 's hush money trial ordered the media on Thursday not to report on where potential jurors have worked and to be careful about revealing information about those who will sit in judgment of the former president. Judge Juan Merchan acted after one juror was dismissed when she expressed concerns about participating in the trial after details about her became publicly known. The names of the jurors are supposed to be a secret, but the dismissed juror told Merchan she had friends, colleagues and family members contacting her to ask whether she was on the case. \u201cI don\u2019t believe at this point I can be fair and unbiased and let the outside influences not affect my decision-making in the courtroom,\u201d she said. Merchan then directed journalists present in the courthouse not to report it when potential jurors told the court their specific workplaces, past or present. That put journalists in the difficult position of not reporting something they heard in open court. Some media organizations were considering whether to protest having that onus placed on them. Generally, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars judges from ordering journalists not to disclose what they hear and see in courtrooms open to the public, though there are exceptions, such as when military security is at stake. New York criminal defense lawyer Ron Kuby said that while judges typically can\u2019t control what the media reports, other options are available to protect juror anonymity, including restricting what reporters see and hear in the courtroom. \u201cThere are actions the judge could take,\" he said. \u201cCourts have extraordinary powers to protect jurors from tampering and intimidation. It is really where a court\u2019s power is at its peak.\u201d The court action underscored the difficulty of trying to maintain anonymity for jurors in a case that has sparked wide interest and heated opinions, while lawyers need to sift through as much information as possible in a public courtroom to determine who to choose. Despite the setback, 12 jurors were seated by the end of Thursday for the historic trial. Trump is charged with falsifying his company's business records to cover up an effort during the 2016 presidential election campaign to squash negative publicity about alleged marital infidelity. Part of the case involves a $130,000 payment made to porn actor Stormy Daniels to prevent her from making public her claims of a sexual meeting with Trump years earlier. Trump has denied the encounter. New York state law requires trial attorneys to get the names of jurors, but the judge has ordered the lawyers in Trump's case not to disclose those names publicly. The jurors' names haven't been mentioned in court during three days of jury selection. Still, enough personal information about the jurors was revealed in court that people might be able to identify them anyway. Some news organizations described details including what Manhattan neighborhoods potential jurors lived in, what they did for a living, what academic degrees they had earned, how many children they had, what countries they grew up in and what their spouses did for a living. On Fox News Channel Wednesday night, host Jesse Watters did a segment with a jury consultant, revealing details about people who had been seated on the jury and questioning whether some were \u201cstealth liberals\u201d who would be out to convict Trump. Besides his order about employment history, Merchan said he was asking the media to \u201csimply apply common sense and refrain from writing about anything that has to do, for example, with physical descriptions.\u201d He said \u201cthere was really no need\u201d for the media to mention one widely-reported tidbit that a juror speaks with an Irish accent. Anonymous juries have long existed, particularly in terrorism and mob-related cases or when there is a history of jury tampering. They have been ordered more frequently in the last two decades with the rising influence of social media and the anonymous hate speech that is sometimes associated with it. Usually courtroom artists are told they aren't permitted to draw the face of any juror in their sketches; New York courts do not permit video coverage of trials. During the Trump defamation trial in Manhattan federal court earlier this year, jurors had heightened protection of their identities by a security-conscious judge who routinely did not allow anyone in his courtroom to have a cellphone, even if it was shut off. Jurors were driven to and from the courthouse by the U.S. Marshals Service and were sequestered from the public during trial breaks. When asked general questions about themselves during jury selection in that case, prospective jurors often gave vague answers that would have made it nearly impossible to determine much about them. After the ruling in that case, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ordered the anonymous jury not to disclose the identities of any of the people they served with, and advised jurors not to disclose their service. So far, none have come forward publicly. Kuby said the ability of lawyers at Trump's trial to research the backgrounds of jurors was important. \u201cBoth sides have interest in preventing sleeper jurors who have their own agenda from serving on the jury,\u201d he said. Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who is president of the West Coast Trial Lawyers, said the difficulty at the Trump trial is weeding out people with extreme viewpoints. \u201cEveryone in the entire country knows who Donald Trump is,\" Rahmani said. \"Some think he\u2019s a criminal traitor and insurrectionist. Others think he\u2019s a hero. You don\u2019t have a lot of people in the middle.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Michael R. Sisak and Jake Offenhartz contributed to this report.",

            "content": "MECHANICSBURG, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania school district has canceled an upcoming appearance by actor and children's book author Maulik Pancholy after district leaders cited concerns about what they described as his activism and \u201clifestyle.\u201d Pancholy, who is gay, was scheduled to speak against bullying during a May 22 assembly at Mountain View Middle School in Cumberland County. However, the district's school board voted unanimously Monday night to cancel his talk after some members voiced concerns and others noted the district's policy about not hosting overtly political events, news outlets reported. The policy was enacted after the district was criticized for hosting a rally by Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign for president. Pancholy, 48, is an award-winning actor, including for his roles on the television shows \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cWeeds,\u201d and as the voice of Baljeet in the Disney animated series, \u201cPhineas & Ferb.\u201d He also has written children's books and in 2014 was named by then-President Barack Obama to serve on the President\u2019s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, where he co-founded a campaign to combat AAPI bullying. Pancholy's appearance was scheduled by the school's leadership team, which each year selects an author to present a \"unique educational experience for students,\u201d according to the district. While discussing the appearance at Monday night's meeting, school board members said they did not know what Pancholy's talk would be about, but one member said he didn't \u201cwant to run the risk\u201d of what it might entail. \u201cIf you research this individual, he labels himself as an activist,\u201d Bud Shaffner said, according to Pennlive. \u201cHe is proud of his lifestyle, and I don\u2019t think that should be imposed upon our students, at any age.\u201d The board's vote sparked criticism from several parents, students and community members who called the decision \u201chomophobic.\u201d Some have started online petitions urging that Pancholy's appearance be reinstated. In a statement posted on social media, Pancholy said that as a middle school student he never saw himself represented in stories, and that books featuring South Asian-American or LGBTQ+ characters \u201cdidn\u2019t exist.\u201d When he started writing his own novels years later, he was still hard-pressed to find those stories, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s why I wrote my books in the first place,\u201d Pancholy wrote. \u201cBecause representation matters.\u201d Pancholy said his school visits are meant \"to let all young people know that they\u2019re seen. To let them know that they matter.\" When he talks about his characters feeling \"different,\" he said he is always surprised by how many children of various identities and backgrounds want to share how they feel different too. \u201cThat\u2019s the power of books. They build empathy,\u201d Pancholy wrote. \u201cI wonder why a school board is so afraid of that?\u201d",

            "content": "SANTA FE, N.M. -- An attorney has been added to the special prosecution team that is pursuing an involuntary manslaughter charge against actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western movie \u201cRust,\u201d court officials confirmed Thursday. The district attorney for Santa Fe has appointed Erlinda Johnson as special prosecutor to the case, which is scheduled for trial in July. She was sworn in Tuesday. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to an involuntary manslaughter charge in the shooting of Halyna Hutchins during an October 2021 rehearsal at a movie-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe. Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer for \u201cRust,\u201d was pointing a gun at Hutchins during rehearsal when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Johnson's experience as a criminal defense and personal injury attorney include representing former New Mexico Secretary of State Dianna Duran, who resigned in 2015 amid revelations she used campaign funds to fuel a gambling addiction. Duran received a 30-day jail sentence after pleading guilty to embezzlement and money laundering charges. Johnson previously worked as a federal prosecutor on drug enforcement and organized crime investigations after serving as assistant district attorney in the Albuquerque area. Prosecutors are turning their full attention to Baldwin after a judge on Monday sentenced movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed to the maximum of 18 months at a state penitentiary on an involuntary manslaughter conviction Hutchins's death. Prosecutors said Gutierrez-Reed unwittingly brought live ammunition onto the set of \u201cRust,\u201d where it was expressly prohibited, and failed to follow basic gun safety protocols. She was convicted by a jury in March. Defense attorneys for Baldwin are urging the judge to dismiss the indictment against him, accusing prosecutors of \u201cunfairly stacking the deck\u201d in grand jury proceedings and diverting attention away from exculpatory evidence and witnesses. Special prosecutors deny those accusations and accuse Baldwin of \u201cshameless\u201d attempts to escape culpability, highlighting contradictions in his statements to law enforcement, to workplace safety regulators and in a televised interview.",

Take \u201cCivil War,\u201d Alex Garland\u2019s seemingly very of-the-moment, election -year release that led the box office over last weekend. Garland wrote it in 2020 as the pandemic was unfolding and a presidential election was approaching. \u201cCivil War\u201d arrived in theaters four years later, loaded with the anxieties of societal breakdown and concern for the endgame to our current political extremism. But it also very consciously stepped away from the bitter partisanship of today. \u201cCivil War\u201d sparked a lot of discussion by pairing California and Texas together in battle, but that\u2019s far from the only gesture Garland made to avoid channeling the current, highly charged fissures of American society. The movie, perhaps out of fear of being too contemporary, is set in a near-future dystopia. Scant mention is made of race, income inequality or climate change. It has connective tissue with many current issues, particularly the plight of journalists. But it\u2019s telling that even a provocative movie that imagines America in all-out warfare is timid about today. Yet even if \u201cCivil War\u201d was bracingly current, would that have been appropriate in an election year? More importantly, would we even want to see it? With many exceptions, the movie year in multiplexes can seem forever toggling between the period dramas of Oscar season and the sequels of summer, a seemingly willful dance to forever avoid the here and now. To a large degree, Hollywood runs on intellectual property, which, by its definition, is old. That didn\u2019t stop \u201cBarbie\u201d from being highly relevant 64 years after the doll\u2019s creation, or a 70-year-old Godzilla from showing some new moves, or 62-year-old Spider-Man proving surprisingly adept at reflecting our chaotic digital lives. But finding movies free of decades-old baggage or loads of CGI that masks the real world can take some effort. That dearth has made a pair of spring releases \u2014 Radu Jude\u2019s \u201cDo Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World\u201d and Bertrand Bonello\u2019s \u201cThe Beast\u201d \u2014 all the more thrilling for their eagerness to confront our present reality. \u201cDo Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World,\u201d the latest from the 47-year-old Romanian writer and director Jude, begins with an iPhone alarm clock going off. On the disheveled nightstand of Angela R\u0103ducanu (Ilinca Manolache) is a wine glass, paperback Proust and a clock with no hands, beneath which it reads \u201cIt\u2019s later than you think.\u201d Angela\u2019s life is a discombobulated swirl of GPS-navigated traffic, boorish men and work errands. Everything from the war in Ukraine to gun violence to Pornhub is filtered into her daily experience while she drives to appointments to make workplace-safety videos for a production company. Angela occasionally boils over, though she mostly vents through TikTok, spouting misogynist incel rants with a filter that cloaks her identity. The persona is modeled after the online influencer Andrew Tate, who is charged in Bucharest with human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. He\u2019s denied the allegations. Interspersed with Angela\u2019s story are excerpts from Lucian Bratu\u2019s 1981 film \u201cAngela Goes On.\u201d That Angela (played by Dorina Laz\u0103r) spends her days driving, too, as a taxi driver, and the juxtaposition between the two Angelas invites a comparison between that era and now. Today, filming in a harsh monochrome, doesn\u2019t come off looking so good \u2014 even next to the communist Romania of the 1981 film. Bonello\u2019s \u201cThe Beast,\u201d which expands this Friday in theaters, also uses separate timelines to illuminate present reality while pondering if we aren\u2019t just doomed to repeat the past. The movie, inspired by the Henry James novella \u201cThe Beast in the Jungle,\u201d follows two lovers \u2014 Gabrielle (L\u00e9a Seydoux) and Louis (George MacKay) \u2014through three time periods: 1910 Paris, 2014 Los Angeles and 2044 Paris. In the first chapter, Gabrielle and Louis are brought together \u2014 not for the first time, Louis reminds her \u2014 in belle \u00e9poque Paris just before the Great Flood of 1910. Their connection is palpable but the encounter ends in tragedy, in an underwater sequence of haunting power in the doll factory of Gabrielle's husband. The switch, then, from costume drama to more-or-less contemporary Los Angeles is jarring. But our characters are still some distant versions of their prior selves. Gabrielle, previously a pianist, is now an actor. Louis is a misogynistic vlogger whose incel delusions \u2014 along with some strange force drawing them back together \u2014 bring him again into Gabrielle\u2019s orbit. The echoes of their past lives are even more acute in 2044, by which time artificial intelligence has spread into all corners of life and Gabrielle is considering undergoing a procedure to \u201cpurify\u201d her DNA. She\u2019s told she won\u2019t lose her emotions but will feel more \u201cserenely.\u201d The bookends of past and present in \u201cThe Beast\u201d put dehumanization \u2014 from doll-making to A.I. \u2014 in disquieting context. It\u2019s not a coincidence that both \u201cThe Beast\u201d and \u201cDo Not Expect Too Much From the End of the Earth\u201d wrestle with incel culture. To do so may be a necessary ingredient for making sense of our present reality. Sean Price Williams\u2019 \u201cThe Sweet East,\u201d a scuzzy, vital picaresque from last year, glibly but perceptively surveyed a ridiculous America of worlds-apart subcultures, conspiracy-addled shooters and bookish white supremacists. With a cast including Simon Rex, Jeremy O. Harris, Ayo Edebiri and Jacob Elordi, but a central heroine in Lillian (Talia Ryder), \u201cThe Sweet East\u201d played like an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d for now \u2013 an absurd odyssey for absurd times. None of these films \u2014 \u201cThe Beast,\u201d \u201cDo Not Expect Too Much From the End of the Earth,\u201d \u201cThe Sweet East\u201d \u2014 are perfect, or even trying to be. But, unlike \u201cCivil War,\u201d they aren\u2019t dodging anything. The present may be messy and muddled but these films, in very distinct and outlandish ways, are at least trying to pin it down. ___ Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",

GloRilla, whose real name is Gloria Woods, was charged Tuesday with first-offense driving under the influence of alcohol; having an open container of alcohol; and failing to obey a traffic control device, according to Gwinnett County Jail booking records. Woods, 24, of Memphis, Tennessee, was arrested by police in Suwanee, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta. Officers pulled over a black Mercedes-Benz after it was seen making a U-turn at a red light, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. \u201cI asked Woods how much she had consumed and what beverages she had consumed; however, Woods continued to relay that it does not matter and she was good to drive,\u201d the officer wrote in the police report obtained by the newspaper. Woods' eyes appeared to be bloodshot, she had a hard time finishing her thoughts and refused to take a breathalyzer test, the officer wrote. She was booked into the jail at 6:12 a.m. Tuesday and released at 9:41 a.m. the same day. The jail records do not indicate whether Woods has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.",

            "content": "LONDON -- Prince Harry, the son of King Charles III and fifth in line to the British throne, has formally confirmed he is now a U.S. resident. Four years after Harry and his American wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, decamped to a villa in Southern California, a travel company he controls filed paperwork this week informing British authorities that he has moved and is now \u201cusually resident\u201d in the United States. The formal acknowledgment underscores the prince\u2019s increasing estrangement from Britain, after he and Meghan walked away from royal duties to pursue lucrative media deals in America. Since then, Harry has repeatedly criticized the royal family, including allegations of unconscious racism that were included in a Netflix series and the prince\u2019s autobiography, \u201cSpare.\u201d The paperwork was filed by Travalyst Ltd, a company at least 75% owned by Harry and which was founded in 2020 to \u201cto promote global awareness of the importance of sustainable tourism.\u201d The documentation was received Monday by Companies House, the government agency that oversees the incorporation of U.K. companies. The filing further separates Harry from his role as one of the king\u2019s counselors of state \u2014 members of the royal family who can be deputized to carry out the duties of the monarch if he is unwell or out of the country. While Harry formally remains a counselor of state, the crown informed Parliament in 2022 that \u201cin practice\u201d only working members of the royal family would be called upon to fill in for the monarch. Although Harry and Meghan, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have put down roots in the wealthy enclave of Montecito, where they are raising their young son and daughter, Harry is also facing scrutiny about his U.S. residency. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has questioned the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s decision to grant Harry a U.S. visa following admissions of drug use that were included in \u201cSpare.\u201d The foundation, which has asked a judge to force the department to release Harry\u2019s immigration file, argues that the prince either lied on his visa application or was given special treatment because a history of drug use would normally disqualify an applicant from being granted a visa.",

His extraordinary guitar playing alongside guitarist Duane Allman created a unique dual guitar signature sound that became the signature sound of the genre known as Southern Rock. He was passionate in life, be it music, songwriting, fishing, hunting, boating, golf, karate or boxing. Dickey was all in on and excelled at anything that caught his attention. Betts joins his brothers, Duane Allman, Berry Oakley, Butch Trucks and Gregg Allman, as well as ABB crew members Twiggs Lyndon, Joe Dan Petty, Red Dog, Kim Payne and Mike Callahan in that old Winnebago in the sky touring the world taking their music to all who will listen.\u201d \u2014 Allman Brothers Band on X. \u201cMy first concert was Dickey Betts at Coleman's in Rome, New York in 1983. Blew my mind and made me want a Les Paul.\u201d \u2014 guitarist Joe Bonamassa on X. \u201cThe memories hit me hard this morning after learning of his passing. The monuments that he helped to create for southern rock will never be replicated. From the beginning, before achieving incredible success, he was a man that stood strong by himself. The things that matter the most to musicians were things Dickey already thought of. His God-given strength would not allow for failure in music or in life. May the world never forget this gentleman.\u201d \u2014 Doug Gray, lead singer of The Marshall Tucker Band on X. \u201cRIP Dickey Betts. My pops used to see him live in the early 70\u2019s. Then I got to enjoy him live in the 90\u2019s at Lakewood Amphitheater on so many occasions. Wonderful songwriter and phenomenal improviser. Thank you for the memories.\u201d \u2014 guitarist Jason \u201cJJ Boogie\u201d Reichert of Arrested Development on X. \u201cUncle Dickey believed in me, pushed me, took me on the road many times, took care of me, he and his family always looked out for me. Betts and Oakley\u2019s have always been close. My father would not join Duane\u2019s band without Dickey!! And in 1989 uncle Dickey stepped up and (showed) me the way, my family history, his deep connection to my father, all about ABB and what my father meant to the band. I owe so much to Dickey and his family. If not for him, I don\u2019t think I would be a touring musician.

            "title": "Not only New York casinos threaten Atlantic City. Developer predicts Meadowlands casino is coming",
            "date": "2024-04-18 13:27:00",
            "content": "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Atlantic City casinos are facing threats on multiple fronts from new competitors not just in New York, but from within their own state. That's not great news for a seaside resort in which the amount of money won from in-person gamblers continues to lag, with seven of the nine casinos winning less from on-premises customers than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. At the East Coast Gaming Congress Thursday at the Hard Rock casino, numerous executives from some of the major casino companies in America acknowledged the opportunity of three downstate New York casino licenses \u2014 and the risk they will present to Atlantic City. And the operator of a racetrack in northern New Jersey, just outside New York City, told The Associated Press he believes New Jersey voters will authorize construction of a casino in the Meadowlands shortly after New York casinos open and New Jersey gamblers tire of paying bridge tolls and sitting in traffic to get to gambling halls in New York. \u201cNow more than ever we know there's a threat coming with New York City gaming coming,\u201d Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small said at the conference. \u201cWe understand the threat. We want to continue to work together to do things right to put Atlantic City into a prime position, no matter where these casinos are, that we diversify our options.\u201d Jim Allen, chairman of Hard Rock International, is straddling both markets. His company operates a casino in Atlantic City that is the second-most successful in the market. And Hard Rock is partnering with New York Mets owner Steve Cohen on a proposed $8 billion casino complex at Citi Field in the city's Queens section. If as many as three casino open in or close to New York City, Allen said, Atlantic City's in-person gambling revenues could fall by 20% to 30%. \u201cWe have to be prepared for that,\u201d he told attendees at the conference. Allen said Atlantic City's Hard Rock will weather the storm of New York competition. But he said he does not want to see any competitors in the city close, throwing 2,000 to 3,000 people out of work in a repetition of a wave of casino closings in Atlantic City from 2014 to 2016 that saw five casinos close. Two have since reopened under new ownership. Tom Reeg. CEO of Caesars Entertainment, which owns three of Atlantic City's nine casinos, also said New York casinos will be a challenge. His company, too, is seeking a New York casino license with SL Green, and Roc Nation in Times Square. \u201cWe're pursuing that license with fervor,\u201d Reeg said. \u201cI share Jim's concern about where the (Atlantic City) market is headed as we head into New York.\u201d Soo Kim, chairman of Bally's Corporation, which has a casino in Atlantic City, said table games revenue from New York gamblers \u201cwill be harder to attract\u201d once casinos open in New York City. \u201cWith casinos in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware, there's casinos everywhere.\u201d He said New Jersey can rely on its robust internet gambling market to offset some expected losses. Concerns don't end with New York. Jeff Gural runs the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just outside New York City, along with the Tioga Downs and Vernon Downs racetrack casinos in upstate New York. He also has a deal with Hard Rock to build a casino at the Meadowlands Racetrack \u2014 a proposal that was put on the back burner when New Jersey voters overwhelmingly rejected a referendum on expanding casino gambling beyond Atlantic City in 2016. \u201cI'm just waiting for New York to open,\u201d Gural said in an interview. \u201cPeople will say, \u2018Why am I driving over the George Washington Bridge and paying an $18 toll and sitting in traffic to go gamble?\u2019\u201d Gural said the 2016 referendum failed largely because it was written to permit more than one casino in northern New Jersey without specifying where. \u201cPeople don't want a casino in the neighborhood,\u201d Gural said. \u201cIf we make it clear it's only at the Meadowlands, common sense tells you there will be a casino in the Meadowlands.\u201d Gural said that will happen in \u201ca lot sooner than 10 years.\u201d Mark Giannantonio, president of Atlantic City's Resorts casino and of the Casino Association of New Jersey, said during Wednesday's opening day session of the convention that Atlantic City views New York casinos as a threat. \u201cNew Jersey has to be prepared for this, to make Atlantic City more attractive for people to visit, and there's a lot of work to do,\u201d he said. \u201cTable games clearly will be impacted.\u201d He said Atlantic City has a \"two-year window\" to prepare for New York competition by cleaning itself up, improving its infrastructure, and assigning more police to the Boardwalk and other areas so visitors see a visible law enforcement presence. He also said Atlantic City needs to solve its problem with homelessness. But Giannantonio said Atlantic City can survive the advent of new competition in an already cutthroat northeastern casino market. \u201cI'm always going to rely on hotel, entertainment, retail and the experience on the casino floor,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in my heart that Atlantic City, with some hard work, will be an opportunity. We're excited about the future.\u201d ___ Follow Wayne Parry on X, formerly Twitter, at https://twitter.com/WayneParryAC.",

            "date": "2024-04-18 12:58:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- At an age when many contemporaries contemplate retirement, musician T Bone Burnett has made big changes in his life and art. Burnett, most celebrated for his production acumen, uprooted from Los Angeles to move to Nashville and recorded a warm-hearted disc of his own songs for the first time in nearly two decades. Indie rockers Lucius and Rosanne Cash add their voices to the acoustic collection. \u201cI'm so grateful that this music has come to me out of nowhere and without even trying for it to happen,\u201d Burnett, 76, says in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cYou know, it feels like the most pure experience of making music I've ever had.\u201d His disc, \u201cThe Other Side,\u201d comes out Friday, the same day as Taylor Swift 's new \u201cTortured Poets Department.\u201d They will not be competing at the top of the charts. \u201cShe's a miraculous person, Taylor Swift,\u201d Burnett says. \u201cShe's an amazing force for good in the world. She's like Springsteen. She makes a connection with the audience. That is a gift from God. And that's not my gift.\u201d While Burnett first became known musically as a guitarist in Bob Dylan's rollicking Rolling Thunder Revue in the 1970s and has periodically recorded his own songs, he's more often been a spectral, benevolent presence in a studio working with some of music's most celebrated artists. Burnett\u2019s production of the \u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201d soundtrack and the \u201cRaising Sands\u201d collaboration between Alison Krauss and Robert Plant are celebrated and responsible for many of 13 Grammy Awards. His list of credits also include a solo Dylan years later, Counting Crows, Brandi Carlile, Elvis Costello, Sara Bareilles, Roy Orbison, Los Lobos and his ex-wife, Sam Phillips. Elton John once said Burnett restored his love of recording. Soundtrack music for \u201cCold Mountain,\u201d \u201cCrazy Hearts\u201d and \u201cNashville\u201d bear his imprint. \u201cHe\u2019s a masterful ringleader,\u201d Krauss said in an interview. While some producers want to manipulate sounds, she says, Burnett is intent upon \u201cgetting the most honest, uncloudy performance of each musician and vocalist.\" While he liked the Beatles and other performers while growing up in Fort Worth, Texas, Burnett was also intrigued by behind-the-scenes maestros like Phil Spector and Burt Bacharach. Working in private, mixing sounds into something special \u2014 not to mention being married to actress Angie Dickinson, in Bacharach's case \u2014 \u201cthat's the life to have,\u201d Burnett says. Knowing that a studio is where an artist is most naked, trying to coax creativity onto a blank tape, Burnett says his philosophy is that 90 percent of the job is offering support. \u201cSupport and encouragement, patience and courage, is a lot of it,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of it is just being willing to wait. And have faith that it's going to get there when things aren't going great.\u201d Sometimes the best advice can be something simple \u2014 like \u201csing louder.\u201d Although most associated with rootsy music, Burnett feels that his signature is not necessarily a style of music but a purity of sound and tone. Given his mild-mannered nature and the loveliness of much of what he's worked on, it's odd to hear Burnett talk about how for many years his own music was inspired by dystopian visions that grew from a teenaged nightmare about thought control experiments. A recent collaborative project, \u201cThe Invisible Light,\u201d is abrasive and hard to listen to. As the title of his new album suggests, though, he has come out the other side. \u201cIn a way, I killed T Bone Burnett,\u201d he says. \u201cI just did. I'd had enough of that. I'd had enough of the dystopia, and I don't want to spread that any further. I didn't want to even participate in it.\u201d Now in Nashville, a move precipitated by both the pandemic and business reasons for his wife, screenwriter Callie Khouri, he has considered a life where his main outlet is writing songs for other people to record. That was his thought when he began composing the new music \u2014 and he'd still like others to try those songs \u2014 but while recording he noted a cohesion that made for a good album. He'd been doing some writing for a musical about Roy Rogers, and studying the work of Broadway songwriter Frank Loesser. That influenced his own writing on \u201cThe Other Side,\u201d a love story that is tight and concise with simple rhyming structures. Invited to hear Burnett's new music, Krauss was blown away. She says she was struck by how the songs sounded both fresh and familiar at the same time. \u201cI love it,\u201d she says. \"I love the treatment of the songs. The songs themselves are so beautiful. I remember my heart pacing at wanting to sing the songs myself. \u201cIt just made me appreciate him on a whole other level upon hearing it,\u201d Krauss says. \u201cIt was just so stunning. The music reminded me of when I heard other music that changed my standards.\u201d Burnett hasn't shut the door on production work. He is working on something new with Ringo Starr, but exploring his own writing with a freer perspective is appealing to him now. The best part of a creative life, he says, is that \u201cyou get to do it as long as you want to, as long as you can.\" \u201cI trust life,\u201d he says. \u201cI trust happiness. In fact, it's the only thing I do trust now so it's a major shift in my whole life. I'm 76 now, so I want to use what time I have let, I want to spend it happily. Creating and creating love. Creating good vibes, if I may still use that word.\u201d ___ Follow David Bauder at http://twitter.com/dbauder",

            "date": "2024-04-18 12:26:00",
            "content": "Dickey Betts, who died Thursday at age 80, really was born a ramblin\u2019 man. He left home at 16 to join the circus and became a renowned guitarist touring the world with the Allman Brothers Band. He wrote the group\u2019s biggest hit, \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man,\u201d and remained on the road until he reached the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Betts died at his home in Osprey, Florida, his manager of 20 years, David Spero, said by phone. He had been battling cancer for more than a year and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Spero said. \u201cHe was surrounded by his whole family and he passed peacefully. They didn\u2019t think he was in any pain,\u201d he said. Betts shared lead guitar duties with Duane Allman in the original Allman Brothers Band to help give the group its unique sound and create a new genre, Southern rock. The band blended blues, country, R & B and jazz with \u201960s rock to produce a distinct sound that influenced a host of major acts, including Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, Phish, Jason Isbell and Chris Stapleton, among many others. \u201cMy first concert was Dickey Betts at Coleman\u2019s in Rome, New York in 1983,\u201d blues-rock guitarist Joe Bonamassa said in an Instagram post Thursday, crediting Betts with inspiring his favorite electric guitar model. \u201cBlew my mind and made me want a Les Paul.\u201d Other tributes came from members of the Allman Brothers Band\u2019s extended family. Guitarist Derek Trucks and his wife and bandmate, Susan Tedeschi, posted on their Instagram account that Betts was \u201cone of best to ever do it.\u201d Trucks joined the Allman Brothers Band in 1999. His uncle Butch Trucks was one of the band\u2019s two founding drummers. Bassist Berry Duane Oakley, son of Allman Brothers founding bassist Berry Oakley, honored his \u201cUncle Dickey\u201d on Facebook, saying: \u201cIf not for him, I don\u2019t think I would be a touring musician. The cat in the hat will never be forgotten, and will always be honored not only for the wonderful life he lived, but the wonderful music he has left behind for all of us to share and remember.\u201d Founded in 1969, the Allmans were a pioneering jam band, trampling the traditional formula of three-minute pop songs by performing lengthy compositions in concert and on record. The band was also notable as a biracial group from the Deep South. Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident in 1971, and Berry Oakley was killed in a motorcycle crash the following year. That left Betts and Allman\u2019s younger brother, Gregg, as the band\u2019s leaders, but they frequently clashed, and substance abuse caused further dysfunction. The band broke up at least twice before reforming, and has had more than a dozen lineups. The Allman Brothers Band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and earned a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2012. Betts left the group for good in 2000. He also played solo and with his own band Great Southern, which included his son, guitarist Duane Betts. Forrest Richard Betts was born Dec. 12, 1943, and raised in the Bradenton, Florida, area, near the highway 41 he sang about in \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man.\u201d His family had lived in area since the mid-19th century. A descendant of Canadian fiddlers, Betts was listening to string bands before he even started school. He developed a fondness for country, bluegrass and Western swing, and played the ukulele and banjo before focusing on the electric guitar because it impressed girls. But he usually did his songwriting on an acoustic guitar. Betts changed schools often because his father worked construction, and those memories later inspired him to write \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man.\u201d His first big road trip came when he joined the circus to play in a band. He returned home, and with Oakley joined a group that became the Jacksonville, Florida-based band Second Coming. One night in 1969, Betts and Oakley jammed with Duane Allman, already a successful session musician, and his younger brother. Together they formed the Allman Brothers Band. Betts \u201cexcelled at anything that caught his attention,\u201d according to a statement posted Thursday on the Allman Brothers Band's official website. \u201cHe was passionate in life, be it music, songwriting, fishing, hunting, boating, golf, karate or boxing.\u201d The group moved to Macon, Georgia, and released a self-titled debut album in 1969. A year later came the album \u201cIdlewild South,\u201d highlighted by Betts\u2019 instrumental composition \u201cIn Memory of Elizabeth Reed,\u201d which soon became a concert favorite. The 1971 double album \u201cAt Fillmore East,\u201d now considered among the greatest live albums of the classic rock era, was the Allmans\u2019 commercial breakthrough and cemented their performing reputation by showcasing the unique guitar interplay between Allman and Betts. Their styles contrasted, with Allman playing bluesy slide guitar, while Betts\u2019 solos and singing tugged the band toward country. When layered in harmony, their playing was especially distinctive. The group also had two drummers \u2014 Butch Trucks and John Lee \u201cJaimoe\u201d Johanson, a Black musician from Mississippi who helped integrate Southern rock. Duane Allman died four days after \u201cFillmore\u201d was certified as a gold record, but the band carried on and crowds continued to grow. The 1973 album \u201cBrothers and Sisters\u201d rose to No. 1 on the charts and featured \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man,\u201d with Betts singing the lead and bringing twang to the Top 40. The song\u2019s intro suggested a fiddle tune, while the coda was inspired by Derek and the Dominos\u2019 \u201cLayla,\u201d an earlier hit that had featured Duane Allman. \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man\u201d reached No. 2 on the singles charts and was kept out of the No. 1 spot by \u201cHalf Breed\u201d by Cher, who later married Gregg Allman. Betts\u2019 composition became a classic-rock standard, with his soaring guitar reverberating in neighborhood bars around the country for decades. \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man\u201d was the Allmans\u2019 only Top Ten hit, but Betts\u2019 catchy 7 \u00bd-minute instrumental composition \u201cJessica,\u201d recorded in 1972, also showed his knack for melodic hooks and became an FM radio staple. Painstaking in his approach to songwriting, Betts spent two months composing \u201cJessica,\u201d which was inspired by the music of jazz guitar great Django Reinhardt. Betts also wrote or co-wrote some of the Allmans\u2019 other best-loved songs, including \u201cBlue Sky\u201d and \u201cSouthbound.\u201d Dormant for most of the 1980s, the Allman Brothers Band launched a comeback in 1990 with Warren Haynes joining Betts on guitar. Betts recorded three more studio albums and toured with the band over the next decade, but he had an acrimonious split from the Allman Brothers in 2000. His bandmates suspended the guitarist from their summer tour and issued a statement blaming \u201ccreative differences.\u201d Betts said Gregg Allman and the other members delivered the news in a fax implying he needed treatment for substance abuse. Betts took legal action and settled with the band in arbitration. The breakup was permanent. Gregg Allman and Butch Trucks died in 2017. After leaving the Allmans for good, Betts continued to play with his own group and lived in the Bradenton area with his wife, Donna. ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Dickey Betts' name.

            "date": "2024-04-18 11:31:00",
            "content": "DALLAS -- The first model of the USS Enterprise \u2014 used in the opening credits of the original \u201cStar Trek\u201d television series \u2014 has boldly gone back home, returning to creator Gene Roddenberry's son decades after it went missing. The model's disappearance sometime in the 1970s had become the subject of lore, so it caused a stir when it popped up on eBay last fall. The sellers quickly took it down, and then contacted Dallas-based Heritage Auctions to authenticate it. Last weekend, the auction house facilitated the model's return. Eugene \u201cRod\u201d Roddenberry, CEO of Roddenberry Entertainment, said he's thrilled to have the model that had graced the desk of his father, who died in 1991 at age 70. \u201cThis is not going home to adorn my shelves,\" Roddenberry said. \u201cThis is going to get restored and we\u2019re working on ways to get it out so the public can see it and my hope is that it will land in a museum somewhere.\u201d Heritage's executive vice president, Joe Maddalena, said the auction house was contacted by people who said they'd discovered it a storage unit, and when it was brought into their Beverly Hills office, he and a colleague \u201cinstantly knew that it was the real thing.\u201d They reached out to Roddenberry, who said he appreciates that everyone involved agreed returning the model was the right thing to do. He wouldn't go into details on the agreement reached but said \u201cI felt it important to reward that and show appreciation for that.\u201d Maddalena said the model vanished in the 1970s after Gene Roddenberry loaned it to makers of \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture,\" which was released in 1979. \u201cNo one knew what happened to it,\" Rod Roddenberry said. The 3-foot (0.91-meter) model of the USS Enterprise was used in the show's original pilot episode as well as the opening credits of the resulting TV series, and was the prototype for the 11-foot (3-meter) version featured in the series' episodes. The larger model is on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. The original \u201cStar Trek\u201d television series, which aired in the late 1960s, kicked off an ever-expanding multiverse of cultural phenomena, with TV and movie spinoffs and conventions where a fanbase of zealous and devoted Trekkies can't get enough of memorabilia. This USS Enterprise model would easily sell for more than $1 million at auction, but really \u201cit\u2019s priceless,\" Maddalena said. \u201cIt could sell for any amount and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised because of what it is,\" he said. \u201cIt is truly a cultural icon.\u201d Roddenberry, who was just a young boy when the model went missing, said he has spotty memories of it, \u201calmost a deja vu.\u201d He said it wasn't something he'd thought much about until people began contacting him after it appeared on eBay. \u201cI don't think I really, fully comprehended at first that this was the first Enterprise ever created,\u201d he said. He said he has no idea if there was something nefarious behind the disappearance all those decades ago or if it was just mistakenly lost, but it would be interesting to find out more about what happened. \u201cThis piece is incredibly important and it has its own story and this would be a great piece of the story,\u201d Roddenberry said. Thankfully, he said, the discovery has cleared up one rumor: That it was destroyed because as a young boy, he'd thrown it into a pool. \u201cFinally I\u2019m vindicated after all these years,\" he said with a laugh.",

            "date": "2024-04-18 10:32:00",
            "content": "If you always thought your garden-variety heist movies could do with a bit more blood-sucking vampire, have we got a flick for you. \u201cAbigail,\u201d featuring a 12-year-old tutu-wearing member of the undead, is way better than it should be, a gleeful genre-smashing romp through puddles of gore. Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett and producer Chad Villella \u2014 part of Radio Silence Productions \u2014 have cracked the modern horror code with such hits as \u201cReady or Not,\u201d \u201cScream\u201d and \u201cScream VI.\u201d They do not disappoint with \u201cAbigail,\u201d even perhaps opening a new, bloody revenue stream. (And wait for the phone call scene, a nod to \u201cScream.\u201d) \u201cAbigail\u201d starts with an odd assortment of mercenaries \u2014 played by \u201cScream\u201d veteran Melissa Barrera, \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d star Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton, Kevin Durand, William Catlett and the late Angus Cloud. The six \u2014 representing the muscle, sniper, computer expert, getaway driver, medic etc \u2014 are hired to kidnap a rich preteen (nicknamed \"Tiny Dancer\") and hold her for ransom. The rules are: No names. No backstory. No grabass, which is a weird request, if we're being honest. All this group needs to do is detain the target for 24 hours until rich dad pays $50 million in ransom. Why are six professional underworld characters needed to snatch and detain a sweet preteen, still wearing her tutu? That's easy: Not all of them are going to survive to claim their share of $7 million. That's because Abigail (Alisha Weir, awesome, stay away from me, no seriously) is really into, well, neckwork. \u201cI'm sorry about what's going to happen to you,\u201d Abigail sweetly tells the kidnappers. We have some idea \u2014 and it's going to be great. Suddenly, the rambling estate they're holding her becomes a prison. The tables are turned. The script written by Stephen Shields (\u201cThe Hole in the Ground\u201d) and regular Radio Silence collaborator Guy Busick (\u201cReady or Not\u201d and the \u201cScream\u201d movies) \u2014 gleefully mines humor in the horror. Laughing a moment after a body fully explodes is normal here. \u201cThis whole thing is a trip,\u201d says one of the gang. Believe them. \u201cSomething doesn't add up,\u201d says another. Believe that guy, too. Garlic, sunlight, spears and crucifixes are employed to try to stop Abigail, who has hijacked the heist movie and turned it into a run-for-your-life thriller. She's a very smart 12-year-old who turns hardened mercenaries against each other. Barrera, who had been so central to the life of the \u201cScream\u201d franchise, shows why she's so good at horror \u2014 funny, sarcastic, vulnerable, athletic, soulful and very convincing with a stake in her hand. Stevens, who famously left the aristocratic \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d for better roles, may wonder what he's doing here now, bathed in blood fighting a preteen vampire, but does an admirable job, definitely in on the camp. But it's Weir in the titular role who carries it, doing pirouettes and leaps as she chases the bad-guys-now-good guys to the theme of \u201cSwan Lake\u201d with blood dripping down her throat, rotten teeth and feathers in her hair. \u201cI like to play with my food ,\u201d she says. Run faster! \u201cAbigail,\u201d a Universal Pictures release that hits theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong bloody violence and gore throughout, pervasive language and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 110 minutes.

            "title": "Choctaw artist Jeffrey Gibson confronts history at US pavilion as its first solo Indigenous artist",
            "date": "2024-04-18 08:10:00",
            "content": "VENICE, Italy -- Jeffrey Gibson\u2019s takeover of the U.S. pavilion for this year\u2019s Venice Biennale contemporary art show is a celebration of color, pattern and craft, which is immediately evident on approaching the bright red facade decorated by a colorful clash of geometry and a foreground dominated by a riot of gigantic red podiums. Gibson, a Mississippi Choctaw with Cherokee descent, is the first Native American to represent the United States solo at the Venice Biennale, the world\u2019s oldest contemporary art show. For context, the last time Native American artists were included was in 1932. Gibson, 52, accepts the weight of the honor, but he prefers to focus on how his participation can forge greater inclusion going forward. \u201cThe first is not the most important story,\" Gibson told The Associated Press this week before the pavilion\u2019s inauguration on Thursday. \u201cThe first is hopefully the beginning of many, many, many more stories to come.\" The commission, his first major show in Europe, comes at a pivotal moment for Gibson. His 2023 book \u201cAn Indigenous Present\" features more than 60 Indigenous artists, and he has two major new projects, a facade commission for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and an exhibition at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. Gibson\u2019s eye-catching exhibition titled \u201cthe space in which to place me,\" features text in beadwork sculptures and paintings taken from U.S. founding documents, music, sermons and proverbs to remind the viewer of the broken promises of equity through U.S. history. The vibrant use of color projects optimism. In that way, Gibson\u2019s art is a call to action. \u201cWhat I find so beautiful about Jeffrey\u2019s work is its ability to function as a prism, to take the traumas of the past and the questions about identity and politics and refract them in such a way that things that realities that have become flattened \u2026 can become these beautiful kaleidoscopes, which are joyous and celebratory and critical all at the same time,\" said Abigail Winograd, one of the exhibition\u2019s curators. \u201cWhen I see people walk through the pavilion and kind of gasp when they walk from room to room, that\u2019s exactly what we wanted,\" Winograd said. Entering the pavilion, the beaded bodices of sculptures in human form are emblazoned with dates of U.S. legislation that promised equity, the beading cascading into colorful fringe. A painting quotes George Washington writing, \u201cLiberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth,\" in geometric letters that meld into a colorful patterned background. By identifying specific moments in U.S. history, Gibson said that he wants to underline that \u201cpeople who are fighting for equity and justice today, we\u2019re not the first. \u201cThis has been a line in the history of American culture. But I\u2019m hoping that people will think about why \u2026 some of these things \u2026 have either been revoked or have not come into fruition,\u201d he said. Craft is at the center of Gibson\u2019s art, both in defiance of past denigration of craft and as a way to confront \u201cthe traumatic histories of Native American people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something very healing about the cycle of making,\" Gibson explained. The pavilion\u2019s intricate beaded sculptures owe a debt to Native American makers of the past without imitating them, employing couture techniques to create something completely new. In the way of his forebears, Gibson uses beads sourced from all over the world, including vintage beads from Japan and China , and glass beads from the Venetian island of Murano. Paper works incorporate vintage beadwork purchased from websites, estate and garage sales in mixed media displays that honor the generations of Native American makers that preceded him. Gibson's themes fit well into the message of inclusion of the main Biennale exhibition, titled \u201cStranieri Ovunque -- Strangers Everywhere,\u201d which runs in tandem with around 90 national pavilions from April 20-Nov. 24. His personal history has placed him firmly in what he calls the \u201cdiasporic history of Indigenous people.\u201d His father's job took his family abroad when he was a child to Germany and then South Korea, and he later studied in Chicago and London. His partner is Norwegian artist Rune Olsen. Through all of this, Gibson has picked up traditions and practices that go beyond his Indigenous background. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at op art, pattern and decoration. I've looked at psychedelia, I have taken part in rave culture and queer culture and drag and the whole spectrum,\" Gibson said. \"And so for me, I would not be telling you the whole truth if I only chose to speak about indigeneity. But my body is an Indigenous body \u2014 it\u2019s all funneled through this body,'' he said. \u201dAnd so my hope is that by telling my experience, that everyone else can project their own kind of intersected, layered experience into the world.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-19 16:17:00",
            "content": "As we welcome the warm weather in April, the Pink Moon will open up new beginnings as we head towards the summer. Celebrity astrologer Kyle Thomas, who is known for his cosmic guidance among celebrities, businesses and online influencers, spoke to \"Good Morning America\" about the best ways to take advantage of this resourceful full moon. First, let's break down the meaning of the Pink Moon. When is the Pink Moon in 2024? According to Thomas, the Pink Moon will reach peak illumination on Tuesday, April 23, at 7:48 pm E.T. MORE: What is March's full Worm Moon? What it means for your zodiac sign Why is it called the Pink Moon? The Old Farmers' Almanac , which first began publishing the names for the full moons in the 1930s, states that some eastern Native American tribes refer to the full Moon in April as the \"Pink Moon\" because the name originates from the moon's correspondence with early springtime wildflowers. According to NASA , this Moon is also known by other names include the Sprouting Grass Moon, the Egg Moon, and among coastal tribes the Fish Moon, as \"this was when the shad swam upstream to spawn.\" Other tribes reportedly also named the moon based on signs of spring. For example, the Old Farmer's Almanac states that some Native American tribes referred to the April full moon as the \"Breaking Ice Moon\" and \"Moon When the Ducks Come Back.\" What zodiac sign is the Pink Moon in April? The zodiac sign for each full moon is determined by where the moon is positioned in the night sky relative to the different astrological signs. This year, the Pink Moon is positioned as a full moon in Scorpio, a water sign ruled by intimacy, sexuality, the shadow self and the occult. As a zodiac sign, Thomas said Scorpio brings great attention to how we share resources in our lives and within the world. \"Striking a balance between what we give and receive will be extremely important and any imbalances within these themes will be tremendously important to face,\" he added. Rituals and manifestations to try during the Pink Moon The full moon was dubbed \u201cPink Moon\" because the name originates from the moon's correspondence with early springtime wildflowers. ABC News Photo Illustration From Chinese traditions to Hebrew holidays, many ancient cultures celebrate celestial cycles and often revere the power of the moon. Thomas said because Scorpio is a water sign and deeply focused upon intimacy, sexuality, vulnerability, sharing, and rebirth, these energies are amplified in the collective. Since the sign is also connected to assets, investments, and big money matters, rituals focused around these themes would be powerful. Due to Scorpio being a water sign, using emotional transmutation and alchemy for manifestation can be quite potent. \"However, using liquids, such as water, essential oils, and lotions can also be effective,\" Thomas said. Potential meditations, mantras or journal prompts: I release myself from my fears, traumas, and insecurities. I open myself to true intimacy and vulnerability. I will not let my past failures or fears in regard to love control me. I am a phoenix, always ready to be reborn and renewed.

            "date": "2024-04-22 03:38:00",
            "content": "Jazmin Evans is one of more than 14,000 Black kidney transplant candidates who found out that an outdated medical test may have inappropriately calculated their need for a transplant. Evans, 29, was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease in January 2012. She started dialysis and was put on the kidney transplant waitlist in 2019. \"I just remember feeling, like, this is never gonna happen for me,\" she said, speaking with ABC News. The U.S. faces a dire kidney organ shortage, meaning patients with kidney failure must meet certain criteria to be considered good candidates for a transplant. One of those considerations is a test called the \"eGFR\" calculation, which is a measure of a person's kidney function. This metric takes into account factors like age, sex, body weight and -- until recently -- a person's race. The decision to include race was based on outdated studies that relied on an assumption that Black patients had differences in kidney function compared to other groups. In many cases, the use of a race-based score may have contributed to Black patients being placed lower on the waitlist. \"That really was problematic, but it was very widely accepted,\" said Martha Pavlakis, former chair of the kidney committee with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, an organization that administers the transplant system in the U.S. and maintains transplant policies. \"It was what we were taught. It was what we turned around and taught other people.\" MORE: Doctor shines spotlight on inequalities in US medical system on Black patients In 2020, the National Kidney Foundation and American Society of Nephrology established a national task force to reassess how race is taken into account when diagnosing kidney related illnesses. The task force's final report outlined guidance stating that race variables shouldn't be applied to kidney transplant candidates, which the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network later implemented. As a result, some people suddenly found themselves higher on the waitlist. In January 2023, the algorithm evaluating kidney disease changed, eliminating race as a factor. Evans said she was shocked when she received notice of her movement up the transplant list in 2023. She shared the news on TikTok at the time, showing a letter stating that she was eligible for a \"waiting time modification.\" \"My original wait time started April of 2019,\" she says in the TikTok video. \"With the new calculation for Black Americans, my 'start date' would have started [in] 2015.\" \"At this point, I am eight years on the transplant list,\" she continues. \"For my blood type, the average waiting time is about four to five years. I could've [had] a kidney already.\" Evans' story is just one of many examples of health inequities historically ingrained in the kidney transplant system. STOCK IMAGE/Getty Images \"Everyone says, you know, we live in this post-racial society here in America, but that's really not the truth,\" Evans said, speaking with ABC News. The 29-year-old, who finally received a new kidney in July 2023, has since dedicated her TikTok account to kidney health advocacy and education. Michelle Josephson, former president at American Society of Nephrology, called the inclusion of race factors in the previous kidney transplant waitlist evaluations inappropriate. \"Race is a social construct and it should not be included in these [tests],\" she said. \"It's not appropriate.\" Dr. Samira Farouk, a transplant nephrologist and volunteer at the National Kidney Foundation, echoed that sentiment, stating that race is not a risk factor for kidney disease. \"One risk factor that is related to race is the racism,\" Farouk said, \"so, thinking about decreased access to care and decreased access to medications, decreased access to optimal diabetes, and high blood pressure control.\" MORE: More Black physicians could improve life expectancy of Black patients: Researchers Carole Johnson, administrator at the Health Resources and Services Administration, said the agency had long heard from families and people in the transplant field that there was room for improvement in the evaluating systems. \"Families were waiting too long and individuals were struggling with the system,\" she said. \"It is absolutely unacceptable that there would be anything in the algorithm for allocating organs that would in any way be weighted based on race, without the science to support that.\" Editor\u2019s Picks Black women suffer disproportionately from 'superwoman schema' Michael Strahan, athletes discuss mental health in the Black community GMA_Med Unit Black maternal health week story_230412 As a result of the evaluation changes, 14,280 Black kidney transplant candidates were moved up the waitlist between January 2023 and mid-March 2024, according to Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data. Of that group, nearly 3,000 have received a kidney transplant. Experts say this is an example of identifying the inappropriate use of race in medical care. \"We not only attempted to eliminate it from influencing care, but [can look at it] and say, for those people for whom it may have impacted their care, can we fix that?\" Pavlakis said. The inequities don't end with kidney transplant waitlists, nephrologists pointed out. Racial biases also exist in calculations for the kidney donor profile index, which determines the quality of a donor kidney for a transplant. \"It really goes back to this initial assumption that race is a biological variable [which isn't accurate],\" Farouk said. MORE: Video Hospital organization tackling racial bias in medicine A new mandate is in the works which would omit the race bias in calculations for kidney donor allocations. An Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network vote to change the biased donor test is set for June. \"There's a lot of issues in medicine and many other parts of our culture that speak to our very challenging history. And I think this is one of them,\" Josephson said. \"The good news is that we have pulled race out and we've tried to rectify some of the inequities that occurred because of it.\" Evans, too, said she feels \"hopeful\" for the future, adding that she hopes the changes end up \"bringing more equity to the donation process or the transplant process.\" Ashley Yoo, M.D., a member of the ABC Medical News Unit and an internal medicine resident at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Red Lobster is in hot financial waters, attempting to stay afloat by eyeing Chapter 11 bankruptcy to restructure its debts after an endless shrimp promotion sank the seafood restaurant chain's bottom line, Bloomberg reported this week. According Bloomberg , the restaurant is considering filing for Chapter 11 on the advice of law firm King & Spalding, which would allow the chain to stay open while dealing with its debt and help reevaluate long-term contracts and leases. The outlet reported that Fortress Investment Group, one of Red Lobster's key lenders, is also involved in current debt negotiations. A waitress carries a tray a lobster kettle and a crab trio dish at a Red Lobster restaurant in Yonkers, New York, July 24, 2014. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images The chain recently added Jonathan Tibus as its new CEO. Tibus has worked with other restaurant chains to restructure their businesses through the Chapter 11 process, including Kona Grill, which filed for bankruptcy in 2019, and the fast foot chain Krystal, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2020. Last year, Red Lobster reported $11 million in operating losses following its flubbed \"Ultimate Endless Shrimp\" deal, which backfired when it reeled in too many customers after the limited-time promo became a permanent menu fixture last June. The restaurant chain later reported $12.5 million in losses in the fourth quarter of 2023. A sign is posted on the exterior of a Red Lobster restaurant on April 17, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.

It has been a painful journey. But in the pain we have found peace.\" \"God continues to comfort and hold us in his arms,\u201d their statement continued. \"The prayers from the community around us have been so sustaining in this difficult season.

It affects about 1 in 175 births in the U.S. each year. Unlike miscarriage, where a baby dies before the 20th week of pregnancy, stillbirth refers to when a baby dies at or after the 20th week of pregnancy. Stillbirth, as the CDC notes, can occur in women of any age, ethnicity, race, or socioeconomic background. Certain factors may increase the risk of stillbirth including being Black, 35 or older, smoking, having a pre-existing medical condition such as diabetes or high blood pressure, or a previous pregnancy loss.

            "title": "Bahamas' 11 best budget beachfront hotels",
            "date": "2018-06-14 04:04:00",
            "content": "Hundreds of islands and cays that comprise the Bahamas have long been a tropical playground for the rich, super-rich, and mind-bogglingly rich. Be that as it may, it is quite possible for the non-A-listers of the world to find a quiet slice of Bahamian paradise to call their own -- and to do so without sending their savings into a nosedive. Here's how to get started: Take a look at these 11 heavenly and affordable hideaways, each one posted up on a spectacular beach where the sand is snowy white and the water miraculously bright blue. 1. Pigeon Cay Beach Club, Cat Island Pigeon Cay Beach Club Oyster.com Intimate Pigeon Cay Beach Club is located on the largely undeveloped Cat Island (130 miles southeast of Nassau), where it's possible to wander the gorgeous coastline for miles without spotting a soul -- or a boat, dock, or Jet Ski. A similar end-of-the-world ethos is found at this tiny, charmingly ramshackle hotel, where seven rustic cottages face a beautiful beach with vibrant teal water that truly merits the word \"stunning.\" TVs, AC, and Wi-Fi are all happily off-duty, leaving guests to explore the island by bike, canoe, or kayak (all free to use) or quietly drop by the honor-system beach bar. Meals can be served at the bar, on the beach, or in the cottages, which all have full kitchens and furnished outdoor spaces. 2. Shannas Cove Resort, Cat Island Shannas Cove Resort Oyster.com Located up a dirt path, Shannas Cove Resort is a rambling, relaxed hilltop resort with lovely ocean views and natural grounds full of palms, flowers, and ferns. Shannas' five bungalows are nothing fancy, but they feature private furnished porches with dazzling ocean views. (They lack Wi-Fi and Pigeon Cay's kitchens, but do have mini-fridges and TVs with a few channels.) Like Pigeon Cay, Shannas' highlight is its big beach, which has free water sports, ivory sand, and calm, seemingly unnatural turquoise water. Guests usually have the beach to themselves, or just about, and there's a nature trail off the resort that leads to more deserted, drop-dead gorgeous beaches. For all its solitude, however, Shannas isn't without a social element: In the evenings, fellow guests tend to gather in the restaurant's bar. 3. Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat, Paradise Island Sivananda Ashram yoga Retreat Oyster.com Pay no mind to the cruise ships tooting Disney horn songs in the harbor and the Atlantis resort mini-city down the beach. Tucked between these monster tourist entities is Sivananda, a serious ashram with a regimented schedule of yoga and meditation. Days begin with a 5:30 a.m. gong, waking guests for morning satsang -- meditation, chanting, singing, and lectures -- followed by a two-hour yoga class on an open platform on the beach or by the harbor. After class comes the first of two lacto-vegetarian meals, then free time, when guests can attend extra workshops or lounge on the white-sand beach. Next up, more yoga, dinner, and the evening satsang. Accommodations range from camping and tent huts to beachfront suites (most rooms have shared bathrooms, though). The twice-daily yoga, meditations, and buffet-style meals are all included in the price, which, for those pitching their own tents or staying in one of the platform tents, can be extremely low. 4. Small Hope Bay Lodge, Andros Small Hope Bay Lodge Oyster.com The eco-friendly Small Hope Bay Lodge has some of the most reasonable rates on Andros Island -- the largest of the Bahamas, but a place made up mostly of impenetrable bush, inland waterways, and mangrove marsh. Despite its rugged and secluded location, Small Hope's all-inclusive structure means that rates cover all meals, bar drinks, regular beverages, and nightly conch fritter hors d'oeuvres. Sailing, kayaking, windsurfing, paddleboarding, and biking are all free, plus guests can embark on dive trips (including wreck and blue hole dives) near and around Andros Barrier Reef, the sixth-largest in the world. Small Hope's beachfront cabins feature wood-beamed ceilings and whitewashed walls, as well as Danish-style lounge chairs, woven rugs, and local Androsia Batik fabrics. 5. Compass Point Beach Resort, Nassau Compass Point Beach Resort Oyster.com Compass Point Beach Resort may be New Providence Island's most interesting property. The resort was opened in 1995 by legendary music producer Chris Blackwell, who owned a nearby recording studio where Bob Marley, Eric Clapton, and the Rolling Stones all laid down tracks. Between studio sessions, many famous artists would crash at Compass Point Beach Resort. The resort's appearance is as noteworthy as its history: It's composed of 18 rainbow-colored huts inspired by Junkanoo, the Bahamian street parade. All rooms have surround-sound music systems and balconies, and some include open-air kitchenettes, dining spaces, and second bedrooms. Daily housekeeping comes at a fee, but freebies include Wi-Fi, self-parking, and continental breakfast at the hip, breezy restaurant with impressive ocean views and regular live music. Compass Point is on stunning Love Beach, a mile-long stretch of milky sand that is one of the loveliest beaches on the island. It's a great spot for snorkeling, and its out-of-the-way location means that it's rarely crowded. 6. Pineapple Fields Resort, Eleuthera Pineapple Fields Resort Oyster.com First-timers to Pineapple Fields Resort, keep your eyes peeled. This mellow condo complex has an obscure entrance along a back road in central Eleuthera, an already sleepy place with an extra-chilled-out Bahamian vibe (precisely why many -- including royalties and VIPs -- choose the island as a vacation destination). The property feels almost desolate during the day, as most guests are off at one of the island's many beaches, horseback riding in the surf or along inland trails, or napping by the outdoor pool. Things pick up at night, however, when locals and guests make their way to fun, friendly Tippy's for sunset cocktails on the deck and seafood served from an open kitchen. 7. Cape Santa Maria Beach Resort & Villas, Long Island Cape Santa Maria Beach Resort & Villas Oyster.com Stationed at northern end of Long Island, Cape Santa Maria Beach Resort & Villas has the sort of show-stopping beach that seems attainable only to made-of-money jet-setters. It's long and wide and ridiculously scenic, with pristine white sand and calm turquoise shallows. The hotel does cater to moneyed travelers with its 1,800-square-foot villas, but also to budgeteers, who can book one of the cheaper bungalows, all with a private veranda and gorgeous ocean views. An on-site restaurant and bar serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and between meals and bouts on the beach, guests can fish, dive, snorkel, bike, and nature cruise. (Bikes and kayaks are free to use.) 8. Unique Village, Eleuthera Unique Village Oyster.com Staying on mogul-magnet Eleuthera can take a toll on your bank account. Luckily, the island has a handful of humble, homey properties with palatable prices, like Unique Village. This 14-room hotel stands proud over the quiet Poponi Beach, which is rarely crowded despite being well-known for its stunning pink sands. Unique Village has a casual open-air restaurant and an outdoor pool, and its spacious, air-conditioned rooms have simple and bright island decor, free Wi-Fi, and outdoor terraces -- many facing the ocean. 9. Stella Maris Resort Club, Long Island Stella Maris Resort Club Oyster.com If you're looking for casual, cheerful, and cheap, the beachfront Stella Maris Resort Club more than fits the bill. The large, family-owned complex on beautiful and remote Long Island is a bargain for its competitive rates, free activities, and accommodations that can suit larger parties (there are 27 hotel rooms, cottages, houses, and villas). Rough waves and rocky shores make Stella Maris' beach unswimmable, but the clear, turquoise-blue expanse makes a beautiful backdrop. Plus, there are three on-site pools and free shuttles to a swimmable beach. One of the highlights of the resort is its range of activities, many of which are free, including day trips, boating, nature walks, caving, kayaking, and rum punch parties. 10. Paradise Cove Beach Resort, Freeport Paradise Cove Beach Resort Oyster.com On the flip side of the classic big-box beach resort is Paradise Cove. This family-run and authentic spot on the western coast of Grand Bahama has just two villas, both two-bedroom units with kitchens, living rooms, and screened-in porches facing the sea. The resort is along Deadman's Reef -- home to some of the best snorkeling on the island (keep an eye out for sea turtles, reef sharks, and moray eels). There are no resorts in sight; guests looking for peace and quiet will be happy to discover this hidden gem. 11. St Francis Resort, Stocking Island St. Francis Resort Oyster.com Want to go off the grid? Stocking Island is just about as remote as you can get. The island is only accessible by boat (a ten-minute ride from George Town), and has little human development: no cars, no roads, and about two dozen residents. What it does possess is pristine nature in the form of blue holes, hiking trails, and empty white-sand beaches. The quiet and homespun St Francis Resort fits right in with its surroundings, offering eight spacious rooms overlooking the ocean, two beaches, and free kayak and Hobie Cat rentals. It's not all peace and quiet: The bustling restaurant draws plenty of boaters and day-trippers and the hotel hosts activities like poker nights, trivia, karaoke, and weekly barbecues. In-room breakfast, Wi-Fi, and transport from George Town are all free.",

We definitely want to do something special the rest of the season. It's been a long season and long process with a lot of ups and downs.\" Since August, Risacher has played in over 60 games across several different competitions, more than any player in this draft class, with possibly two more months still in store as the French playoffs kick off in mid-May. \"I'm feeling good physically,\" Risacher said. \"I always make sure my body feels right for playing games at the highest level. There were some moments in the season where I felt a little more tired due to the number of games, which sometimes include two or three per week, with difficult travel.

He plays a mistake-free, intelligent style with outstanding instincts on both ends of the floor, making him an easy player to fit into virtually any NBA team's roster with his versatility, but still has significant potential to grow into with his developing frame and youthful demeanor. \"There are a lot of things I can bring an NBA team,\" Risacher said. \"First of all -- my number one strength is my shooting. Then my defensive ability after that. And lastly, my ability to do what's asked of me, using my versatility -- I can rebound, handle the ball if needed, finish above the rim, pass the ball.

Inter are 14 points clear of second-placed Milan with six league games left to play. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) The game between the local clubs, known as the Derby della Madonnina , will be particularly hard-fought given that they are level on 19 titles apiece as it stands. \"We've had a magnificent ride, tomorrow could be a very important day for all of us but we're not experiencing it as an obsession,\" Inzaghi told a news conference on Sunday. \"We had a dominant season; now the climb is about to end but we know what we have done.\" Inter are technically the away side for the game, though the teams share the San Siro as their home ground. For Monday's game, Milan fans will have a much larger allocation as they look to help their team delay Inter's title party. Inter have enjoyed the better of the clash in recent times.

Milan coach Stefano Pioli told his players to see the derby as an opportunity. \"We can use all the terms we want: pride, responsibility and belonging. For the league table, for Thursday's elimination, for Inter's Scudetto , it's a chance for redemption, for pride,\" Pioli said in his Sunday news conference. \"We will need the best Milan possible. There are those who think that we have never changed in the derbies, but tomorrow we have to do everything we can so that they don't win. \"We will need to play an exceptional game, we come off the back of five consecutive defeats against them and they have always given us problems.\" Inter's status as champions-elect in Serie A has been established for several weeks now, with Inzaghi's team having scored the most goals in Serie A while also boasting the meanest defence. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez 's impressive return powered the Nerazzurri 's attack, scoring 23 goals to be the front-runner for the Capocannoniere , with Marcus Thuram and Hakan Calhanoglu both reaching double figures. The wing-back system employed by Inzaghi, with Benjamin Pavard , Alessandro Bastoni and Stefan de Vrij 's stability allowing Federico Dimarco and Denzel Dumfries to push forward, has proved more than effective in nullifying opponents. Should Inter be held by or lose to Milan, the next chance for them to clinch the league title would be against Torino on Sunday or Sassuolo on May 5.

            "date": "2024-04-21 23:49:00",
            "content": "MILWAUKEE -- With the clock winding down toward the end of the first quarter, Bucks point guard Damian Lillard put an exclamation point on his Game 1 masterpiece. With a crossover, he created space and stepped back into a 28-foot 3-pointer, a vintage move from Lillard to knock down a shot past the outstretched hand of Pacers guard T.J. McConnell as the first-quarter buzzer sounded. Lillard then trotted down the court, basking in the adulation of a sold-out crowd at Fiserv Forum. \"What time is it?\" the public address announcer asked. \"Dame Time!\" the crowd roared. \"This is what y'all brought me here for,\" Lillard yelled to the crowd as he beat his chest. With two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined by a calf strain, Lillard carried the Bucks to a 109-94 victory over the Pacers on Sunday in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series. Lillard finished with 35 points, all in the first half, to help build Milwaukee a halftime cushion that was never threatened. \"In the playoffs, it's about setting the tone,\" Lillard said. \"We're going to see this team a lot of times, and you want to establish yourself, especially on your home floor. That was my mentality, to come out and try and set the tone in that way.\" Game 2 is Tuesday night in Milwaukee. Lillard's 35 points in the first half were the second-highest total by any player in the first half of an NBA playoff game in the past 25 years, trailing only Kevin Durant 's 38 points in 2019, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. Lillard set a playoff career high for points in a half and scored more points than any Bucks player in a first half since Antetokounmpo in the 2021 NBA Finals. \"He carried us,\" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \"He was unbelievable.\" Even with Lillard going scoreless in the second half while the Pacers forced the ball out of his hands, his teammates were able to pick up the slack. Khris Middleton scored 23 points on 9-of-14 shooting, while Bobby Portis added 15 points and 11 rebounds. But it was the aggressive way Lillard came out that helped carry the Bucks. \"I've seen that on television a lot,\" Middleton said. \"He came out, threw the first punch and really got us off to a great start with a great lead that lasted the whole game.\" Related Stories Damian Lillard's 35-point 1st half helps Bucks beat Pacers 109-94 without Giannis in playoff opener Apr 21, 9:43 PM Lillard's unusual night in Bucks' win includes 35 points in first half and 0 in second half Apr 21, 8:54 PM Antetokounmpo's injury casts shadow over Bucks' first-round series with Pacers Apr 20, 4:38 PM Lillard nearly matched Indiana (42 points) in the first half as the Pacers, who finished second in the NBA in offensive efficiency during the regular season, struggled to generate points in their first playoff game. They missed their first 12 3-pointers, and their 42 points were their fewest in any half this season. It was the first time Indiana shot below 40% in a game this season. Pascal Siakam scored 36 points, but Tyrese Haliburton was limited to nine points and nine assists, while his teammates shot 9-of-26 off his passes. \"Everybody was active, followed the game plan,\" Rivers said. This was the 10th straight postseason loss for the Pacers, dating back to the 2017-18 season. \"It's easy to just say we missed shots and now we're nervous or whatever,\" Haliburton said. \"Whatever you all are going to run with, it doesn't matter. I just feel like we missed shots, at the end of the day. The ball wasn't hopping. And they made shots in the first half and that kind of dug us a hole.\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was more succinct. \"The first half was embarrassing,\" he said. \"No excuses. We've simply got to come out better. It was ugly, and we all own it.\" Milwaukee took a 1-0 lead in the series without Antetokounmpo, who has not played since April 9, when he strained his left calf. Rivers said before Game 1 that he did not have any clarity on when Antetokounmpo would be ready to play again. So the Bucks needed this kind of performance from Lillard, who was traded from the Portland Trail Blazers to Milwaukee a week before the start of training camp. His first season in Milwaukee was filled with ups and downs, adjusting to a new team and playing next to another superstar for the first time in his career. Lillard averaged 24.3 points on 42% shooting (35.4% from 3) in 73 games during the regular season, a down year by his lofty standards. But after getting through the regular season, Lillard said he felt the excitement this week of entering his first playoff run with Milwaukee and a chance to compete for his first championship. \"The last two years not being in the playoffs, it sucked,\" Lillard said. \"Early vacations. Last year, I went to Coachella. I ain't never been able to go to Coachella. \"Just having that long summer, I was over that. Being able to be in a playoff series on a championship team, championship organization, knowing that we got an opportunity for it, that was the thing I was looking forward to most.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-21 20:59:00",
            "content": "LOS ANGELES -- LA Clippers point guard James Harden said he still has something to prove during the postseason in his highly productive career. With Kawhi Leonard out for Game 1, Harden had his best first half as a Clipper, scoring 20 of his 28 points to help L.A. build a 29-point lead en route to a 109-97 win over the Dallas Mavericks at Crypto.com Arena on Sunday. \"I can score with the best of 'em,\" Harden said. \"Still can score with the best of 'em. My role for this team is just generating really good shots and making guys' jobs easier. And then when my number to score is called, then you score the basketball. Obviously, Kawhi is out, so my playmaking and my volume is going to go up a little bit more, and took advantage of it.\" Despite going without Leonard in the first-round series opener because of inflammation in his surgically repaired right knee, the Clippers put together one of their most inspired performances of the season. Ivica Zubac set the tone early inside and finished with 20 points and 15 rebounds. The energy and activity on both ends from Russell Westbrook and Terance Mann were critical. And Paul George scored 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter to help close it out. But it was Harden's first-half outside shooting that really provided the Clippers with a different element. Coach Ty Lue spoke to Harden in April when Leonard missed the final eight regular-season games about needing him to score more. Related Stories Harden and Zubac lead Leonard-less Clippers to 109-97 win over Doncic and Mavs in playoff opener Apr 21, 6:14 PM Clippers rule out Kawhi Leonard for Game 1 vs. Mavericks Apr 21, 2:19 PM Lue, Clippers still don't know Leonard's status for Round 1 Apr 20, 4:29 PM Harden scored 20 in a win over the Denver Nuggets and 22 in a come-from-behind win over the Cleveland Cavaliers late in the season. That carried over to Game 1, when Harden was aggressive and looked for his shot, something he shied away from on several occasions this season as he has tried to be more of a playmaker. \"A huge element,\" Lue called Harden's scoring for the team. \"When he's scoring the basketball and making the right play, it's huge. He understands that he doesn't have to do a lot of heavy lifting with Kawhi and PG both on the floor. But if one of those guys are out, he has to step up and be aggressive to score the basketball. That is what he has been doing for us of late. I thought he really set the tone early.\" Harden scored 42 or more points in two games during Philadelphia's Eastern Conference semifinals loss to Boston last year. But in the team's losses in Games 6 and 7, he shot only 7-for-27 and had combined for 22 points and 16 assists. He had nine points, seven assists and six rebounds while shooting 3-for-11 in Philadelphia's 112-88 loss in Game 7 at Boston. On Sunday, Harden didn't just score, he also posted eight assists. All told, he scored or assisted on 49 points for the Clippers, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. With Leonard's status for Game 2 uncertain, Harden may have to help carry the scoring load again. \"James was great,\" Zubac said. \"We needed him and he played great. He is one of the greatest scorers this game has seen. He can do that on a nightly basis. It's just the role is different for him in this game and [with Leonard out], we need him to score more and that's what he did and we all know he can do that.\"",

Roach entered the portal Tuesday night, and it wasn't long before Baylor emerged as the favorite for the senior guard. Arkansas , St. John's , Kentucky , Villanova , Syracuse and others were quickly linked to Roach, but Scott Drew and the Bears won out. Roach made his announcement in a post on Instagram. A 6-foot-2 Virginia native, Roach started 108 games over four seasons with the Blue Devils, earning third-team All-ACC honors as a senior. A former McDonald's All American in the 2020 class, Roach was immediately thrust into an extended role in Durham, North Carolina. He averaged 8.7 points as a freshman and 8.6 points as a sophomore, coming on strong down the stretch of the 2021-22 campaign to help lead Duke to the Final Four. Roach enjoyed a true breakout season as a junior, boosting his numbers to 13.6 points and 3.1 assists and again playing some of his best basketball late in the season. He had 23 points against Virginia in the ACC title game then scored 23 against Oral Roberts in the first round of the NCAA tournament.

He scored in double figures in all four NCAA tournament games, with Duke getting knocked out by NC State in the Elite Eight. Roach should take over lead guard duties in Waco, Texas, from day one with RayJ Dennis out of eligibility. Baylor brings back returning starter Jayden Nunn and double-figure scorer Langston Love on the perimeter while also adding elite recruit V.J. Edgecombe and top-25 prospect Robert Wright III . Drew and Baylor also have positioned themselves well for former Tennessee big man Jonas Aidoo , another top-10 transfer.",

            "content": "The NBA unveiled the three finalists for each of its seven major individual awards for the 2023-24 regular season Sunday night, headlined by Nikola Jokic , an MVP finalist for a fourth straight season, and San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama ,\u00a0a finalist for Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. Jokic, whose Denver Nuggets opened the playoffs with a victory over the Los Angeles Lakers Saturday night, won the MVP in 2021 and 2022 and finished second behind the Philadelphia 76ers ' Joel Embiid last year. Embiid and the Milwaukee Bucks ' Giannis Antetokounmpo were MVP finalists alongside Jokic each of the past two seasons, but they were replaced this season by Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic . Jokic concluded the regular season averaging 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists for Denver, which finished tied atop the Western Conference with Gilgeous-Alexander's Thunder. Oklahoma City claimed the West's top playoff seed on a tiebreaker. Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.0 steals this season. Doncic led the league in scoring, averaging 33.9 points, to go along with 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists for the Mavericks, who opened their first-round series against the LA Clippers with a 109-97 loss Sunday. There were no surprises among the finalists for Rookie of the Year, with the top two picks in the 2023 draft -- Wembanyama and Charlotte Hornets forward Brandon Miller -- joined by the 2022 second overall pick, Thunder center Chet Holmgren . Wembanyama set several records in his first season with the Spurs, averaging 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocks and 1.2 steals, while Holmgren averaged 16.5 points and 7.9 rebounds for Oklahoma City after missing last season with a foot injury. Miller averaged 17.4 points and made 184 3-pointers this season. Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert , who previously won three Defensive Player of the Year awards and was a finalist from 2017 to 2022, leads this year's finalists, alongside\u00a0Wembanyama and Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo . Gobert led Minnesota to the league's best defensive rating and averaged 12.9 rebounds and 2.1 blocks. Adebayo, one of the league's most versatile big men, averaged 10.4 rebounds plus a steal and a block per game, while Wembanyama became a block and steal machine as a rookie, especially after shifting to center full-time midway through the season. The field for Most Improved Player, often one of the more complicated awards in terms of voting because there's no set criteria, includes 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey , Chicago Bulls guard Coby White and Houston Rockets center Alperen Sengun . Maxey made his first All-Star team while averaging 25.9 points and 6.2 assists. White averaged career highs of 19.1 points and 5.1 assists, and Sengun averaged 21.1 points, 9.3 rebounds and 5.0 assists for Houston. The Sixth Man of the Year voting, meanwhile, was led by Sacramento Kings guard Malik Monk , Timberwolves center Naz Reid and Bucks\u00a0forward Bobby Portis . Monk averaged 15.4 points and 5.1 assists for Sacramento before missing the final weeks of the season with a knee injury. Reid has developed into one of the top-scoring bench bigs in the league, averaging 13.5 points and 5.2 rebounds -- both career highs -- to help Minnesota clinch the third seed in the Western Conference. Portis averaged 13.8 points and 7.4 rebounds for the Bucks and will step into a much bigger role in Milwaukee's first-round series against the Indiana Pacers , with Antetokounmpo sidelined at the start because of a calf injury. For the second straight year, Oklahoma City's Mark Daigneault finished among the top three in Coach of the Year voting, joined by Orlando Magic coach Jamahl Mosley and Minnesota's\u00a0Chris Finch. Under Mosley, a young Magic team boasted one of the league's best defenses and claimed the Southeast Division crown. And Finch led Minnesota to 56 wins, second most in franchise history. Bulls forward DeMar DeRozan is a repeat finalist for the Clutch Player of the Year award, which was created last year. He's joined by Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry and Gilgeous-Alexander. The NBA will announce each of the award winners -- as well as the selections for the All-NBA, All-Defense and All-Rookie teams -- over the next couple of weeks.",

            "content": "LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers slugger Shohei Ohtani has broken Hideki Matsui 's record for the most homers hit by a Japanese-born player in Major League Baseball. Ohtani crushed a two-run homer deep into the right-field bleachers off Adrian Houser of the New York Mets in the third inning of L.A.'s 10-0 win Sunday at Dodger Stadium. The homer was the 176th of Ohtani's six-plus seasons in the majors. That's one more than Matsui, the former New York Yankees slugger who played the final 10 seasons of his 20-year pro career in North America. \"Honestly, I was just relieved I was able to get it over with,\" Ohtani said through his interpreter, Will Ireton. Ohtani admired and emulated Matsui while growing up in Japan during the prime of Matsui's MLB career. Yet Ohtani said the record was \"not something I was cognizant of when I first started my career here, but as I got to know about it,\" he began to pay attention to his place behind Matsui. When Ohtani was asked whether he also hopes to emulate Matsui's famed playoff poise if and when he finally reaches the MLB postseason, Ohtani joked that he currently is more focused on breaking manager Dave Roberts' record for the most homers by a Japanese-born player in a Dodgers uniform. Roberts leads Ohtani 7-5 in that competition. \"Hideki Matsui was a great ballplayer, a great home run hitter, a world champion,\" Roberts said. \"I know that Shohei admired him, so for him to eclipse that mark, it's a big deal. I know whatever kind of mark is ahead of Shohei, he's trying to take them all down.\" Ohtani's record-breaking blast was hit 423 feet with a 110 mph exit velocity, and it put the Dodgers up 2-0. Ohtani hadn't homered in his previous seven games, but he went 2-for-3 with a single, a walk and two runs scored in the Dodgers' blowout victory, which snapped a three-game losing streak. \"We just tried a backdoor slider with that, and just wasn't able to keep it out [of the strike zone],\" Houser said. \"You leave a pitch down the middle to him, he's going to put a good swing on it, just like he did.\" The homer was Ohtani's fifth in his first 24 games for the Dodgers, who signed the two-time American League MVP to a $700 million contract last winter. Ohtani hit 171 homers in six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels . \"It's awesome,\" teammate Tyler Glasnow said. \"I'm sure he'll have a lot more records while we're playing here.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The Bar\u00e7a coach has announced he will step down at the end of the season , but there had been a growing clamour for him to stay before this week's Champions League exit to Paris Saint-Germain and the loss to Madrid. \"It's not the moment,\" Xavi said when asked about his future. \"We have to digest this defeat and think about Valencia in our next game. There are still six matches to play, and there is work to be done. The objective is to be in the [Spanish] Super Cup again next season [by finishing in the top two]. \"LaLiga is 38 games long, and you have to congratulate [Madrid].

            "date": "2024-04-21 18:59:00",
            "content": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas -- Nelly Korda couldn't have imagined the incredible run she's put together this season while at home recovering from a blood clot that required surgery in 2022. \"Because obviously then I was just more scared for my health,\" she said. \"Competing was kind of on the back seat. I was not thinking about competing at all. But I think all of the sad times and the health scares that I have gone through have made me who I am today.\" Fully healthy now, Korda is seemingly unstoppable. The world's No. 1 player hasn't lost a tournament since January, and now she's a two-time major champion. Korda etched her name in the LPGA Tour record books Sunday, winning her record-tying fifth straight tournament with a 2-stroke victory in the Chevron Championship. Korda joins Nancy Lopez (1978) and Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) as the only players to win five consecutive LPGA events. Her previous major victory was in 2021 at the Women's PGA Championship. \"It's been an amazing feeling these past couple weeks knowing that I can go on this stretch and that if I stay in my bubble and I keep golf in a sense simple and let it flow, then I can have so, so much fun out here,\" she said. Korda shot a 3-under 69 in the final to outlast Maja Stark of Sweden, who birdied her final two holes to shoot 69 and pull within 1. Korda stayed aggressive on the par-5 18th, easily clearing the lake in front of the green and setting up an easy up-and-down birdie. She had a four-day total of 13-under 275 at Carlton Woods. Korda nearly aced the par-3 17th, with her tee shot hitting the hole and hopping in the air before settling within 10 feet. She settled for par to maintain her 2-shot lead. Korda wowed the large crowd, which followed her throughout the day, by chipping into the wind for birdie on the par-4 10th hole to take a 4-stroke lead. The 25-year-old raised her club above her head with one hand and pumped her fist after the ball rolled into the hole. Her parents -- former Australian Open tennis champion Petr Korda and Regina Rajchrtova -- beamed as she was presented with the trophy. \"She had a difficult '22 and '23 in certain ways,\" Petr Korda said. \"She did not win a tournament in '23 and some things probably made her humble and [she] put a lot of work into where she is right now. Without the work and commitment, she would not be here. So seeing that, I'm very happy.\" Korda's older sister, Jessica, is a six-time LPGA winner who's taking a break from golf after giving birth to her first child. Korda took home $1.2 million from a purse of $7.9 million, a significant increase from last year's purse of $5.2 million. That brings her season earnings to $2,424,216 and her career earnings to $11,361,489. Winners had been jumping into Poppie's Pond off the 18th green at Mission Hills since 1988, and Korda became the second to do it in Texas by doing a cannonball off a small dock into brown-tinged water. World No. 2 Lilia Vu was first to jump into the pond here after her win last season. Vu withdrew from this year's tournament before the first round after experiencing \"severe discomfort\" in her back during warmups. While still shivering from her post-win plunge Sunday, Korda confirmed she'll be competing in the JM Eagle LA Championship next week in Los Angeles. She was then asked about the possibility of becoming the first to ever win six straight LPGA tournaments. \"I'm going to enjoy this right now and then I'll think about that,\" she said. \"But yeah, it's been an amazing time. Hopefully keep the streak alive. But I've been so grateful to compete week in and week out and get the five in a row, too.\" Sorenstam, speaking to Golf Channel later Sunday, commended Korda for the accomplishment. \"So proud of her to win five in a row and to make a major her fifth,\" she said. \"It's great for women's golf. I'm super happy for her. It's hard to win once on tour, and then twice, so to do it five times is a really hard thing to do. I'm just so proud of her and happy for her.\" Asked what advice she'd give Korda as she chases a record sixth win in L.A., Sorenstam added: \"Just keep going. It really doesn't matter what you've done in the past. You just have to start over and keep going. ... The hardest part isn't so much physically, it's mentally.\" Masters champion Scottie Scheffler is on a similar tear, on his way to a fourth victory in five starts until rain interrupted the final round of the RBC Heritage. He couldn't help but check in on Korda. \"I actually was checking the scores this afternoon when we were in the rain delay,\" he said. \"I'm extremely happy for her and proud of her. That's some pretty special stuff. It's been a treat to watch.\" Korda entered the last round 1 shot off the lead after completing the last seven holes of the weather-delayed third round early Sunday morning on a windy and unseasonably cool day. She was wiped out after her big win because she'd been up since 4 a.m. to prepare for the end of the third round. She birdied two of her first four holes to take the lead. Lauren Coughlin birdied Nos. 13 and 14 to get within 2 strokes, but bogeys on the 16th and 17th holes put her 4 behind. She shot a final-round 68 to finish tied for third with Brooke Henderson. Coughlin got emotional when discussing her best finish in a major. \"It's really cool to see all of the work that I've put in, especially with my putting and my short game, and putting specifically showed off this week, as well,\" she said. Henderson was tied with Korda for second to start the last round after she shot a 64 in the third round to set a scoring record for the tournament since its move from Mission Hills, California, to Texas last year. But the Canadian, who has 13 LPGA wins with two majors, also faltered early in the final round, with a bogey and a double-bogey in the first four holes. Haeran Ryu of South Korea shot a bogey-free 67 to enter the final round leading Korda by 1. But the 2023 Rookie of the Year bogeyed the first two holes of the fourth round. She closed with a 74 and finished fifth. Eighteen-year-old amateur Jasmine Koo provided an unlikely highlight on the 18th hole. Her second shot bounced off the advertising board in the water and back into play. She ended up with a birdie to shoot 71. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.",

            "content": "BOSTON -- Celtics star Jayson Tatum was a catalyst in more ways than one in Boston's convincing 114-94 victory over the Miami Heat on Sunday afternoon in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series. He played smart, unselfish basketball against Miami's double-teams, logging his first career playoff triple-double with 23 points, 10 boards and 10 assists. But as the contest entered its final minute, Tatum also showed toughness, popping up off the floor immediately after getting hit by Heat wing Caleb Martin while going airborne for a rebound. The play initially scared the TD Garden crowd but galvanized the Celtics, who wanted to show they wouldn't be pushed around by the highly physical Heat club. \"It's playoff basketball, and it's a physical game against a physical team. S---'s gonna happen,\" Tatum said, adding that he wanted to get up from the fall quickly to show he wasn't hurt. \"It's probably not the last time I'm going to get hit like that in this series.\" After the game, Martin said he didn't intentionally collide with Tatum and that his momentum simply led him into the airborne Tatum. Replays showed that Boston's Jrue Holiday might have pushed Martin from behind in the moment before the collision. Martin sought to help Tatum up afterward, but Boston star Jaylen Brown pushed him away before he could. Martin and Brown were assessed technical fouls after exchanging words. For as dangerous as the play initially looked, with Tatum appearing to come down on his hip -- and nearly slamming his head on the hardwood -- the Celtics suggested the skirmish might create a rallying effect going forward. \"I was excited about the whole situation,\"\u00a0Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I enjoyed watching it.\" Said center Kristaps Porzingis : \"I think we matched [their physicality]. I don't know if [the Martin collision] was an accident or not. Those kinds of plays happen. But a little bit of action? I think it's good for the playoffs. It was fun.\" As far as action was concerned, the Celtics brought far more of it from the outset. Porzingis said the club -- which lacked meaningful games at the end of the regular season after clinching the East's No. 1 seed with three weeks left to play -- spoke earlier in the week about not showing rust and finding a way to throw the first punch in Game 1.

It sets the stage for the rest of our path.\" The message clearly got through, as the Celtics poured it on early by jumping out to a 14-0 lead before Miami scored its first points. The Heat began settling in and clawing back, but the path to doing so was complicated by Boston's preference for 3s when most of Miami's shots were of the 2-point variety. The floodgates opened in the third when the Celtics, with ball movement and ample floor spacing, drilled seven 3s and outscored the Heat by 17 in the quarter. Through three quarters of play, Boston had knocked down 19 3s to Miami's five -- a 42-point margin from behind the arc. Tatum facilitated much of the offense by letting the Heat's zone attack pressure him with two defenders before quickly swinging the ball back across the floor to a more open shooter. Porzingis, Derrick White and reserve Sam Hauser each finished with four 3s, while Brown knocked home three of his own. The Celtics led by as much as 34 early in the fourth, and Boston fans began doing the wave inside the arena. The first-round series between the teams -- their fourth playoff meeting in five years -- is a rematch of last year's Eastern Conference finals,\u00a0which the Heat took despite being an eight-seed underdog. The climb this time would be even steeper for Miami. Jimmy Butler , the team's best wing player, injured his right MCL during the play-in round and is expected to miss several weeks. And Terry Rozier , who averaged nearly 20 points per game in the regular season, is out with a neck injury. Both are enormous blows for a Miami unit that already struggled to score at times. \"It's clear Boston controlled this game from the tip,\" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"They won the big muscle areas. Definitely won the 3-point line. And most of the areas in between. ... We have to do a much better job by Wednesday.\"",

            "content": "DENVER -- It remains unclear whether Los Angeles Lakers forwards Christian Wood and Jarred Vanderbilt , who missed Game 1 of their Western Conference first-round series against the Denver Nuggets , will be available to return at any point in the series. Wood has been sidelined since Feb. 14 because of discomfort in his left knee, undergoing arthroscopic surgery on March 19. He averaged 6.9 points on 46.6% shooting (30.7% from 3) and 5.1 rebounds in 17.4 minutes per game prior to the injury. \"All I'll say is he's still going through his recovery process from injury, his rehab process,\" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said on a conference call with reporters when asked about Wood's potential to return. \"Obviously, he has size, he has length, he has rebounding capabilities, he can stretch the floor.

            "content": "NEW YORK -- When Philadelphia 76ers forward Nicolas Batum was asked Sunday what stood out about rewatching his team's Game 1 loss to the New York Knicks , his answer was immediate and short. \"Rebound,\" Batum said. While there were many reasons the 76ers could point to for falling short in a game they had chances to win on the road, it was New York's offensive rebounding that stood out. The Knicks finished Game 1 with a staggering 23 offensive rebounds -- including seven by Mitchell Robinson alone -- that led to a 26-8 advantage in second-chance points, something that came up repeatedly during Philly's off-day media availability ahead of Game 2 back at Madison Square Garden on Monday night. \"In a playoff game, that's way too much,\" Batum said, referring to the offensive rebounds and second-chance points. \"Win the game. We still had a chance to win the game. That's the worst part it, we still had a chance. \"We've got to control the rebounds, and we knew it. They're maybe the best, no, the best, at that in the whole league. They played great, they play aggressive and they go chase every ball, and they did that last night, so we lost on that.\" That Philadelphia struggled in that area in Game 1 wasn't a shock, as it was a potential pivot point entering the series. The Knicks were the league's best offensive rebounding team this season, with both Robinson (tied for first) and Isaiah Hartenstein (seventh) ranking in the top 10 individually in the league. Philadelphia, partially because Embiid missed half the season, ranked 25th in defensive rebounding percentage. Embiid, meanwhile, has not been as aggressive as he normally is on the boards since returning earlier this month from a two-month layoff after a procedure on the lateral meniscus in his left knee. Put that together, and Philadelphia now is spending the 48 hours between Games 1 and 2 examining how that gap can be narrowed as it attempts to tie the series at a game apiece. \"A lot of things got confirmed from what we all saw live,\" 76ers coach Nick Nurse said with a smile, when asked what rewatching the tape from Game 1 showed him. \"Listen, we did a couple things really, really well, as far as schematically and what we were trying to do. We didn't do one thing very well. \"We let them play to one of their strengths, like, absolutely to the max.\" The question now shifts to what the 76ers do to combat it? Nurse hinted at the possibility of Paul Reed and Embiid playing together some in Game 2. He also spoke to some general changes that Philadelphia could employ to better keep New York off the glass. \"You're talking about better blocking out,\" Nurse said. \"More physical blocking out, getting more people involved. Try to outnumber the guy and then at some point you gotta jump. You gotta be able to match their athleticism and jump. The ball goes up between all of us right now, whoever jumps the highest might get it, you know what I mean? So at some point we gotta do that as well.\" Nurse also downplayed any issues with Embiid's knee moving forward after he briefly left Game 1 . \"Pretty good,\" Nurse said when asked how Embiid was feeling Sunday. \"I think. I mean, I asked him how he's feeling and he said, 'Pretty good.'\"",

            "content": "BOSTON -- The Bruins aren't committing to a goaltender for Game 2 of their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Monday even after Jeremy Swayman 's dominant 35-save performance in Saturday's 5-1 victory in Game 1. Boston has used Swayman and Linus Ullmark in strict rotation during the regular season, and Boston's coach Jim Montgomery may keep that pattern alive in the playoffs, too. \"We're still contemplating that and [deciding] if that's the way to go,\" said Montgomery following the Bruins' team meeting Sunday. Montgomery tapped Swayman over Ullmark for Game 1 because Swayman \"hadn't had the opportunity to start a series before in the last couple years ... he did really well.\" That wasn't surprising given Swayman's excellence against Toronto in the regular season, posting a 3-0-0 record and .959 SV% in those previous outings. Swayman held the Leafs mostly at bay again in a near-flawless performance Saturday, with David Kampf 's third-period strike the only blemish -- when Boston was already leading 4-0. If Swayman hasn't officially gotten the call yet for Monday's game, it's clear he impressed Montgomery.

We win 5-1. But if we decide to go with Ullmark, we're comfortable with it and our team's comfortable with it.\" It was Swayman's ability to shut down the Leafs' top skaters -- including this season's Rocket Richard Trophy winner Auston Matthews -- that caught Montgomery's attention and the way Swayman stood tall in tense moments. \"I thought his athleticism allowed him to make some really bouncing puck rebound saves,\" Montgomery explained. \"He made a couple point-blank saves early, and then I thought we got to our game. So, it was really important he made those saves.\" Choosing to stick with Swayman's hot hand or go back to Ullmark will be the Bruins' next critical decision. Ullmark was solid in the regular season with a 22-10-7 record and .915 SV%. Montgomery rode Ullmark for most of the Bruins' first-round series against the Florida Panthers last year, leaving Swayman out until Game 7 behind a lengthy 17-day layoff between starts. The Bruins -- who won last season's Presidents' Trophy as the league's top points-getters -- fell that night to the Panthers and were eliminated from the postseason. This year Montgomery's strict rotation means Swayman hasn't played two games in two days since February. But based on Swayman's postgame reaction Saturday, he'll have no trouble rallying to get back in the crease. \"[It was] a dream come true,\" he said. \"Taking that first lap, hearing the fans ... it's a pretty emotional feeling. You just understand how hard it is to get here and what a great opportunity it was. I couldn't wipe the smile off my face the whole night. Pretty spectacular.\"",

            "content": "The Los Angeles Angels placed Anthony Rendon on the 10-day injured list Sunday due to a left hamstring strain, adding another chapter to the third baseman's checkered medical history with the team. Rendon, 33, came up limping after legging out an infield hit to open the Angels' game against the host Cincinnati Reds on Saturday. He left the game, with his single raising his batting average to .267 with no home runs, three RBIs and three stolen bases in 19 games. Rendon opened the season by going 0-for-19 in five games before batting .357 (20-for-56) over his past 14 games. \"[I'm feeling] not too great,\" Rendon said after the game. \"Frustration. Anger. Mad. Any of those adjectives you want to use.\" He said it's frustrating to be hurt now that he's heating up at the plate. \"I'm starting to barrel the ball more, and when I didn't, I was just starting to find holes,\" Rendon said. \"Like earlier in the season, I was barreling it, and they were catching it. I think that's the most frustrating part, I was getting into a groove and, of course, this happens.\" Rendon has not played more than 58 games in a season due to a variety of injuries and the COVID-19 pandemic since signing a seven-year, $245 million contract with the Angels. Rendon was an All-Star while playing for the Washington Nationals in 2019. He finished third in the National League MVP voting in 2019. That season, he set career highs with a .319 batting average, 34 homers and 126 RBIs, the latter leading the majors along with 44 doubles. For his career, Rendon is batting .283 with 158 homers and 660 RBIs in 1,135 games. In a corresponding move Sunday, the Angels selected the contract of veteran infielder Ehire Adrianza from Triple-A Salt Lake. Adrianza, 34, batted .238 in 616 career games for the San Francisco Giants (2013-16), Minnesota Twins (2017-20), Atlanta Braves (2021-22, 2023) and Nationals (2022). In another move, right-hander Robert Stephenson . 31, was transferred to the 60-day IL on Sunday. The team had announced Thursday that he will undergo season-ending elbow surgery later this month. Stephenson, who had signed a three-year contract worth $33 million in January, was placed on the IL on March 28.",

Both sides hit the woodwork in a rollercoaster extra 30 minutes -- Fernandes for United and Simms for Coventry, his effort bouncing down off the underside of the crossbar. Coventry's 36,000 fans were sent into delirium when substitute Victor Torp poked home with almost the last kick of the game but what would have been a deserved winner was disallowed for a slender offside after a VAR check.

They will now face Manchester City in the showpiece final on May 25 -- the first time the same two clubs have contested the FA Cup final in consecutive years since 1885. It was desperately tough on Coventry who looked down and out when Fernandes made it 3-0 before throwing caution to the wind to stun Erik ten Hag's side. Coventry, managed by former United Cup winner Mark Robins, were the better side towards the end of the game and the superb Simms struck the underside of the crossbar deep into extra time.

            "content": "DENVER -- As much as the story of the Los Angeles Lakers ' season has been centered on the team looking to make up for its flameout in the Western Conference finals a year ago to chase a championship, there's also been a personal redemption arc for point guard D'Angelo Russell . However Saturday's 114-103 Game 1 loss to the Denver Nuggets , where Russell missed 13 of his final 16 shot attempts and scored 13 points, brought to mind some of his past struggles. \"D-Lo is a huge reason why we're here in the first place,\" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. \"I'm not going to bail out on my player just because he's missing the shots that he normally makes. So same shots were going in against New Orleans [in the play-in tournament] and other games that he's played in to help us get to this point. So it just wasn't his night.\" After seeing his role reduced throughout the four-game sweep by the Nuggets last year and losing his starting job before the closeout game, Russell re-signed with Los Angeles in the offseason. He survived the trade deadline without being dealt, and his play from early January through the end of the regular season was a bright spot for a Lakers team that came into the first round having won 12 out of 15 games to secure the No. 7 seed. His overall production has been night and day compared to the 6.3 points on 32% shooting (13% from 3) and 3.5 assists he put up against the Nuggets last May. But his numbers on Saturday -- 30% shooting (6-for-20) and 11.1% from 3 (1-for-9) with 3 assists -- echoed that nightmare of a series for him. \"I mean, I can't be mad,\" Russell said. \"I don't recall the last time I got 20 shots. So for me to get 20 good looks -- not 20 'good,' probably five or six of them were questionable. I know what I'm capable of. So honestly, I'm excited. I'm excited about that.\" Related Stories Michael Porter Jr.: Team 'had my back' after brother's sentencing Apr 21, 1:19 AM Brittney Griner, wife Cherelle expecting 1st baby Apr 14, 5:25 PM Anthony Edwards drops 33, lets Suns know in Timberwolves win Apr 20, 9:19 PM Excitement would seem counterintuitive considering the Nuggets have now won nine straight games against the Lakers and host Game 2 on Monday at Ball Arena, where they tied for the second-best home record in the league during the regular season, going 33-8. Yet Russell insisted on taking a pragmatic view. \"I just feel like sometimes the ball just don't fall,\" he said. \"I was locked in on the details and the little things just to try to stay on the floor defensively and things like that. And you look up, your shots aren't falling. So no love lost. Can't be upset about that one. Be ready for the next one.\" Russell's shot was far from the only thing that failed the Lakers in the series opener. Denver dominated Los Angeles on the boards 49-40 and scored 18 points off 15 offensive rebounds (the Lakers mustered just eight second-chance points).\u00a0The Nuggets had half as many turnovers as the Lakers, six to 12, and outscored Los Angeles 14-8 following their opponent's miscues. Anthony Davis , who led the Lakers with 32 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 blocks but still saw the Nuggets outscore his team by 12 in the 45 minutes he played, said he will encourage Russell to keep his focus on the next opportunity. \"Just get ready for Game 2,\" Davis said. \"We can't do anything about this. But you can do something about Game 2. We know what D-Lo brings to our team. Offensively, he can score, shoot the ball extremely well. Just got to do it.\"",

            "title": "Ryan Garcia scores 3 knockdowns in wild upset of Devin Haney",
            "date": "2024-04-21 01:39:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- Ryan Garcia's fitness to fight was questioned in the lead-up to his bout with Devin Haney, a turbulent promotion that was highlighted by Garcia's erratic comments . Garcia (25-1, 20 KOs) was a major underdog and virtually counted out entering Saturday evening. His blinding, powerful left hook turned the tide as Garcia scored three knockdowns to pull the upset via majority decision at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. One judge scored the bout 112-112 but was overruled by scores of 114-110 and 115-109 for Garcia. However, Garcia wasn't eligible to win Haney's WBC junior welterweight title after he weighed 143.2 pounds Friday for the 140-pound contest. Haney remains the champion in defeat, but it's Garcia who scored the career-best win by knocking off ESPN's No. 6 pound-for-pound boxer. \"I don't give a f--- what people say about me. I walked through the fire and still held it down and still beat f---ing Devin Haney and still drink every day,\" said Garcia, 25. \"Not necessarily am I proud of that, but I'm just saying it was a statement to show you, you guys can't really f--- with me.\" Haney was a -900 favorite earlier in the week, according to ESPN BET, but he closed at -575. Garcia pretended to drink a beer at Friday's weigh-in and paid Haney upward of $600,000, sources told ESPN, as part of the deal for the fight to proceed. One day earlier, Garcia had made a bet with Haney and agreed to pay him $500,000 for every pound he weighed in at above 140. Haney later said Garcia honored the bet, which would mean Garcia paid Haney a total of $1.5 million. In the opening minute of the fight, as a harbinger of what was to come, Garcia was the one who made Haney pay with a ripping left hook that rocked the champion. Haney (31-1, 15 KOs) quickly recuperated and went on to outbox Garcia over the next four rounds. He even wobbled Garcia in Round 3 with a right hand while Garcia boxed off a back foot and looked for another counter left hook that would change the fight. Garcia found it in Round 7 as he floored Haney -- the first time he has been on the canvas in 32 pro fights -- but Garcia didn't capitalize. Moments after the knockdown, as the crowd erupted, Garcia crushed Haney with a right hand on the break and was deducted one point by referee Harvey Dock. \"It was a horrible ref,\" said Garcia, who fights out of Southern California. \"[Haney] was holding me for dear life, and I felt an opportunity to keep swinging while my hands were free and I cracked him. And then he took a point away when I cracked him, but [Haney] held me and then I should have knocked him out in that seventh round. \"They stole that from me. ... And Devin was holding and holding and holding. ... That was ridiculous. That was crazy. I never seen some s--- like that.\" What should have been a two-point advantage for Garcia was nullified. It didn't matter. Garcia floored Haney again in Round 10, this time with a tremendous right hand, the same punch he used to wobble Haney in Round 6. The following round, Garcia landed his money punch again, a counter left hook that rolled Haney's eyes as he was launched backward to the canvas. Somehow, he sprung back up, his cheeks badly swollen, his mouth bloody. Garcia went for the finish, but Haney was able to stave him off and heard the final bell in one of the most surprising and dramatic fights in recent memory. \"I'm disappointed about my performance,\" said Haney, 25, during his postfight interview. \"I [showed I] was a true champion and I could fight after being knocked down.\" \"He caught me early when I was sleeping on him,\" he added. \"He caught me by surprise. I fell asleep on the left hook. ... I gave him a shot. It's only right he gives me a shot back.\" Garcia often used a shoulder roll where he exposed his back, a tactic he vowed to never use again after he ineffectively deployed it in his eighth-round KO win over Oscar Duarte in December. The defensive method didn't work again, but he still was able to neutralize Haney's elite jab by countering over the top. Haney told ESPN on Thursday he was unsure at times during training camp that the fight with Garcia would even happen. \"We're here now. That's all that matters,\" he said then. \"The stuff he's doing is not normal. It's obvious that something is wrong with him. But what he does outside the ring does not matter. It won't change what I'm going to do to him inside the ring.\" Haney had plenty of reason to be confident. He retained his undisputed lightweight championship with a razor-thin unanimous decision over future Hall of Famer Vasiliy Lomachenko in May. Afterward, Haney, who fights out of Las Vegas, moved up to 140 pounds for a December fight with Regis Prograis. Haney won via shutout on all three cards in his junior welterweight debut and even dropped the champion en route to a title in a second division. Haney entered Saturday's bout ranked No. 1 by ESPN at 140 pounds. Garcia, meanwhile, lost in his only previous bout on the elite level, a seventh-round KO defeat by Gervonta Davis in an April 2023 superfight. A body shot put Garcia down for the count. But one year later, Garcia proved that he too is an upper-echelon fighter capable of beating the best. Maybe all the turbulence during the promotion aided Garcia in some paradoxical way. \"There's fighters who need that chaos,\" Garcia's promoter, Hall of Fame boxer Oscar De La Hoya, told ESPN earlier this month. \"There's fighters who perform much better when there's chaos. It almost blinds you from reality.\" Garcia was required to undergo a mental health evaluation by the New York State Athletic Commission last week and passed. He previously said he felt the decision was unfair and \"demeaned\" him. He has openly talked about his anxiety and depression in the past. In April 2021, Garcia withdrew from a bout with Javier Fortuna to address his mental health. \"I've backed off a fight before,\" Garcia said last week. \"I know when I actually have an issue, and I don't.\" Garcia and Haney first crossed paths when they were 11-year-olds plying their craft in the amateurs. The first time they met inside the ring was May 2012, months before they both turned 12. Garcia won that amateur bout via unanimous decision in Southern California. Before Saturday night, the last time they fought was January 2015. Haney won that three-round contest in the same fashion. They were 16 then. Nine years later, Garcia broke the stalemate and won the only fight between them that truly mattered.",

            "content": "Denver Nuggets forward Michael Porter Jr. says his teammates have had his back in recent days amid the sentencing of his younger brother Coban Porter to six years in prison for a drunken driving crash that killed a woman in Colorado last year. The sentencing Friday came just two days after another of Porter's younger brothers, Jontay Porter, was banned from the NBA amid a betting scandal. \"Definitely tried to compartmentalize, some bad and sad stuff happened to a couple of my brothers. But I got, you know, 15, 16 more brothers in here, so I knew I had to be here for them and come in here and do my job and try to prepare to do it at a high level,\" Porter said Saturday night after his Nuggets went up 1-0 in their first-round series against the Los Angeles Lakers . Porter missed Nuggets practice Friday to testify on his brother's behalf at his hearing. Coban Porter had pleaded guilty in February to vehicular homicide and vehicular assault as part of a plea agreement.\u00a0According to The Denver Post, prosecutors on Friday said Coban Porter was speeding at the time of the crash and had a blood alcohol level of .19, more than twice the legal limit of .08. Michael Porter Jr. said each of his teammates texted him and told him \"that they got my back if I needed anything, they got me.\" \"To have these guys understand why I missed practice yesterday and just had my back has been big for me,\" he said. Porter had a strong game in the 114-103 victory over Los Angeles, scoring 19 points to go along with 8 rebounds in 38 minutes. \"It's a hard thing to do, but I think when you're on the court, you don't think about it,\" Nuggets star Nikola Jokic said of Porter after the game. \"That's why basketball is such a beautiful thing, that you don't think about nothing except what's going on on the floor. Before and after of course the stuff hits you, but we all reached out to him. It's a thing that of course family is the first thing, but we are some kind of family too. \"Hopefully he's going to find peace and be in a good spot mentally.\" Porter has been with the Nuggets since they drafted him in 2018 out of Missouri . He missed the majority of his lone season with the Tigers and his entire rookie year in Denver with back injuries. He also missed all but the first nine games of the 2021-22 season after another back issue required him to get another surgery. However, he has bounced back in the years since and played a career-high 81 games for the defending champions this season. \"We're human. We carry our emotions and things that go on off of the court onto the court, but I'm mentally tough. I've been through a lot through my whole career, so you know it was another one of those things I had to play through,\" Porter said.",

            "date": "2024-04-20 23:49:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- All season, the New York Knicks have gone as far as Jalen Brunson could carry them. But when Brunson had an uncharacteristically off night against the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday at Madison Square Garden, his teammates were there to pick up the slack. There was Josh Hart hitting a season-high four 3-pointers, including three in the final quarter. There was Brunson's backup, Deuce McBride , going for 21 points and finishing with a game-best plus-37. And there was Mitchell Robinson coming off the bench to grab seven of New York's 23 offensive rebounds. They all played significant parts in New York's playoff-opening 111-104 victory. \"It's definitely encouraging,\" said Hart, who matched Brunson with a team-high 22 points. \"We've been on his shoulders all season. And when he struggled, that's when we had to pick up. \"When your top dog is not playing well -- not shooting well, I didn't want to say not playing well -- you need other guys to pick it up for him, and that's what we did.\" Brunson shot just 8 for 26 from the floor, including 1 of 6 from 3-point range, to go with seven rebounds, seven assists and five turnovers. But on a night when he and the rest of the Knicks starters finished with negatives in the plus-minus column, it was the contributions from others -- and especially the bench -- that allowed New York to hold home-court advantage to begin this Battle of Interstate 95. \"They played phenomenal from the start to finish,\" Brunson said. \"Whenever they were in they made plays. A credit to them for their preparation.\" New York's starters struggled because Philadelphia generally was able to control the game when Joel Embiid was on the court. In his 37 minutes, Embiid had 29 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists, and Philadelphia outscored the Knicks by 14. Related Stories Caitlin Clark helps WNBA shatter draft viewership record Apr 16, 7:29 PM Houses passes billions in foreign aid Apr 20, 4:30 PM Man dies after setting himself on fire near court Apr 20, 9:00 AM In the other 11 minutes, though, it was a different story. New York won those minutes by a score of 29-8, largely powered by a bench unit featuring Bojan Bogdanovic (13 points), Robinson and McBride at the start of the second and fourth quarters. \"Well, we had another one of those second quarter starts where we didn't guard anybody,\" 76ers coach Nick Nurse said. \"We had a hell of a first quarter. We come out to start the second quarter, and it is bang, bang, bang. The quarter is off to a bad start.\" Still, even after those struggles -- and with Embiid on the bench dealing with the aftereffects of an injury scare to his knee at the end of the first half -- the 76ers still were leading in the fourth quarter. But then Hart, left wide-open from 3-point range, buried three from deep to help New York surge into the lead for good. \"It felt great,\" Hart said of making those shots. \"The last two games of the regular season, our season series, Nick's game plan was just to play off me and dare me to make shots. I knew that as soon as they won it [the play-in game]. And I knew it would be the same thing with [Erik Spoelstra] if Miami won it. So that's something I knew I had to focus on. \"This whole week was just getting up shots, pre-practice, post-practice. Going back at night. Just getting up shots, getting up reps. So I knew it was going to be that way. Open shots. Fortunately I was able to knock them down.\" As a result, New York escaped with a win to open this series in a game that, in many ways, conformed to the conventional wisdom heading into it. New York, one of the league's best rebounding teams, dominated the glass, gaining a 26-8 edge in second-chance points thanks to those 23 offensive rebounds. The Knicks also had a massive 42-7 advantage in bench scoring, a place Philadelphia routinely has been outgunned at after moving Kelly Oubre Jr. into the starting lineup full-time. Sixers guard Tyrese Maxey , who had a game-high 33 points, was able to get to the rim at will thanks to his blazing speed, while Embiid, when he was on the court, was able to control the action even amid the issues with his left knee. But on a night when the one unexpected thing happened -- Brunson struggling -- the rest of the Knicks ensured that wouldn't cost them home court. \"We need everyone,\" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"Tonight, it was the bench. \"You gotta win games different ways.\"",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- Following a second brief injury scare involving superstar center Joel Embiid in just over a week, Philadelphia 76ers coach Nick Nurse said after Saturday night's 111-104 Game 1 loss to the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden that there are no plans to shut down the reigning MVP. \"He really is a warrior, and he's battling,\" Nurse said of Embiid. \"I think he absolutely wants to play.\" Embiid left the game for the final 2:37 of the first half after a remarkable play that saw him throw down a ridiculous one-handed dunk after passing the ball to himself off the backboard. Embiid, who led all scorers with 18 first-half points, was at the free throw line with Mitchell Robinson guarding him when he dipped under the Knicks center, fired the ball off the backboard and, all in one motion, leaped in the air, caught it with his right hand and slammed it through the hoop. But when Embiid came down, he landed on his left leg and immediately went down to the floor. Play continued, with the Knicks getting a layup at the other end, before Philadelphia could call timeout and take a look at him. After an extended period on the court, Embiid eventually got to his feet and slowly walked off directly to the Philadelphia locker room under his own power, remaining there for the rest of the first half. It was a moment eerily reminiscent of Embiid's exit from a game eight days ago against the Orlando Magic when he drove to the basket in the final two minutes of the first half, scored, went down, walked off under his own power then returned to the floor for the start of the third quarter. And like in that contest, Embiid returned to the bench just before the start of the second half and rejoined his teammates on the floor. \"I knew when I went in at halftime that they were checking him out,\" Nurse said. \"And that he was up and moving. And they did say we are seeing. They didn't rule him out yet. They just took him all the way to the end there to get him ruled back in.\" Embiid declined to talk to the media after the game. He finished the game with 29 points, 8 rebounds, 6 assists and 2 steals in 37 minutes, and Philadelphia was plus-14 in his time on the court -- meaning it was outscored by 21 points in the 11 minutes he was on the bench. However, after Embiid scored 15 points on 5-for-9 shooting in the first quarter, he had 14 points on 3-for-13 shooting over the final three quarters, including going 2-for-11 in the second half. During that Orlando tilt last week, Embiid also struggled after halftime, going for 11 points on 4-for-11 shooting. Saturday's outing was Embiid's seventh since returning to the court following a procedure on the lateral meniscus in his left knee in early February. \"Nothing with Joel surprises me now,\" said Tyrese Maxey , who led Philadelphia with 33 points. \"He's always a fighter. He's always going to try and give it his all for his team. So if he thinks he can go, he'll for sure be out there.\"",

            "content": "MINNEAPOLIS -- With the Target Center pulsating, Anthony Edwards decided to take the temperature of his shooting streak. The Minnesota Timberwolves ' dynamic young superstar, dripping with confidence, had already buried a string of jumpers, becoming more animated after each one widened the score. Then, with 48 seconds left in the game-defining third quarter, Edwards drifted toward the left wing and took aim. Kevin Durant 's infinite wingspan was a touch too late on the closeout, and Edwards' 3-pointer danced through the net, letting loose a deafening roar from a sellout crowd. The Timberwolves' lead stretched to 16, and Edwards, 22, celebrated by bobbing his head up and down, pounding one hand on his chest and shouting at Durant, 35, who shook his head and smiled. The moment electrified the crowd, but it also felt like something more, something with historic gravity -- the future announcing its arrival, perhaps. \"I think everybody here knows that's my favorite player of all time, so that was probably one of the best feelings ever in my whole life,\" Edwards said after scoring a game-high 33 in the Timberwolves' 120-95 Game 1 win against the Phoenix Suns . The Timberwolves' 25-point victory marked their second largest in postseason history, according to ESPN Stats & Information, behind only a 28-point trouncing of the Los Angeles Lakers on April 22, 2003. And Edwards was the catalyst. The former No. 1 pick added nine rebounds, six assists and another notch to his growing legend. Dating to last season, Saturday proved to be his fifth straight playoff game with 25 or more points -- the longest such streak in team history. Edwards' sixth playoff game of 30 or more points also placed him one behind Timberwolves great Kevin Garnett for the most such games in franchise history. But Edwards' biggest impact came in the third quarter, when he scored 18 points -- tied with Sam Cassell for most in a quarter in Timberwolves playoff history -- and notched more field goals (8) than the Suns (6) did as a team. By the end of that quarter, the Timberwolves led by 20 -- just the second time in franchise history that they have led by that much entering the fourth quarter of a postseason contest. The fourth quarter largely amounted to garbage time. Game 2 of the series is Tuesday, with the Timberwolves seeking to escape the first round of the postseason for the first time since 2004. Durant, a 14-time All-Star playing his first full season in Phoenix, led the Suns with 31 points. He acknowledged the obvious in terms of his exchange with Edwards: \"He got it going, he made some tough ones.\" But Edwards, a two-time All-Star, lobbed considerable praise toward Durant.

And if I'm not mistaken, he made four or five straight buckets like it was nothing. And I became a fan at one point. I was out there like, 'Goddamn, he nice.' There's nothing we can do. [ Karl-Anthony Towns ] was playing great defense. Rudy [Gobert ] was playing great defense. \"I'm looking at the stat sheet, he's 11-for-17 [from the field]. He missed six shots and had 31. I mean, he's the greatest to ever do it, man. Big tip of my hat to him, he's the best.\" Indeed, Durant made four jumpers early in the third quarter, but he ultimately took only five shots in the second half. Devin Booker finished with 18 points on 16 shots, but he managed just 1-of-7 from the field when guarded by Jaden McDaniels , the Timberwolves' defensive specialist on the perimeter. Bradley Beal scored 15 points on 10 shots. \"This was probably their best game that we've seen,\" Beal said. \"Respectfully so, it's one game.\" The win marked an about-face for Minnesota, which lost all three regular-season contests to Phoenix by double digits. The most recent defeat came Sunday, when the Timberwolves fell by a nearly identical score -- 125-106 -- compared to what they posted Saturday. \"These guys came here and whooped us in our home court in the last game of the season and were giggling and laughing,\" Edwards recalled. \"Beal, he told our coach that he doesn't think we play hard enough -- and he was right. [Timberwolves coach Chris] Finch didn't like that. He came in the next day and was like, 'Man, you've got guys on the other team telling me that y'all don't play hard enough for me.' And he was totally right. \"We [were] out there just running around letting them do what they want to do. That's a great team. All three of those guys, they're great players, man. It's going to be hard to beat these guys.\" For the Timberwolves, Edwards starred, but the team received well-rounded efforts from Towns (19 points, 7 rebounds), Gobert (14 points, 16 rebounds) and the bench, with Nickeil Alexander-Walker scoring 18 and Naz Reid adding 12 points. Most impressively, the Timberwolves held decisive edges in rebounds (52 to 28), points in the paint (52 to 34) and second-chance points (20 to 6). \"Our focus and our urgency was obviously at an all-time high,\" Gobert said. \"I love how we respected the game plan all 48 minutes, from the first to the last. We tried to not let them get a hot start like they did the three other games and just do what we do.\"",

Avila entered the transfer portal earlier this month with a \"Do Not Contact\" classification, generally an indication a player has made up his mind on where he's attending. \"I will be committing to the Saint Louis University,\" Avila told \"The Field of 68\" podcast. \"I will be going there to play under Josh Schertz again. I trusted his path for me the last two years and trust what he has planned for me these next few years.

            "content": "HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. -- Masters champion Scottie Scheffler was relentless as ever Saturday with another bogey-free round at the RBC Heritage, an 8-under 63 that gave him a 1-shot lead and left him one round from joining some rare company. Not since Bernhard Langer in 1985 has a Masters champion won the following week on the PGA Tour at Harbour Town. The only other Masters champion to win the next week was Gary Player in 1978 at the Tournament of Champions. And the last player to win a major and then win on the PGA Tour the following week was Tiger Woods in 2006 (PGA Championship, WGC-Bridgestone Invitational). \"I think when I'm playing my best, sometimes it feels like I'm competing against myself a little bit out there, trying to keep pushing and stay as focused as I can,\" said Scheffler, who has converted each of his past three outright 54-hole leads on tour. \"At the end of the day, we're out here competing against the best players in the world. I love competing against these guys, and I'm looking forward to the challenge of coming out and competing tomorrow.\" Scheffler was at 16-under 197. Sepp Straka made a 15-foot birdie putt on the last hole for a 65 to get within 1 shot. They will be in the final group Sunday, with a different wind and thunderstorms in the forecast. Two-time major champion Collin Morikawa made one mistake late, coming up short of the 16th green and missing a 10-foot par putt. He had a 68 and was 2 shots behind. Masters runner-up Ludvig \u00c5berg was among those 3 shots back. All of them are chasing the No. 1 player in the world amid a dominant stretch of golf not seen since Woods\u00a0in his prime. Scheffler has gone 51 consecutive holes at par or better at Harbour Town. He posted his 39th consecutive round at par or better dating to the Tour Championship last August. \"I think we all expect him to play well, and there's nothing I can do about it,\" \u00c5berg said. \"All I try to do is focus on myself and make sure that I hit the shots the way I want to and then see where that takes me.\" Scheffler started 3 shots behind and already was tied for the lead with a tee shot to a pin at the back right corner of the 221-yard seventh hole, converting a 10-foot birdie. Related Stories Donovan Mitchell sets Cavaliers' tone with 30 points in Game 1 Apr 20, 6:49 PM Arch Manning stars in Texas Longhorns' spring game Apr 20, 6:39 PM D'Angelo Russell falters late as Lakers drop Game 1 Apr 21, 1:49 AM Even the bad breaks led to birdies. On the reachable par-4 ninth, his drive stopped short of the bunker on a down slope of grass, leaving him a flop shot to a short pin with the green running away from him. All he could manage was a pitch to 35 feet. Scheffler rammed home the birdie putt and never really stopped until finishing with a 7-foot birdie on the 18th. For a moment, it was setting up as a duel with \u00c5berg, the rising Swedish star who has been a pro for 10 months and already is regarded as Scheffler's biggest threat because he never seems to miss. But he missed a drive on the 12th into the trees and made bogey to fall out of a share of the lead, and \u00c5berg had to settle for pars the rest of the way. The crowds were particularly large on the warm, sunny day, often lining the entire fairway two- and three-deep to watch golf's newest sensation. Scheffler has three wins and a runner-up finish in his past four tournaments. The only player to beat him was Stephan Jaeger by 1 shot in the Houston Open -- Scheffler missed a 5-foot putt that would have forced a playoff. They played together for the first time since then, and Jaeger held his own with a 67. Against Scheffler these days, that's just not enough. \"I think I've been very fortunate to have played with a lot of top players,\" said Straka, who played in his first Ryder Cup last fall in Rome. \"I don't think anybody has been quite on the run that Scottie is on right now.\" Scheffler wasn't entirely prepared for this week. Winning can be draining, even more when it involves a Masters green jacket. He flew home to Dallas on Sunday night, spent two days with his pregnant wife, managed nine holes of a pro-am at Harbour Town and here he is again. Patrick Rodgers is the only player within 5 shots of Scheffler who has yet to win on the PGA Tour. The former Stanford star has felt his game was in a good place, and he was hopeful of getting another chance. And then he saw Scheffler's name starting to rise on the scoreboards as he was starting his round. Rodgers hung in there with a 68. \"It feels inevitable at this point,\" Rodgers said. \"His ballstriking is incredible. For me to have a chance tomorrow, I'm going to have to play 18 great holes. And I'm looking forward to the challenge.\" Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-20 18:49:00",
            "content": "CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers star guard Donovan Mitchell got just two or three hours of sleep the night before Saturday's 97-83 Game 1 win over the Orlando Magic . He knew he needed his rest -- especially with a 1 p.m. ET tipoff -- but he couldn't calm his excitement. So he took a late-night drive. During his outing, he came across two kids. They started yelling words of encouragement. That level of enthusiasm is why Mitchell said he loves the first game of the playoffs more than anything. And that eagerness translates to his play as he put up yet another 30-point performance in a Game 1. \"It's all about setting a tone,\" said Mitchell, who had 30 points on 11-of-21 shooting. \"This is exciting and I love it and it's great but in the same token, this game is only one game. This is trying to set that tone but now we have to do it again and again.\" It was the fifth straight Game 1 that Mitchell has scored at least 30 points, tying Alex English for the sixth-longest streak in NBA history and the longest among active players. Only Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Wilt Chamberlain have had longer streaks. \"He's ready for the moment,\" Cavaliers coach JB Bickerstaff said. \"And it's the Game 1s. It's the bigger games during the regular season. Like, he has the ability and the understanding of how important the start is. ... Some people may have that idea or thought and understanding of it. But he's got the ability to time and time [again] go to that space.\" That space also exists outside of Game 1. Through his first 45 career playoff games, Mitchell has had 21 30-point games. Over the past 40 years, only two other players have more such games: Jordan and Allen Iverson.

Mitchell's Cavaliers lost in the first round of last season's playoffs in five games to the New York Knicks . Mitchell also never has made it past the second round. In his second year in Cleveland, Mitchell dealt with multiple injuries and played in just 55 games. His latest setback -- a knee injury -- kept him out almost all of March. Although he struggled initially upon his return, he's \"one percent better every day,\" according to Mitchell. He keeps reiterating how, as much as setting a tone early is needed, the ability to follow it up continuously is even more important. \"This is who I am. That's been my message all year. That's why I'm here,\" Mitchell said. \"But it's one game ... This is who I am -- so now just doing it consistently.\" He continued: \"It's great to get this win how we got it, the way we won, but this is who we are and who we expect to be.\" In addition to Mitchell's scoring, the Cavs got a postseason career-high 16 points and 11 rebounds from Evan Mobley and 16 points and 18 rebounds from Jarrett Allen -- the first 15-point, 15-rebound playoff game from a Cavalier since LeBron James in Game 7 of the 2018 Eastern Conference finals. It helped overcome lackluster shooting from Max Strus as well as the team's 3-point drought of 18 consecutive misses and 17 turnovers. \"As long as we stay here, stay here mentally, all of [our ups and downs] was for this,\" Mitchell said. \"We did it tonight, but we've got to have that attitude until we get four wins. Then another four. Then another four. It's great to feel good, but it's only one. We've got three more times to do this. Then the same thing. Then we've got to do it again.\" ESPN Stats & Information research contributed to this story.",

            "content": "AUSTIN, Texas -- In his most extensive action since arriving at Texas , Arch Manning put on a show in the Orange-White game Saturday, and he didn't take long to do it. Manning threw a 75-yard touchdown on his first pass attempt, started 10-for-10 and finished the first half 11-for-13 for 189 yards with two touchdowns. His first incompletion occurred with 12 seconds left in the second quarter, and his second on a throw off the hands of Isaiah Bond in the end zone. Texas didn't provide statistics, but according to ESPN Stats & Information, Manning finished with 355 yards and three touchdowns with one interception while completing 19 of 26 attempts. At least four of those incompletions were catchable passes. His pocket presence and confidence was an important showing considering Quinn Ewers missed five games in the past two years, backup Maalik Murphy transferred to Duke , and Texas returns just 16% of its receiving production from last season after losing its top five pass-catchers. Sarkisian said the plan all along was to limit Ewers to one or two series, because he is entrenched as a third-year starter after throwing for 3,479 yards and 22 touchdowns with six interceptions as Texas made the College Football Playoff. On Saturday, Ewers' first drive ended with defensive end Colton Vasek tipping a pass that was grabbed by defensive tackle Alfred Collins , who ran it back for a touchdown. Ewers said after the game that he knew his time would be short. \"I know what Quinn's about,\" Sarkisian said. \"Quinn's had a great spring.\" After Manning made an appearance in just two games last season, against Texas Tech in a blowout win and in the final series of the Big 12 title game, he got a chance to take the majority of his team's snaps in this game for the first time. \"I wanted Arch to be able to just go play football. He hadn't really played in a year,\" Sarkisian said. \"When he keeps his eyes up and steps up in the pocket, he can deliver those balls down the field the way we like to play. It was good to see, and it's good to see some of the guys around him play with him the way that they did. \"We're very fortunate at the quarterback position to have a third-year starter to have the backup that we have.\" Related Stories Sarkisian: Bama thoughts fleeting, Texas set for 'epic' run Apr 17, 9:09 PM Justin Pippen, son of Scottie Pippen, commits to Michigan Apr 19, 6:39 PM Tennessee Vols wrap up spring practice with Nico Iamaleava finally under center Apr 13, 1:32 AM Sarkisian told ESPN's Chris Low this week that Manning has been patient, despite his famous last name and the proliferation of quarterback transfers around the country. \"The majority of guys like Arch have always been the best their whole life,\" Sarkisian said. \"Then they get to college and it's like, 'Wait, I'm not the starter?' No, but we're going to develop you in a way that when you do become the starter, you're going to play great. You're not going to have to go through some of these growing pains that some of these other guys go through with their freshman and sophomore year. We're going to keep training you in a way that when your number does get called, you're going to play really good football.\" He did that on Saturday, but Sarkisian also praised the performance of true freshman quarterback Trey Owens, a four-star recruit who helped offset Manning's performance on the other team in a game Sarkisian called \"the most exciting spring game I've ever been a part of.\" \"Not to take a shot of those that put stars on quarterbacks, but I trust our evaluation, and we could probably recruit any quarterback in the country,\" Sarkisian said. \"But Trey Owens is really talented and can make a lot of throws, so I'm very encouraged with where we're at, at the quarterback position.\" The Longhorns were excited to see the performance of freshman Ryan Wingo, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound wide receiver from St. Louis who was No. 33 in the 2024 ESPN 300. Wingo caught two touchdowns. Sophomore DeAndre Moore caught Manning's 75-yarder to open the game. Bond, the Alabama transfer who led the Crimson Tide with 48 catches last season, worked his way into the offense. Sarkisian possibly foreshadowed some transfer portal priorities when he said the Longhorns still need more \"big humans\" along the defensive line after losing NFL draft prospects T'Vondre Sweat , the Outland Trophy winner, and Byron Murphy II . But otherwise, he feels really good about the Longhorns' outlook. \"I think we're a very talented football team,\" Sarkisian said. \"What excited me today is that playmakers made plays and that's something that you try to recruit to. ... I think we're very good. And I think that we have a chance to do some really good things.\"",

            "date": "2024-04-20 18:19:00",
            "content": "FORT WORTH, Texas -- After being the runner-up on four different occasions and a perennial contender for the past several seasons, LSU won its first NCAA gymnastics title Saturday in front of 7,684 fans at Dickies Arena. The Tigers, who earned the highest score in Thursday's semifinals, led for the first two rotations Saturday but fell .037 points behind Utah ahead of the final event. But the team closed the deficit, and then some, on beam. Competing on her only event of the day, senior Sierra Ballard opened the rotation with a career-high 9.95 and, save for a mistake by graduate student Savannah Schoenherr, the Tigers continued to put up clutch routine after clutch routine for a record-setting total event score of 49.7625 -- the highest ever on beam in NCAA championship history. When Aleah Finnegan, the team's final performer, stuck her dismount, she hugged assistant coach Ashleigh Gnat and began to visibly shake and sob as she and her teammates -- jumping up and down several feet away -- seemed to realize what they had just achieved. Finnegan earned a 9.95 to give the team a final score of 198.225 and the victory over second-place California (197.8500). After struggling on vault, its last event, Utah fell to third place (197.8000). Florida finished in fourth (197.4375). LSU coach Jay Clark said he was \"speechless\" moments later during the ABC broadcast. Fifth-year senior Kiya Johnson, who returned this year after suffering a season-ending Achilles injury in 2023, later said she still couldn't fully put her emotions into words. \"I think the only words I said for the first five minutes after Aleah landed was, 'Oh my God, Oh my God,'\" Johnson told ESPN. The numerous Tigers fans in attendance chanted \"L-S-U\" and stood on their feet in appreciation as soon as Finnegan's routine ended, and they rarely stopped until after the formal presentation.\u00a0LSU became the eighth team in NCAA history to win the title. It already had been a surprising championship weekend as Oklahoma, the two-time defending champion and the overwhelming favorite to win it all, was eliminated Thursday during the semifinals. Clark said Oklahoma's absence in Saturday's final was felt by each team competing. \"Every team was out there fighting for their lives and all four teams, it could have gone any of four ways out there today,\" he said. \"I think as much as I feel for what happened to Oklahoma in the semifinals, I think it made for a championship that became so packed with emotion because every team out there believed they could do it, and it was just tremendous.\" At the meet's halfway mark, all four teams were within .288 points of each other. But it seemed to come down to a two-way race with one event to go as Utah surged atop the leaderboard following a high-scoring team performance on floor. However, the Red Rocks opened their final rotation on vault with two misses and were never able to recover. California, which was making its first appearance at the NCAA championship, ultimately leapfrogged Utah for the runner-up position thanks to three scores of 9.90 or better to end its day on bars. LSU had spent most of the season ranked in the top three nationally, and several of the Tigers had been open about their desire to win a national title. Senior Haleigh Bryant, who won the individual all-around title Thursday, said that goal had motivated the team all season. \"When you're having a hard day, it's the goal of bringing a national championship back to a program that's never won a national championship before that makes you excited and it gets you fired up,\" Bryant told ESPN last month. When asked how it felt to have achieved what they had set out to do since the beginning of the season, Bryant couldn't hide her excitement as she sat in front of a packed room of reporters while wearing her national championship gear. \"This is something I've dreamed about since I committed in the eighth grade to come to this program,\" she said. \"I've known Jay for so long, and I just wanted to be coached under him. And I'm just so excited to bring this national championship back to LSU, and I'm just thankful for all the opportunities I've gotten here, and I really don't have words. I'm just so happy. \"And yes, it lives up to every expectation and exceeds everything.\"",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- Aaron Judge struck out four times in four at-bats in the Yankees ' 2-0 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday, and he heard it from the home crowd. The former MVP was booed at Yankee Stadium after striking out on four pitches in the ninth inning with the game scoreless. The four-strikeout performance prolonged a slow start for Judge, who is batting .179 with a .682 on-base plus slugging percentage in 21 games this season. \"I've heard worse,\" Judge said, \"and I'd probably be doing the same thing in this situation.\" Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes , who tossed seven scoreless innings Saturday, called the fans' boos \"disappointing.\" \"I feel like he's done a lot for this team, a lot for this organization,\" Cortes said. \"He's going to come out [of this]. It's just a matter of time. This team is way too good to have a lot of games like today. He's going to come around. He's going to be Aaron Judge, obviously. It's just a matter of time.\" Judge, 32, acknowledged before spring training that the toe injury he suffered last season will require \"constant maintenance\" for the remainder of his career. He then missed time during spring training with an abdominal injury. But he insisted Saturday that he feels \"great\" physically. The slugger, two seasons removed from clubbing 62 home runs in an MVP campaign, has started every one of the Yankees' 21 games -- 16 games in center field and five as the designated hitter. Instead, he said his struggles stem from being too aggressive on balls out of the zone and missing pitches over the plate. Related Stories Caballero's tiebreaking double in the 10th lifts Rays past Yankees 2-0 Apr 20, 3:48 PM Juan Soto's 3-run homer in 5-run 7th inning lifts Yankees over Rays 5-3 Apr 19, 10:15 PM Judge hits the tiebreaking single in 9th as Yankees rally to avoid sweep with 6-4 win over Blue Jays Apr 17, 6:26 PM \"It's still early,\" Judge said. \"It's a long season. Just missing the pitch. Get a pitch in the zone, I got to capitalize on it because I don't get too many. And then I get hits. I think that's what it comes down to. Just don't miss your pitch when you get it and take your walks when you can, not getting anything.\" Judge's 27 strikeouts this season were tied for second in the American League after Saturday's loss. And yet his 17 walks were the second most in the majors. \"It's hitting, man,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \"We'll be here next year talking about a great player that's in a little funk. And we're in April. It happens all the time with greatness. Every year. And we'll scratch our heads, and then you look up in a few weeks and Aaron Judge is Aaron Judge.\" Without Judge producing at his usual clip, the Yankees are 11-1 when they score at least five runs this season. They have yet to tally double-digit runs in a game. For now, Juan Soto is serving as the club's offensive engine, delighting fans with his exploits and swagger in his first month with the team. On Friday, Soto, hitting in front of Judge in the lineup, delivered a back-breaking three-run home run to ignite a frenzy in a win in The Bronx. A day later, Judge was hearing the other end in a loss. \"It's New York. Obviously, they expect a lot from us,\" Cortes said. \"We expect a lot from each other in this clubhouse. So we just want to go out there and do the best we can every time. It's not like we're not trying to score runs or we're not trying to pitch well. So, like I said, it's just a matter of time for us.\"",

            "content": "Former Indiana State star Robbie Avila , one of the biggest breakout players of the 2023-24 season, is following coach Josh Schertz and transferring to Saint Louis, he announced on Saturday. Avila entered the transfer portal earlier this month with a \"Do Not Contact\" classification, generally an indication a player has made up his mind on where he's attending. \"I will be committing to the Saint Louis University,\" Avila told \"The Field of 68\" podcast. \"I will be going there to play under Josh Schertz again. I trusted his path for me the last two years and trust what he has planned for me these next few years. I'm excited to get over there and do the same thing we did at Indiana State, win some games.\" A 6-foot-10 center from Oak Forest, Illinois, Avila grew into something resembling a cult hero as the focal point of Indiana State's 32-win campaign. His goggles and unique skill set helped him earn nicknames such as \"Cream Abdul-Jabbar,\" \"Larry Nerd, \"Larry Blurred\" and \"Steph Blurry.\" Avila averaged 17.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists while shooting 39.4% from 3-point range. He earned first-team All-Missouri Valley honors and was the fulcrum for one of the nation's most efficient offenses. The Sycamores were No. 1 nationally in effective field goal percentage, No. 1 in 2-point percentage and No. 11 in 3-point percentage. They fell short of making the NCAA tournament, but went on a run to the NIT championship game before losing to Seton Hall. In the days that followed, Schertz would finalize a deal to become the next head coach at Saint Louis, while all five starters -- Avila, Ryan Conwell , Isaiah Swope , Julian Larry and Jayson Kent -- entered the transfer portal. Avila is the only one so far to follow Schertz to Saint Louis, as Conwell committed to Xavier, and Larry and Kent are headed to Texas.",

            "content": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola lashed out at the FA Cup schedule after his side reached the final by beating Chelsea 1-0 on Saturday, three days after their treble bid was ended by defeat on penalties by Real Madrid in the Champions League. A late goal by Bernardo Silva got holders City over the line, although they rode their luck in a 1-0 win over Chelsea , who were punished for not taking the numerous chances they created. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) City, who were without fatigued striker\u00a0Erling Haaland, lacked their usual zip, and despite reaching another final, Guardiola was clearly agitated at his side's lack of recovery time after the heartache of Wednesday's Champions League exit. \"It's unacceptable to let us play today,\" Guardiola told the BBC. \"It's impossible, for the health of the players. It's not normal. It's unacceptable -- 120 minutes, the emotions of Madrid, the way we lose, honestly. \"I know this country is special [with the FA Cup], but it's for the health of the players. I don't understand how we survived today.\" The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss also praised the mentality of his players for finding a way to win. \"What they did today is one of the greatest things I have ever seen from a group of players after 120 minutes of football on Wednesday,\" he said in a news conference.

It's common sense. I'm not asking for something special or privilege.\" Guardiola's stance was supported by Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta. Arsenal, who also lost in the Champions League in midweek, beat Wolves 2-0 later on Saturday to return to the top of the Premier League, a point above City but having played a game more. \"It's not about us, Pep or myself, it's about the well-being of the players,\" Arteta, Guardiola's former assistant at Man City said in a news conference. \"When you compete in European competition, every team has to compete in the same way. \"You cannot have a team that hasn't played for seven days, or three days before, and has more recovery time and then you have to play in the Premier League and the FA Cup. It is not right. If you look in any angle, it's not right. \"If you want to protect, let's talk about the players and the protagonists. Let's protect the players and do everything we can to give them the maximum time to help them recover and perform and do the show that they do every week.\" The exit to Madrid ended City's hopes of a second straight treble, but Silva's goal ensured they are still very much on course to secure the Premier League/FA Cup double. \"We're happy with another final and another chance to win a trophy,\" said Silva, who made amends for his miss in the penalty shootout. \"We've done it throughout the years many times. The way this team reacts to disappointments and defeats is always in the best way. Today again the team showed a lot of character.\" Information from ESPN's James Olley and Reuters contributed to this report.",

All-Star Paul George , who will have to shoulder more of the load if Leonard is unable to play, said the Clippers have been unlucky with health in the postseason.

Alvarez, 22, appeared to sustain the injury in the second inning of the Mets' 9-4 victory against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday. While running the bases, he stumbled while going around first, then planted his left hand on the ground to stabilize himself before continuing to second base. Manager Carlos Mendoza said the team still was waiting for results of an MRI performed late Friday night \"but we know for sure it's going to more than 10 days.\" \"You hate to see it,\" Mendoza said. \"We don't know how long he's going to be out for but we know how much energy he brings and the way he was playing.

He'll get through it. He's a strong kid. He's very positive. He will be fine.\" In a corresponding move, the Mets selected catcher Tomas Nido from Triple-A Syracuse and designated left-hander Kolton Ingram for assignment. In 16 games this season, Alvarez is batting .236 with a home run and eight RBIs. He assumed the starter role as a rookie last season, batting .209 with 25 homers and 63 RBIs in 123 games. Nido, 30, is hitting .345 with a home run and two RBIs in nine games at Syracuse. He has spent parts of the past seven seasons with the Mets and has a career average of .213 in 274 games. Ingram, a 27-year-old reliever, was 1-0 with a 7.20 in five innings stretched over four games at Syracuse.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 44 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:40 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.7% higher. Zions Bancorp. climbed after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts called it a solid showing, and its stock rose 2.7% to recover some of the sharp slide they took last year on worries surrounding the strength of the larger regional banking industry.

That includes several companies that have come to be known as part of the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d beyond Tesla. This handful of companies was responsible for the majority of the S & P 500\u2019s big gain last year, raising the bar of expectations for them to meet to justify their stock prices. Analysts believe those seven stocks, as a group, saw growth in their earnings per share slow to 39% last quarter from 63% at the end of last year, according to strategists at Bank of America. This past quarter may also have marked the trough for earnings declines among the other 493 companies in the index. The narrowing growth difference between them and the Magnificent Seven should close by the end of the year, strategists Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian said in a BofA Global Research Report. Verizon Communications helped kick off this week's reports by disclosing a drop in profit that wasn't quite as bad as analysts expected.

Verizon's stock swung from an early gain to a loss of 1.2% after it reported weaker revenue for the first quarter than expected and kept its forecast for full-year profit the same.

            "date": "2024-04-16 12:25:00",
            "content": "Shares of Truth Social soared after the company\u2019s market debut last month -- but the stock price has plummeted since then. After vaulting from an initial offering price of about $50 to a peak of nearly $80 in late March, the share price has dropped a staggering 68%. In early trading on Tuesday, the price stood at about $25. The sharp decline traces primarily to the company\u2019s status as a so-called meme stock, which appeals to investors on the basis of ideology rather than financial outlook, experts told ABC News. Since Truth Social suffers continued losses and lacks a path to profitability, the stock risks selloffs on even mildly negative news, they said. \u201cThe political hope is meeting a financial reality,\u201d Tyler Richey, an analyst at Sevens Report Research, told ABC News. Truth Social did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. The stock performance holds significant financial implications for former President Donald Trump, whose 60% stake in the company could ultimately deliver a multi-billion dollar windfall. Truth Social shares make up a large portion of Trump\u2019s overall net worth, according to Fortune . During its initial days on the market, the stock rallied . The price climbed 16% on the company\u2019s first day of listing and another 14% on its second. That growth granted Truth Social a valuation of more than $8 billion, even though the company has yet to turn a profit and generates quarterly revenue of barely $1 million. \u201cThe valuation is just astronomical,\u201d Richey said. \u201cSo it\u2019s coming back to Earth.\u201d Truth Social, listed as ticker DJT, remains far smaller and less financially robust than its rivals in the crowded social media sector. Research firm SimilarWeb estimates the company drew 5 million website visitors in February, which puts it well below the roughly 2 billion monthly active users reported by Instagram. TikTok boasts at least 1 billion monthly active users, the company said in 2021. Truth Social generated roughly $3 million over the first nine months of 2023, government filings show. Meanwhile, the company reported $49 million in net losses over that period. By comparison, Instagram-parent Meta delivered nearly $135 billion in revenue last year, company earnings revealed . \u201cTruth Social is not attracting and holding users and it\u2019s not attracting significant advertising revenue,\u201d Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News. \u201cIts current business model is a colossal failure.\u201d The download screen for Truth Social app is seen on a laptop computer, March 20, 2024, in New York. John Minchillo/AP, FILE The absence of financial underpinning leaves the stock vulnerable to major declines even in response to mildly negative or routine news, experts said.

Apr 18, 8:55 PM Social media searches play central role at jury selection for Trump's first criminal trial Apr 18, 12:11 AM On Monday, the company released a government filing meant to formally establish millions of shares owned by Donald Trump and other investors. Investors holding shares in the pre-merger company that took Truth Social public could eventually convert those holdings into shares of Truth Social, the filing said. The routine filing did not increase the number of outstanding shares but it still raised alarm among some investors for the potential to do so, Ritter said. \u201cThis was going to happen sooner or later,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cIn that regard, it wasn\u2019t really news.\u201d The filing appeared to send the stock price tumbling. Shares of Truth Social fell 18% on Monday. When traders buy into a stock for non-financial reasons, moments of risk can turn into a collapse, in part because opportunistic traders abandon the stock on the way down, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s a domino effect,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cSelling led to more selling.\u201d The stock difficulty has coincided with financial challenges for Trump. Earlier this month, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee posted a $175 million bond in a New York civil fraud case. Trump can\u2019t sell or leverage his stake in Truth Social for at least six months due to a lockup provision intended to prevent a rapid selloff that could shake investor confidence. Supporters of Trump could seek to reverse the company\u2019s declining stock price, Richey said. \u201cYou may have some die-hard supporters come in and support the stock,\u201d Richey said, noting that such a move could elicit a response from skeptics of Trump or the company. \u201cIn this political environment, there\u2019s just as many people that would bet against the stock as would be for it,\u201d Richey said.",

            "date": "2024-04-12 13:41:00",
            "content": "Shoppers are flocking to Costco for gold bars but they're hardly the only ones scooping up the precious metal. Investors drove gold prices to a record high on Friday, the latest surge in a 17% rally so far this year. Over that period, bullion prices have climbed more than twice as fast as the S &P 500 , the index that most people's 401(k)'s track. The price gains stem from a wider trend of investors seeking out high-return assets in anticipation of interest rate cuts expected later this year, some experts told ABC News. A so-called momentum trade has also pushed prices higher, they added, since investors see the price of gold swell and want to share in the gains. MORE: Costco makes hundreds of millions on 24-karat gold bar sales \"We're seeing a situation where people are actually increasing their risk exposure,\" Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke's Fuqua School of Business who studies commodity prices, told ABC News, noting that the typical price volatility of gold resembles that of the S &P 500. \"You see things like the S &P 500 going up and bitcoin going up,\" Harvey added. \"Gold is part of that.\" Costco has generated an estimated $100 million to $200 million per month in gold bar sales, Wells Fargo said in a recent equity research note. While the price is not disclosed online to nonmembers, the product typically sells for nearly 2% above the spot price, which as of time of publication stood at $2,430 per ounce. The buying spree has also taken hold at central banks, UBS said in a report last week, citing some central banks' desire to move away from U.S. dollars and hedge against inflation risks. In January and February, central banks purchased about 64 metric tons of gold and China imported 132 metric tons from Switzerland, a gold-refinery stalwart, UBS said. Hedge funds and other institutional investors have also bought into the gold craze in an effort to capitalize on the commodity's blistering rise, Campbell said. \"That institutional pressure is pushing the price of gold up,\" he added. Gold prices have surged despite low activity in a key instrument for everyday investors: ETFs. An ETF amounts to a bucket of securities that gives investors a way to bet that an underlying asset will increase in price without purchasing that asset. An ETF for gold, in turn, allows individuals to put money on the price movement of the precious metal rather than buy, lug and store the physical item. Over the last 10 months, however, gold ETFs have incurred a net outflow of funds, meaning that on the whole the ETFs are losing investment rather than gaining it, Harvey said. That trend, he added, suggests retail investors are not a major cause of the price increase. Shoppers outside a Costco store in Bayonne, NJ, Dec. 9, 2023. Angus Mordant/Bloomberg via Getty Images Gold is also widely viewed as a hedge against geopolitical unrest because the millennia-old store of value is perceived as an investment that could outlive calamity. World Gold Council, a United Kingdom-based trade association for the gold industry, said global disruption could drive up prices this year, according to a January report . MORE: Hot inflation likely to delay interest rate cuts. Here's what to expect \"In addition to monetary policy, geopolitical uncertainty is often a key driver of gold demand and in 2024 we expect this to have a pronounced impact on the market,\" the World Gold Council report said. For his part, Harvey cast doubt on the role of geopolitics in the price surge, since the onset of the rally did not coincide with the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war in October. Investors aiming to put money in gold can do it in a variety of ways. In addition to purchasing the gold bars on offer at some stores like Costco, investors can put funds into a variety of gold ETFs or buy shares in gold mining companies. Individuals can also invest in gold futures, contracts to buy or sell gold on an agreed-upon date, which essentially amount to a bet on the movement of the price. Investors should beware, however, Harvey said, noting that bullion typically generates modest returns over the period following an all-time high. UBS expects the price of gold to tick up to $2,500 by the end of the year, according to its report last week. \"Investing at an all-time high is very risky,\" Harvey said.

            "title": "A ban on single-use plastics takes effect in Hong Kong in a bid to reduce pollution",
            "date": "2024-04-22 06:19:00",
            "content": "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong has long been a major producer and consumer of great food , and a great amount of plastic and Styrofoam to go with it. That\u2019s going to change as new legislation aiming to stop the sale and distribution of Styrofoam products and single-use plastic cutlery went into effect on Monday. Under the new law, single-use cutlery such as forks, spoons, straws and plates cannot be sold or distributed for both dine-in and takeaway customers. However, plastic food containers and cups can still be given out for takeaways. The regulation of disposable plastic tableware and other plastic products in Hong Kong aims to reduce their use at the source to cut down on pollution, Hong Kong\u2019s Environmental Protection Department said in an emailed response to The Associated Press. Restaurants were given a six-month grace period. A second phase of the ban, expected next year, will ban all single-use plastics including containers for both dine-in and takeaway. Many restaurants have already begun implementing the new measure. Kuen Fat Kitchen is a typical lunch stop for many people in Hong Kong. Even before the new law was introduced, it had already started to reduce the use of Styrofoam boxes. Owner Kitty Chan said the changes will mean higher costs. \u201cFor a single-use cutlery set, you might think it\u2019s just a small change, but switching the plastic spoon to a paper spoon doubles the cost for us. So, it\u2019s not so friendly to the business of the food and beverage industry,\u201d Chan added. Customers at Kuen Fat Kitchen have mixed feelings. Some don\u2019t want to face extra hassle when going out to eat if they are asked to bring their own containers and utensils. \u201cWhen I\u2019m at work, I only have an hour for lunch, and I need to eat efficiently. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s convenient for me to bring my own cutlery and do the washing up afterwards. It\u2019s not convenient and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said customer Darren Seng. Others recognized the environment al impacts of their dining-out habits. \u201cI think it's better for the environment,\u201d said resident Thomson Choi. Single-use plastic cutlery is the second-largest source of plastic waste after single-use plastic bags in Hong Kong, according to Greenpeace. Many businesses are changing to alternative plastics made of natural resources to comply with new rules, instead of improving their packaging, the organization added. Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam hopes that the new law will discourage the throwaway culture and promote reusables, instead of \u201cgreener\u201d disposables. \u201cAny kind of plastic ban policy should aim to influence the public to stay away from plastic. We should move on, and have a new approach,\u201d said Tam. \u201cBut we would like to remind the government that it should devote more resources to promote reusable instead of disposable. This is the way to solve the root of the problem.\u201d According to the latest figures by Hong Kong's government in 2022, the city disposed 11,128 tons of solid waste per day, among which plastics contributed 2,369 tons. Hong Kong is reliant on the city\u2019s three landfills to handle its waste, but they are expected to be filled up by around 2026, according to the government. The city plans to implement municipal solid waste charging from Aug. 1, but the logistics have yet to be worked out. It would compel individual homes, restaurants, and all businesses to pay for trash they throw away.",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cCivil War,\u201d Alex Garland\u2019s ominous American dystopia, remained the top film in theaters in its second week of release, according to studio estimates Sunday. The A24 election -year gamble, the indie studio\u2019s biggest budgeted film yet, took in $11.1 million in ticket sales at 3,929 theaters over the weekend. The $50 million film, set in a near-future U.S. in which Texas and California have joined in rebellion against a fascist president, has grossed $44.9 million in two weeks. Its provocative premise \u2013 and A24\u2019s marketing, which included images of U.S. cities ravaged by war \u2013 helped keep \u201cCivil War\u201d top of mind for moviegoers. But it was a painfully slow weekend in theaters \u2013 the kind sure to add to concern over what\u2019s thus far been a down year for Hollywood at the box office. Year-to-date ticket sales are down almost 20% compared to last year, according to Comscore. Going into the weekend, Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cAbigail,\u201d a critically acclaimed R-rated horror film about the daughter of Dracula, had been expected to lead ticket sales. It came in second with $10.2 million in 3,384 theaters. That was still a fair result for a film that cost a modest $28 million to make. \u201cAbigail,\u201d which remakes the 1936 monster film \u201cDracula\u2019s Daughter,\u201d is about a 12-year-old girl taken by kidnappers who soon realize they\u2019ve made a poor choice of hostage. It\u2019s directed by the duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett whose production company goes by the name Radio Silence. More concerning was the overall tepid response for a handful of new wide releases \u2013 and the likelihood that there will be more similar weekends throughout 2024. Last year\u2019s actors and writers' strikes, which had a prolonged effect on the movie pipeline, exacerbated holes in Hollywood\u2019s release schedule. Horror films, in recent years among the most reliable cash cows in theaters, also haven\u2019t thus far been doing the automatic business they previous did. According to David A. Gross, who runs the consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, horror releases accounted for $2 billion in worldwide sales in 2023. Guy Ritchie\u2019s \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\u201d debuted with $9 million in 2,845 theaters. In the based-on-a-true-story Lionsgate release, which reportedly cost $60 million to produce, Henry Cavill leads a World War II mission off the coast of West Africa. Though Ritchie has been behind numerous box-office hits, including the live-action \u201cAladdin\u201d and a pair of Sherlock Holmes films, his recent movies have struggled to find big audiences. The Lionsgate spy comedy \u201cOperation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre\u201d grossed $48 million against a $50 million budget, while MGM\u2019s \u201cThe Covenant,\u201d also released last year, made $21 million while costing $55 million to make. A bright sign for \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\u201d: audiences liked it. The film earned an A-minus CinemaScore. The anime \u201cSpy x Family Code: White,\u201d from Sony\u2019s Crunchyroll, also struggled to stand out with audiences. Though the adaptation of the Tatsuya Endo manga TV series \u201cSpy x Family\u201d has already been a hit with international moviegoers, it debuted below expectations with $4.9 million in 2,009 U.S. theaters. The mightiest film globally, though, continues to be \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\u201d The Warner Bros. monster movie has for the past month led worldwide ticket sales. It added another $9.5 million domestically and $21.6 million internationally to bring its four-week global total to $485.2 million. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. \u201cCivil War,\u201d $11.1 million. 2. \u201cAbigail,\u201d $10.2 million. 3. \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire,\u201d $9.5 million. 4. \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,\u201d $9 million. 5. \u201cSpy x Family Code: White,\u201d $4.9 million. 6. \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\" $4.6 million. 7. \u201cGhostbusters: Frozen Empire,\u201d $4.4 million. 8. \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d $2.9 million. 9. \u201cMonkey Man,\u201d $2.2 million. 10. \u201cThe First Omen,\u201d $1.7 million.",

            "content": "A container ship crash that partially collapsed Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge Tuesday has destroyed a key artery for vehicle traffic in the city and closed the Port of Baltimore. Six people remain unaccounted for as the search continues at the site of the bridge collapse, Coast Guard officials said at a Tuesday-morning news conference. Two people were rescued, including one who was hospitalized and later discharged, officials said. The Port of Baltimore, the nation's 17th-largest in annual total tonnage of cargo as of 2021, handles more cars and trucks than any other in the U.S, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said in a statement last month. The Key Bridge, meanwhile, carried more than 30,000 vehicles each day. Baltimore Harbor is expected to be closed for at least a few days amid ongoing rescue and cleanup efforts, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, told ABC News. The bridge collapse will not meaningfully impact the U.S. economy, nor will it push Baltimore into a recession, Zandi added, though he said the incident could still cause significant economic ramifications. MORE: Baltimore Key Bridge collapse live updates: At least 6 unaccounted for, no evidence of terrorism The Port of Baltimore set a record last year for the amount of foreign cargo handled at its point of entry, Gov. Moore said. In all, the port handled 52.3 tons, or $80 billion worth, of foreign cargo, making it the ninth-busiest port in the country last year for such goods. \"The Port of Baltimore is a key component in Maryland's transportation network,\" Maryland Department of Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said in a statement last month. The port leads all U.S. peers in the handling of autos, heavy farm and construction machinery, imported sugar and imported gypsum, Moore said. A container ship as it rests against wreckage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024, as seen from Dundalk, Md. Matt Rourke/AP The Port of Baltimore handled around 850,000 cars and light trucks in 2023, putting its annual amount above that of any other U.S. port for the past 13 years, according to the Maryland Port Administration. The port closure could result in \"some short-term impacts in the auto market,\" Zandi said, noting that the outcome will depend on the duration of the blockage and the availability of alternative transportation routes. Roughly 15,000 jobs depend directly on the port, while nearly 140,000 jobs are linked to its activities, Moore said in a statement last month. MORE: What to know about the massive ship that crashed into the Baltimore bridge Norwegian Cruise Line operates winter and summer trips through the port, Moore said. In February, the company was set to return later this year. On top of the interruption of port activity, the collapse of the Key Bridge removes a major passageway for vehicles, especially commercial ones, Zandi said. Large trucks traveling through Baltimore rely on the Key Bridge, since they're prohibited from using the Harbor Tunnel, an alternative route. Due to the bridge collapse, Zandi added, such trucks will need to travel through the city of Baltimore or take a significant detour, causing notable delays. Taken together, the supply disruption from the port closure and bridge collapse could put slight upward pressure on U.S. prices, Zandi said.

As demand surges for the power-intensive complexes, which typically span 100,000 square feet, the increased energy usage could jeopardize the fight to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change , experts told ABC News. \"The growth trend is super-fast,\" Fengqi You, an energy engineering professor at Cornell University, told ABC News. \"This is something I'm concerned about.\" In 2022, roughly 2,700 data centers in the U.S. accounted for over 4% of the nation's electricity use, according to an International Energy Agency report released in January. By 2026, that share of electricity use is expected to reach 6%. MORE: How the UN Plastics Treaty aims to tackle the pollution crisis The proportion of U.S. electricity use for data centers is expected to continue to climb in the ensuing years, the report said, citing anticipated broader adoption of AI and crypto. By 2026, the AI industry alone is expected to consume at least ten times its energy demand from just three years prior, the IEA report found. Nvidia, a California-based firm that sells the majority of computer chips behind the AI boom, exemplifies this growth. Over three months ending in January, the company's revenue surged 265% compared to the same period a year prior, an earnings report showed. \"If Nvidia keeps growing in the way they're hoping they'll grow and keeps selling in the way they're planning to, that's a fairly large increase in energy usage,\" Arman Shehabi, a staff scientist in energy technologies at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told ABC News. In response to ABC News' request for comment, a Nvidia spokesperson said the company's products would reduce energy use in data centers, since Nvidia uses accelerated computing enabled by specialized hardware called a graphics processing unit, or GPU. \u201cReplacing conventional servers with GPU-accelerated systems will reduce, not increase, energy use in datacenters,\" the spokesperson said. \"For example, a single GPU-accelerated server can replace hundreds of conventional servers to accomplish the same workload. And our GPUs enable AI-enhanced systems that will be more energy efficient across all industries, including transportation, manufacturing, logistics, and energy, among others.\u201d In its fiscal year 2023 annual corporate responsibility report , the company highlighted what they said were AI-driven tools helping to address climate change, including carbon reduction and management.

The primary strain on data centers imposed by crypto is the result of crypto mining, which is the computing process used to complete transactions and generate new coins. The IAD71 Amazon Web Services data center in Ashburn, Virginia, March 27, 2024. Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images In addition, the shift to remote work caused as much as a 35% spike in demand for data-center usage during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tevfik Kosar, professor of computer science and engineering at the University at Buffalo, told ABC News. While the increased demand ebbed as many employees returned to work, the persistence of hybrid work arrangements has elevated such data-center demand above pre-pandemic levels, he added. \"That capacity increase didn't really go back to normal,\" Kosar said. In all, the electric power sector accounted for nearly a quarter of U.S. carbon emissions in 2022, making it the second-largest industry emitter behind transportation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says on its website. More than half of the nation's electricity came from fossil-fuel sources, including coal and natural gas, the EPA adds. The information technology sector \u2013 of which data centers make up a key part \u2013 accounts for about 3% of global carbon emissions, which matches the share of worldwide emissions produced by the aviation industry, Kosar said. \"That is not so small,\" he noted.

Government policy, however, could allow the U.K. to avert job losses and harness AI for a breakneck economic surge, according to the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research, the think tank that authored the report. \u201cThe world of knowledge work will be transformed by generative AI,\u201d the report said, referring to a type of AI that can create content, such as text or images. \u201cWe need to start preparing for this now.\u201d MORE: Is AI coming for your job? ChatGPT renews fears Researchers analyzed 22,000 tasks carried out by workers across the U.K. economy, finding that 11% are currently exposed to the threat of displacement by AI, the study said. The jobs at greatest risk include entry-level, part-time and administrative roles -- a set of positions disproportionately held by women, the study added. The report describes a soon-to-begin phase of AI adoption during which some of these \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d jobs will be replaced by the technology. The overall workforce impact over the period could be limited, the study said, but some roles will experience massive effects, such as the elimination of one-third of administrative jobs. A second phase could bring much deeper integration of AI that will threaten up to 59% of tasks, the report said. If companies allow AI to access proprietary information and execute key tasks, the study said, the resulting disruption may slash a wider swathe of jobs, including a larger share of high-paying positions. While offering up potential outcomes, the study acknowledged that a wide range of job-displacement scenarios remains possible, including the potential for job losses to be avoided entirely. Experts who spoke to ABC News last year noted the absence of job losses during a surge of AI adoption over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Artificial intelligence could displace roughly 15% of workers, or 400 million people, worldwide between 2016 and 2030, according to a McKinsey study released in 2018. In a scenario of wide AI adoption, the share of jobs displaced could rise to as much as 30%, the firm found.

A combination of government incentives and public-private partnerships could help achieve the measure. In its most optimistic potential scenario, the report outlines a future of AI adoption in which no jobs are lost and gross domestic product increases by 13%. \u201cThere is no one predetermined path for how AI implementation will play out,\u201d the report's authors said.",

The workers voted 2,628 to 985 for union representation, according to a spokesperson for the National Labor Relations Board. \"There were seven challenged ballots that won\u2019t be counted, because they aren\u2019t determinative to the outcome of the election. There were three void ballots. The total number of eligible voters was 4,326,\" according to a statement from the NLRB. The employer will begin \"bargaining in good faith\" with the union, with parties having five days to file objections to the election. The vote to unionize has the potential to supercharge organizing in the nation's auto sector and demonstrate the strength of a resurgent labor movement through a victory in the South, a region typically resistant to unions. Workers began casting ballots this week in the most significant test for the UAW since a strike last fall against the Big 3 U.S. carmakers that delivered substantial gains and a burst of interest from employees at non-union firms. \"Workers in America are fed up with being left behind and unions are the path to dignity on and off the job,\" UAW president Shawn Fain said in February in a post on X , after having met with workers at the Volkswagen facility. MORE: Why the UAW vote at Volkswagen is significant for workers across US The labor agreements at the Big 3 last year prompted some non-union competitors to offer pay increases and other benefits, putting their employees in closer alignment with UAW members. Honda, Nissan and Tesla are among the companies that raised wages for U.S. employees after the UAW deal. The breakthrough also triggered a wave of UAW organizing, the union says. Over 10,000 non-union auto workers have signed cards in support of the UAW in recent months and organizing campaigns have broken out at more than two dozen facilities, the union said in a statement last month. The election at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga offered a difficult test, even as the union appears poised for growth. The UAW suffered narrow defeats in two elections at the facility over the past decade. Governors of six southern states, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, issued a joint statement this week criticizing the UAW and voicing general opposition toward unions. \"As Governors, we have a responsibility to our constituents to speak up when we see special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by,\" they wrote .

More than 500,000 workers went out on strike nationwide in 2023, more than doubling the figure recorded a year earlier, according to Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations . The uptick in activity, however, failed to translate into union membership gains. Only 10% of U.S. workers belonged to unions last year, little changed from the year prior, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed. The election in Chattanooga will test whether the headline-grabbing labor strikes can translate into a resurgence of union growth, said Stephen Silvia, a professor at American University and the author of \"The UAW's Southern Gamble.\" \"Historically, unionization has proceeded in waves,\" Silvia said. \"Is this a wave? That's what we'll see.\"",

Under the initial divestiture plan, announced in September, C & S had planned to purchase 413 stores for $1.9 billion. It\u2019s unclear if the new plan will satisfy regulators. In February, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the $24.6 billion merger between the grocery giants, saying the lack of competition would lead to higher grocery prices and lower wages for workers. The FTC also said the initial plan to divest 413 stores to C & S was \u201cinadequate\u201d and would give C & S a hodgepodge of unconnected stores and brands, leaving it ill-equipped to compete with a combined Kroger and Albertsons. Under the updated plan, Kroger would sell its Haggen banner to C & S. C & S would also license the Albertsons banner in California and Wyoming and the Safeway banner in Arizona and Colorado. C & S would also get access to some private-label brands in the stores.

            "date": "2024-04-22 09:36:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to take up a Biden administration appeal over the regulation of difficult-to-trace ghost guns that had been struck down by lower courts. The justices by a 5-4 vote had previously intervened to keep the regulation in effect during the legal fight. Ghost guns, which lack serial numbers, have been turning up at crime scenes with increasing regularity. The regulation, which took effect in 2022, changed the definition of a firearm under federal law to include unfinished parts, like the frame of a handgun or the receiver of a long gun, so they can be tracked more easily. Those parts must be licensed and include serial numbers. Manufacturers must also run background checks before a sale, as they do with other commercially made firearms. The requirement applies regardless of how the firearm was made, meaning it includes ghost guns made from individual parts or kits or by 3D printers. The rule does not prohibit people from buying a kit or any type of firearm. The Justice Department had told the court that local law enforcement agencies seized more than 19,000 ghost guns at crime scenes in 2021, a more than tenfold increase in just five years. U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor, in Fort Worth, Texas, struck down the rule last year, concluding that it exceeded the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 authority. O\u2019Connor wrote that the definition of a firearm in federal law does not cover all the parts of a gun. Congress could change the law, he wrote. A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals made up of three appointees of then-President Donald Trump largely upheld O'Connor's ruling. The Supreme Court allowed the regulation to remain in effect while the lawsuit continues. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court\u2019s three liberal members to form the majority. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas would have kept the regulation on hold during the appeals process. Barrett, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were appointed by Trump.

            "date": "2024-04-22 09:19:00",
            "content": "Lana Vierra misses the swing set at her Lahaina home, which was reduced to ashes in the wildfires that swept through her community last summer. \u201cMultiple generations went through there playing in my front yard,\" she said. \"Just with the animals and the turtles and the deer and goats that we once had in that little tiny yard.\u201d A grandmother of four and a mother of five, Vierra had lived in the home on a corner lot since 1991. She and ten family members, including a baby less than one year old, were displaced in the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. In the weeks that followed, she and her adult children applied for and received many different kinds of assistance, including from the People's Fund of Maui, an initiative set up by Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne Johnson. All of them, except one adult son, have since received six monthly payments of $1,200 directly in their bank accounts from the People's Fund. Vierra credits the payments with helping them stay current on their mortgage, which they had to pay even though the house was destroyed. When she learned she would receive direct payments, she said, \u201cThat was in the back of my head that if I had to use it, I had it. And it would probably save my house.\u201d When Winfrey and Johnson launched the People's Fund for Maui, which benefitted people who lost their homes in the wildfires, they committed $10 million and asked others to join them. At the time, the request was met with some criticism, given especially Winfrey's wealth and extensive estate in Maui. In the end, the Entertainment Industry Foundation, a longtime nonprofit that helps celebrities administer charitable work and that managed the distribution of the funds, said it raised almost $60 million. That money was dispersed between September and February to some 8,100 adults \u2014 a significant portion of the 12,000 people the state of Hawaii estimates were displaced. The foundation wouldn't say exactly how much Winfrey and Johnson gave in total, but a list of other contributors indicates the bulk came from them. EIF said more than 20,000 individuals and companies donated to the fund. In September, Winfrey posted a video on social media thanking supporters, saying, \u201cYour generosity, I guarantee you, is going to touch the lives of many families.\u201d Over many years, the disaster response community has grown to trust direct cash transfers like these as a very useful tool, said Shannon Doocy, a professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. Despite initial fears of misuse, she said, research has shown cash transfers overwhelmingly benefit the intended recipients who spend it on essentials like housing and food. \u201cGenerally, there\u2019s the idea that cash provides dignity and choice, that it\u2019s a more cost effective use of assistance, \u201d said Doocy. \u201cBecause not every household has the exact same needs, and households know their needs better than outside organizations.\u201d Many nonprofits and government programs now use direct cash transfers, including others in Maui, following disasters. Vierra's family has tried to save all the money they've received, including from a GoFundMe that family members set up, direct gifts strangers sent to her daughter\u2019s Venmo account and a gift from a fundraiser Fox News host Will Cain started. They will need that money \u2014 and more \u2014 to rebuild, though those plans are still very distant. She said they are extremely grateful to everyone who donated and for the mutual aid efforts that were set up immediately after the fires. Those local efforts were how most people received assistance in the first weeks after the fire, said Maui-based attorney Lance Collins, who is representing some survivors. \u201cPeople felt that, in general, there was a tremendous outpouring of generosity by individuals and community groups and I think that Oprah and The Rock fell into that category,\u201d he said. Most of Vierra's family has been staying in hotels, an initial boon to the disaster response in a community where demand for housing was already extremely high before 12,000 people lost their homes in the fires. However, uncertainty and issues with mental health have been growing among those staying in hotels, according to nonprofits working with them, said Lauren Nahme, senior vice president of the Maui Recovery Effort at the Hawai\u2018i Community Foundation. In January, state and county governments along with the foundation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced a $500 million commitment to build 3,000 housing units that would offer displaced people shelter for at least 18 months. The foundation committed $50 million to the effort, its single largest grant from its Maui Strong fund, which it opened immediately after the wildfires. In total, the fund raised $189 million from more than 250,000 people all over the world. The foundation followed a disaster response plan it had crafted in 2019, in anticipation of a possible catastrophic event. It has paid out $89 million in grants so far, purposefully directing the majority of its support toward recovery and stabilization efforts which will extend over months and years. This is the work that direct cash transfers won't address, including providing services, strengthening social support systems and rebuilding with the next potential disaster in mind. Kaimana Brummel, who leads fundraising at a Seabury Hall, a private school in Maui, was invited to offer some thoughts about the design of the People\u2019s Fund of Maui. She said she suggested that the fund make every adult who was displaced eligible for a direct cash transfer instead of just every household. Brummel said what she saw of Winfrey and Johnson\u2019s approach made her feel that they were approaching this gift with the spirit of a Hawaiian word, \u201c\u2018kahiau.\u2019 And it means to give lavishly, with no expectation of getting anything in return.\u201d Barry Probst, a therapist whose family has lived on Lahaina for four generations, said the absolute best case scenario is that he and his wife would rebuild and move into a new home in 2026. They are lucky to stay in a second bedroom of a condo owned by good friends, who spend half the year in Hawaii. He's used the funds he received from the People's Fund of Maui to twice pay for repairing his car and also to complete an intensive training on trauma treatment he hopes to use to help others in the community. \u201cFor the rest of the world, August 8th was an event that happened and they go on with the rest of their lives and rightfully so,\u201d said Probst. \u201cBut for us that were directly impacted and live here, it\u2019s something that we have to navigate on a daily basis.\u201d ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

            "date": "2024-04-22 09:07:00",
            "content": "A tipline set up 26 years ago to combat online child exploitation has not lived up to its potential and needs technological and other improvements to help law enforcement go after abusers and rescue victims, a new report from the Stanford Internet Observatory has found. The fixes to what the researchers describe as an \u201cenormously valuable\u201d service must also come urgently as new artificial intelligence technology threatens to worsen its problems. \u201cAlmost certainly in the years to come, the CyberTipline will just be flooded with highly realistic-looking AI content, which is going to make it even harder for law enforcement to identify real children who need to be rescued,\u201d said researcher Shelby Grossman, an author of the report. The service was established by Congress as the main line of defense for children who are exploited online. By law, tech companies must report any child sexual abuse material they find on their platforms to the system, which is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. After it receives the reports, NCMEC attempts to find the people who sent or received the material \u2014 as well as the victims, if possible. These reports are then sent to law enforcement. While the sheer amount of CyberTipline reports is overwhelming law enforcement, researchers say volume is just one of several problems core to the system. For instance, many of the reports sent by tech companies \u2014 like Google, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 lack important details, such as enough information about an offender's identity, the report said. This makes it hard for law enforcement to know which reports to prioritize. \u201cThere are significant issues with the entire system right now and those cracks are going to become chasms in a world in which AI is generating brand-new CSAM,\u201d said Alex Stamos, using the initials for child sexual abuse materials. Stamos is a Stanford lecturer and cybersecurity expert. The system is behind technologically and plagued by a constant challenge among government and nonprofit tech platforms: the lack of highly skilled engineers, who can get paid far higher salaries in the tech industry. Sometimes those employees are even poached by the same companies that send in the reports. Then there are legal constraints. According to the report, court decisions have led the staff at NCMEC to stop vetting some files (for instance, if they are not publicly available) before sending them to law enforcement. Many law enforcement officials believe they need a search warrant to access such images, slowing down the process. At times, multiple warrants or subpoenas are needed to identify the same offender. It\u2019s also easy for the system to get distracted. The report reveals that NCMEC recently hit a milestone of a million reports in a single day due to a meme that was spreading on multiple platforms -- which some people thought was funny and others were sharing out of outrage. \u201cThat day actually led them to make some changes,\u201d Stamos said. \u201cIt took them weeks to get through that backlog\u201d by making it easier to cluster those images together. The CyberTipline received more than 36 million reports in 2023, nearly all from online platforms. Facebook, Instagram and Google were the companies that sent in the highest number of reports. The overall number has been dramatically increasing. Nearly half of the tips sent last year were actionable, meaning NCMEC and law enforcement could follow up. Hundreds of reports concerned the same offender, and many included multiple images or videos. Around 92% of the reports filed in 2023 involved countries outside the U.S., a large shift from 2008 when the majority involved victims or offenders inside the U.S. Some are false alarms. \u201cIt drives law enforcement nuts when they get these reports that they perceive are definitely adults,\u201d Grossman told reporters. \u201cBut the system incentivizes platforms to be very conservative or to report potentially borderline content, because if it\u2019s found to have been CSAM and they knew about it and they didn\u2019t report it, they could receive fines.\u201d One relatively easy fix proposed in the report would improve how tech platforms label what they are reporting to distinguish between widely shared memes and something that deserves closer investigation. The Stanford researchers interviewed 66 people involved with the CyberTipLine, ranging from law enforcement to NCMEC staff to online platform employees. The NCMEC said it looked forward to \u201cexploring the recommendations internally and with key stakeholders.\u201d \u201cOver the years, the complexity of reports and the severity of the crimes against children continue to evolve. Therefore, leveraging emerging technological solutions into the entire CyberTipline process leads to more children being safeguarded and offenders being held accountable,\u201d it said in a statement. Among the report's other findings: \u2014 The CyberTipline reporting form doesn't have a dedicated field for submitting chat-related material, such as sextortion messaging. The FBI recently warned of a \u201chuge increase\u201d in sextortion cases targeting children \u2014 including financial sextortion, where someone threatens to release compromising images unless the victim pays. \u2014 Police detectives told Stanford researchers they are having a hard time persuading their higher-ups to prioritize these crimes even after they present them with detailed written descriptions to emphasize their gravity. \u201cThey wince when they read it and they don\u2019t really want to think about this,\u201d Grossman said. \u2014 Many law enforcement officials said they were not able to fully investigate all reports due to time and resource constraints. A single detective may be responsible for 2,000 reports a year. \u2014 Outside the U.S., especially in poorer countries, the challenges around child exploitation reports are especially severe. Law enforcement agencies might not have reliable internet connections, \u201cdecent computers\u201d or even gas for cars to execute search warrants. \u2014 Pending legislation passed by the U.S. Senate in December would require online platforms to report child sex trafficking and online enticement to the CyberTipline and give law enforcement more time to investigate child sexual exploitation. Currently, the tipline doesn't offer straightforward ways to report suspected sex trafficking. While some advocates have proposed more intrusive surveillance laws to catch abusers, Stamos, the former chief security officer at Facebook and Yahoo, said they should try simpler fixes first. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to violate the privacy of users if you want to put more pedophiles in jail. They\u2019re sitting right there,\u201d Stamos said. \u201cThe system does not work very well at taking the information that currently exists and then turning it into prosecutions.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-22 06:19:00",
            "content": "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong has long been a major producer and consumer of great food , and a great amount of plastic and Styrofoam to go with it. That\u2019s going to change as new legislation aiming to stop the sale and distribution of Styrofoam products and single-use plastic cutlery went into effect on Monday. Under the new law, single-use cutlery such as forks, spoons, straws and plates cannot be sold or distributed for both dine-in and takeaway customers. However, plastic food containers and cups can still be given out for takeaways. The regulation of disposable plastic tableware and other plastic products in Hong Kong aims to reduce their use at the source to cut down on pollution, Hong Kong\u2019s Environmental Protection Department said in an emailed response to The Associated Press. Restaurants were given a six-month grace period. A second phase of the ban, expected next year, will ban all single-use plastics including containers for both dine-in and takeaway. Many restaurants have already begun implementing the new measure. Kuen Fat Kitchen is a typical lunch stop for many people in Hong Kong. Even before the new law was introduced, it had already started to reduce the use of Styrofoam boxes. Owner Kitty Chan said the changes will mean higher costs. \u201cFor a single-use cutlery set, you might think it\u2019s just a small change, but switching the plastic spoon to a paper spoon doubles the cost for us. So, it\u2019s not so friendly to the business of the food and beverage industry,\u201d Chan added. Customers at Kuen Fat Kitchen have mixed feelings. Some don\u2019t want to face extra hassle when going out to eat if they are asked to bring their own containers and utensils. \u201cWhen I\u2019m at work, I only have an hour for lunch, and I need to eat efficiently. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s convenient for me to bring my own cutlery and do the washing up afterwards. It\u2019s not convenient and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said customer Darren Seng. Others recognized the environment al impacts of their dining-out habits. \u201cI think it's better for the environment,\u201d said resident Thomson Choi. Single-use plastic cutlery is the second-largest source of plastic waste after single-use plastic bags in Hong Kong, according to Greenpeace. Many businesses are changing to alternative plastics made of natural resources to comply with new rules, instead of improving their packaging, the organization added. Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam hopes that the new law will discourage the throwaway culture and promote reusables, instead of \u201cgreener\u201d disposables. \u201cAny kind of plastic ban policy should aim to influence the public to stay away from plastic. We should move on, and have a new approach,\u201d said Tam. \u201cBut we would like to remind the government that it should devote more resources to promote reusable instead of disposable. This is the way to solve the root of the problem.\u201d According to the latest figures by Hong Kong's government in 2022, the city disposed 11,128 tons of solid waste per day, among which plastics contributed 2,369 tons. Hong Kong is reliant on the city\u2019s three landfills to handle its waste, but they are expected to be filled up by around 2026, according to the government. The city plans to implement municipal solid waste charging from Aug. 1, but the logistics have yet to be worked out. It would compel individual homes, restaurants, and all businesses to pay for trash they throw away.",

            "content": "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog said Monday that U.S. search giant Google must fix its advertising search restrictions affecting Yahoo in Japan . The Japan Fair Trade Commission said in a statement that its recent study of Google\u2019s practices showed it was undermining fair competition in the advertising market. Yahoo Japan Corp., which has since merged with the Japanese social media platform Line, began keyword-targeted search advertising services using Google's technology after the two companies formed a tie-up in 2010. The FTC alleges that Google had imposed restrictions in its search advertising agreement with Yahoo Japan that for more than seven years hindered its ability to compete in targeted search ads. An FTC investigation into whether that violated the Anti-Monopoly Law led Google to drop the restrictions. Google said in an emailed statement that it has cooperated fully with the commission's probe, and stressed the commission has not found it had outright violated anti-monopoly laws. It promised to carry out the commission's directives to offer \u201cvaluable\u201d search functions to Japanese users and advertisers. Line Yahoo declined comment. Google will be under review for the next three years, to ensure it carries out needed changes, the commission said. It did not impose any fines or other penalties on Google, which remains popular among Japanese. The commission\u2019s move follows another setback for Google in Japan. Last week, Japanese doctors filed a civil lawsuit against the company, demanding damages for what they claim are groundless derogatory and often false comments. The Tokyo District Court suit demands 1.4 million yen ($9,400) in damages for 63 medical professionals, for reviews posted on Google Maps. Google said in response that it's working \u201c24 hours a day\u201d to reduce misleading or false information on its platform, combining human and technological resources \u201cto delete fraudulent reviews.\u201d ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",

            "date": "2024-04-22 01:10:00",
            "content": "BAGHDAD -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Iraq on Monday for his first official visit in more than a decade as his country seeks greater cooperation from Baghdad in its fight against a Kurdish militant group that has a foothold in northern Iraq. Other issues also loom large between the two countries, including water supply issues and exports of oil and gas from northern Iraq to Turkey , which have been halted for more than a year. Erdogan\u2019s last visit to Iraq was in 2011, when he was Turkey\u2019s prime minister. Iraqi government spokesperson Bassem al-Awadi said in a statement that Erdogan\u2019s visit will be a \u201cmajor starting point in Iraqi-Turkish relations\u201d and will include the signing of a deal on a \u201cjoint approach to security challenges\u201d and a \u201cstrategic agreement on the water file,\u201d among other issues. Erdogan has said his country plans to launch a major operation against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist movement banned in Turkey and with operations in Iraq, during the summer, with the aim of \u201cpermanently\u201d eradicating the threat it poses. Turkey has carried out numerous ground offensives against the group in northern Iraq in the past while Turkish jets frequently target suspected PKK targets in the region. Ankara now aims to create a 30- to 40-kilometer (19 to 25-mile) deep security corridor along the joint border with Iraq, Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler told journalists last month. The group, whose fight for an autonomous Kurdish state in southeast Turkey has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1980s, is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. Baghdad has complained in the past that Turkish operations against the PKK violate its sovereignty, but appears to be coming closer to Ankara\u2019s stance. In March, after a meeting between the Iraqi and Turkish foreign ministers, Baghdad announced that the Iraqi National Security Council had issued a ban on the PKK, although it stopped short of designating it as a terrorist organization. The two countries issued a joint statement in which they said the group represents a \u201csecurity threat to both Turkey and Iraq\u201d and that its presence on Iraqi territory was a \u201cviolation of the Iraqi Constitution.\u201d Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told journalists during a visit to Washington last week that Iraq and Turkey have \u201ctrue interests with one another and common projects.\u201d He noted that the PKK has long had a presence in northern Iraq, \u201cbut we are not allowing any armed group to be on Iraqi territory and using it as a launch pad for attacks.\u201d Ankara has argued that the presence of PKK bases poses a threat to the planned construction of a major trade route, the Iraq Development Road, that would connect the port of Grand Faw in Basra, southern Iraq, to Turkey and Europe through a network of rail lines and highways. Baghdad might take a similar approach to the PKK as it has taken to Iranian Kurdish dissident groups based in northern Iraq. The presence of the Iranian dissidents had become a point of tension with Tehran, which periodically launched airstrikes on their bases in Iraq. Last summer, Iran and Iraq reached an agreement to disarm the dissident groups and relocate their members from military bases to displacement camps. Talks between Erdogan and Iraqi officials are also expected to focus on energy cooperation as well as the possible resumption of oil flow through a pipeline to Turkey. A pipeline running from the semiautonomous Kurdish region to Turkey has been shut down since March 2023, after an arbitration court ruling ordered Ankara to pay Iraq $1.5 billion for oil exports that bypassed the Iraqi central government. The sharing of oil and gas revenues has long been a contentious issue between Baghdad and Kurdish authorities in Irbil. Water rights are also likely to be a key issue on the table. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which provide most of Iraq\u2019s fresh water, originate in Turkey. In recent years, Iraqi officials have complained that dams installed by Turkey are reducing Iraq\u2019s water supply. Experts fear that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing water shortages in Iraq, with potentially devastating consequences. Mustafa Hassan, a resident of Baghdad said that he hopes that Erdogan\u2019s visit \u201cwill help to solve problems related to water, because Iraq is suffering from a water scarcity crisis, and this affects agriculture.\u201d ___ Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington, and Ali Jabar in Baghdad, contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 00:17:00",
            "content": "LAS VEGAS -- Work is set to begin Monday on a $12 billion high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area, with officials projecting millions of ticket-buyers will be boarding trains by 2028. Brightline West, whose sister company already operates a fast train between Miami and Orlando in Florida, aims to lay 218 miles (351 kilometers) of new track between a terminal to be built just south of the Las Vegas Strip and another new facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Almost the full distance is to be built in the median of Interstate 15, with a station stop in San Bernardino County\u2019s Victorville area. In a statement, Brightline Holdings founder and Chairperson Wes Edens called the moment \u201cthe foundation for a new industry.\u201d Brightline aims to link other U.S. cities that are too near to each other for flying between them to make sense and too far for people to drive the distance, Edens said. CEO Mike Reininger has said the goal is to have trains operating in time for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to take part in Monday's groundbreaking. Brightline received $6.5 billion in backing from the Biden administration, including a $3 billion grant from federal infrastructure funds and approval to sell another $2.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds. The company won federal authorization in 2020 to sell $1 billion in similar bonds. The project is touted as the first true high-speed passenger rail line in the nation, designed to reach speeds of 186 mph (300 kph), comparable to Japan\u2019s Shinkansen bullet trains. The route between Vegas and L.A. is largely open space, with no convenient alternate to I-15. Brightline\u2019s Southern California terminal will be at a commuter rail connection to downtown Los Angeles. The project outline says electric-powered trains will cut the four-hour trip across the Mojave Desert to a little more than two hours. Forecasts are for 11 million one-way passengers per year, or some 30,000 per day, with fares well below airline travel costs. The trains will offer rest rooms, Wi-Fi, food and beverage sales and the option to check luggage. Las Vegas is a popular driving destination for Southern Californians. Officials hope the train line will relieve congestion on I-15, where motorists often sit in miles of crawling traffic while returning home from a Las Vegas weekend. The Las Vegas area, now approaching 3 million residents, draws more than 40 million visitors per year. Passenger traffic at the city's Harry Reid International Airport set a record of 57.6 million people in 2023. An average of more than 44,000 automobiles per day crossed the California-Nevada state line on I-15 in 2023, according to Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority data. Florida-based Brightline Holdings already operates the Miami-to-Orlando line with trains reaching speeds up to 125 mph (200 kph). It launched service in 2018 and expanded service to Orlando International Airport last September. It offers 16 round-trips per day, with one-way tickets for the 235-mile (378-kilometer) distance costing about $80. Other fast trains in the U.S. include Amtrak\u2019s Acela, which can top 150 mph (241 kph) while sharing tracks with freight and commuter service between Boston and Washington, D.C. Ideas for connecting other U.S. cities with high-speed passenger trains have been floated in recent years, including Dallas to Houston; Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina; and Chicago to St. Louis. Most have faced delays. In California, voters in 2008 approved a proposed 500-mile (805-kilometer) rail line linking Los Angeles and San Francisco, but the plan has been beset by rising costs and routing disputes. A 2022 business plan by the California High-Speed Rail Authority projected the cost had more than tripled to $105 billion.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 00:01:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- Wall Street is holding steadier Monday following its three-week losing streak. The S & P 500 was 0.3% higher in morning trading, coming off its longest weekly losing streak since September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 99 points, or 0.3%, as of 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher. Zions Bancorp. climbed after reporting stronger earnings for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts called it a solid showing, and its stock rose 2.7% to recover some of the sharp slide it took last year on worries surrounding the strength of the larger regional-banking industry. That helped offset a 4% drop for Tesla, which announced more cuts to prices over the weekend. Elon Musk\u2019s electric-vehicle company has seen its stock drop more than 40% already this year, and it will report its first-quarter results on Tuesday. It\u2019s a big week for earnings reports generally, with roughly 30% of the companies in the S & P 500 scheduled to say how much they made during the year\u2019s first three months. That includes several companies that have come to be known as part of the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d beyond Tesla. This handful of companies was responsible for the majority of the S & P 500\u2019s big gain last year, raising the bar of expectations for them to justify their stock prices. Analysts believe those seven stocks, as a group, saw growth in their earnings per share slow to 39% last quarter from 63% at the end of last year, according to strategists at Bank of America. This past quarter may also have marked the trough for earnings declines among the other 493 companies in the index. The difference in growth between them and the Magnificent Seven should close by the end of the year, strategists Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian said in a BofA Global Research Report. Verizon Communications helped kick off this week's reports by disclosing a drop in profit that wasn't quite as bad as analysts expected. It cited price increases and other measures to support its revenue. Verizon's stock swung from an early gain to a loss of 3.7% after it reported weaker revenue for the first quarter than expected and kept its forecast for full-year profit the same. Even more pressure than usual is on companies broadly to deliver fatter profits and revenue. That\u2019s because the other big factor that sets stock prices, interest rates, looks unlikely to offer much help in the near term. Top officials at the Federal Reserve warned last week that they may need to keep interest rates high for a while in order to ensure high inflation is heading down to their 2% target. That was a big letdown for financial markets, dousing hopes that had built after the Fed earlier signaled three cuts may come this year. Lower rates had earlier appeared to be on the horizon after inflation cooled sharply last year. But a string of reports this year showing inflation has remained hotter than expected has raised worries about stalled progress. Traders are now largely forecasting just one or two cuts to rates this year, according to data from CME Group, down from expectations for six or more at the start of the year. They\u2019re also betting on the possibility of no cuts to rates this year. Worries about \u201csticky\u201d inflation are one of the reasons strategists at Stifel are encouraging caution. Stocks generally look more expensive, in part because of a frenzy on Wall Street around anything related to artificial-intelligence technology. Some analysts are suggesting stock prices could keep steaming ahead as the mania builds even higher around AI, but Stifel's Barry Bannister and Thomas Carroll point to some signs that \u201cthe speculative fever would break\u201d for tech, including a possible top for the price of bitcoin. They suggest market caution well into the year's third quarter, which stretches from July through September. Bitcoin remains below its peak set a month ago, but it rose Monday. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was holding steady at 4.63%. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.97% from 4.99% late Friday. In markets abroad, stocks rose 1.8% in Hong Kong but fell 0.7% in Shanghai after the People\u2019s Bank of China kept its 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates unchanged. The Chinese central bank is waiting to see if more stimulus is needed after the economy expanded at a faster-than-expected rate in the first three months of the year, according to analysts. Indexes were higher across much of the rest of Asia and Europe. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",

Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk promised in 2019 that there would be a fleet of robotaxis on the road in 2020, but the promise has yet to materialize, and the system still has to be supervised by humans. The cuts, which occurred on Saturday, follow Tesla's moves to slash $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the United States late Friday. That's the latest evidence of the challenges facing the electric vehicle maker. Tesla reduced the prices of the Model Y, a small SUV which is Tesla\u2019s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the U.S., and also of the Models X and S, its older and more expensive models. Prices for the Model 3 sedan and the Cybertruck stayed the same. The price reduction came the day after Tesla\u2019s stock dropped below $150 per share, wiping out all gains made over the past year. The Austin, Texas, company\u2019s stock price has dropped about 40% so far this year amid falling sales and increased competition.

Musk, a self-declared free speech absolutist, is a target in an ongoing investigation over the dissemination of fake news by supporters of Bolsonaro. Musk said the social platform X wouldn't comply with a high court justice's order to remove certain accounts accused of spreading disinformation.

He noted on X that users could seek to bypass any shutdown of the social media platform by using VPNs, or virtual private networks.

The A24 election -year gamble, the indie studio\u2019s biggest budgeted film yet, took in $11.1 million in ticket sales at 3,929 theaters over the weekend. The $50 million film, set in a near-future U.S. in which Texas and California have joined in rebellion against a fascist president, has grossed $44.9 million in two weeks. Its provocative premise \u2013 and A24\u2019s marketing, which included images of U.S. cities ravaged by war \u2013 helped keep \u201cCivil War\u201d top of mind for moviegoers. But it was a painfully slow weekend in theaters \u2013 the kind sure to add to concern over what\u2019s thus far been a down year for Hollywood at the box office. Year-to-date ticket sales are down almost 20% compared to last year, according to Comscore. Going into the weekend, Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cAbigail,\u201d a critically acclaimed R-rated horror film about the daughter of Dracula, had been expected to lead ticket sales. It came in second with $10.2 million in 3,384 theaters. That was still a fair result for a film that cost a modest $28 million to make. \u201cAbigail,\u201d which remakes the 1936 monster film \u201cDracula\u2019s Daughter,\u201d is about a 12-year-old girl taken by kidnappers who soon realize they\u2019ve made a poor choice of hostage. It\u2019s directed by the duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett whose production company goes by the name Radio Silence. More concerning was the overall tepid response for a handful of new wide releases \u2013 and the likelihood that there will be more similar weekends throughout 2024. Last year\u2019s actors and writers' strikes, which had a prolonged effect on the movie pipeline, exacerbated holes in Hollywood\u2019s release schedule. Horror films, in recent years among the most reliable cash cows in theaters, also haven\u2019t thus far been doing the automatic business they previous did. According to David A. Gross, who runs the consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, horror releases accounted for $2 billion in worldwide sales in 2023. Guy Ritchie\u2019s \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\u201d debuted with $9 million in 2,845 theaters. In the based-on-a-true-story Lionsgate release, which reportedly cost $60 million to produce, Henry Cavill leads a World War II mission off the coast of West Africa. Though Ritchie has been behind numerous box-office hits, including the live-action \u201cAladdin\u201d and a pair of Sherlock Holmes films, his recent movies have struggled to find big audiences. The Lionsgate spy comedy \u201cOperation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre\u201d grossed $48 million against a $50 million budget, while MGM\u2019s \u201cThe Covenant,\u201d also released last year, made $21 million while costing $55 million to make. A bright sign for \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\u201d: audiences liked it. The film earned an A-minus CinemaScore. The anime \u201cSpy x Family Code: White,\u201d from Sony\u2019s Crunchyroll, also struggled to stand out with audiences. Though the adaptation of the Tatsuya Endo manga TV series \u201cSpy x Family\u201d has already been a hit with international moviegoers, it debuted below expectations with $4.9 million in 2,009 U.S. theaters. The mightiest film globally, though, continues to be \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\u201d The Warner Bros. monster movie has for the past month led worldwide ticket sales. It added another $9.5 million domestically and $21.6 million internationally to bring its four-week global total to $485.2 million.

            "content": "CHEROKEE, N.C. -- Medical marijuana can now be legally purchased in North Carolina with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians opening its long-planned dispensary this weekend on tribal land. Hundreds of people, many with approved medical patient cards to purchase items, celebrated the historic opening of the Great Smoky Cannabis Co. on Saturday within the Eastern Band land known as the Qualla Boundary, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported. Saturday was April 20, which is also known as \u201c420 Day,\u201d or an annual day for the celebration of marijuana. The ceremony marks the latest liberalization of marijuana rules by the tribe, which in 2021 decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana within its 89 square miles (231 square kilometers) of land in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The tribe also formed a medical marijuana system that included a tribe-created business to grow cannabis and sell it, reaping financial rewards for the tribal members and assisting those with medical conditions. \u201cThis project will change the trajectory of their lives forever,\u201d Forrest Parker, general manager for Qualla Enterprises, the tribal company that manages the dispensary, said during the opening ceremony. \u201cIt will be a conduit to generations of social, economic and spiritual growth, unlike anything that\u2019s ever been witnessed.\u201d The Eastern Band, with about 14,000 members, can pass rules permitting cannabis as a sovereign nation and federally recognized tribe. Marijuana use remains illegal in the rest of North Carolina. Still, Republican U.S. Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd have raised concerns with federal and state law enforcement about whether drug laws will continue to be carried out in light of the dispensary. A statewide medical marijuana bill has been considered in recent years by the North Carolina General Assembly. Adults at least 21 years of age with a tribe medical cannabis patient card or an out-of-state approved medical marijuana card can purchase items at Great Smoky Cannabis Co. The scope of marijuana sales could become much greater. A majority of Eastern Band voters backed in a referendum last September the adult, recreational use of marijuana on tribal land. The question also asked whether voters supported the tribal council to develop legislation to regulate such a market. The Charlotte Observer reported that an adult use ordinance could be finalized in June, citing council member Boyd Owle. \u201cLet\u2019s get it right before we put it out there. But we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d Owle said after a council work session on the ordinance earlier this month. The dispensary could generate over $200 million in gross sales revenues in its first year if limited to medical patients, compared with $385 million if the product is available to all adult users, according to figures from Qualla Enterprises released before last year\u2019s adult-use referendum. Saturday\u2019s ceremony featured tribal translator Myrtle Driver Johnson purchasing the first medical marijuana in a transaction made in English and Cherokee. She said that she had named and translated the different strains of cannabis into Cherokee.",

            "title": "Biden sees a $35 price cap for insulin as a pivotal campaign issue. It\u2019s not that clear-cut",
            "date": "2024-04-21 07:41:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- Rarely a day goes without President Joe Biden mentioning insulin prices. He promotes a $35 price cap for the medication for Americans on Medicare \u2014 in White House speeches, campaign stops and even at non-health care events around the country. His reelection team has flooded swing-state airwaves with ads mentioning it, in English and Spanish. All that would seemingly add up to a sweeping political and economic impact. The reality is more complicated. As his campaign tries to emphasize what it sees as an advantage over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, Biden often overstates what those people who are eligible for the price cap once paid for insulin. It\u2019s also not clear whether the number of Americans being helped will be enough to help sway November\u2019s election , even in the most closely contested states that could come down to a few thousand votes. \u201cIt is about political signaling in a campaign much more than it is about demonstrating for people that they benefit from the insulin cap,\u201d said Drew Altman, president and CEO of KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. \u201cIt is a way to make concrete the fact that you are the health care candidate.\u201d Many who are benefiting from the price cap were already getting insulin at reduced prices, were already Biden supporters, or both. Others who need reduced-price insulin, meanwhile, cannot get it because they do not have Medicare or private health insurance . Biden\u2019s campaign is emphasizing the president's successful efforts to reduce insulin prices and contrasting that with Trump, who first ran for president promising to lower drug prices but took limited action in office. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful and tangible contrast,\u201d said Biden campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one we are campaigning on early, aggressively, and across our coalition.\u201d Roughly 8.4 million people in the United States control their blood sugar levels with insulin, and more than 1 million have Type 1 diabetes and could die without regular access to it. The White House says nearly 4 million older people qualify for the new, lower price. The price cap for Medicare recipients was part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which originally sought to cap insulin at $35 for all those with health insurance. When it passed in 2022, it was scaled back by congressional Republicans to apply only to older adults. The Biden administration has also announced agreements with drugmakers Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, to cap insulin co-payments at $35 for those with private insurance. They account for more than 90% of the U.S. insulin market. But Biden says constantly that many people used to pay up to $400 monthly, which is an overstatement. A Department of Health and Human Services study released in December 2022 found that people with diabetes who were enrolled in Medicare or had private insurance paid an average of $452 annually, not monthly. The high prices the president cites mostly affected people without health insurance. But the rates of the uninsured have fallen to record lows because of the Obama administration\u2019s signature health care law and the Biden White House\u2019s aggressive efforts to ensure those eligible to enroll are doing so more frequently. So, in effect, one of the administration\u2019s policy initiatives is undermining the economic argument for another. That effort has not reached everyone, though. Yanet Martinez who lives in Phoenix and supports Biden. She does not work or have health insurance, but gets insulin for around $16 per month thanks to steep discounts at her local clinic. The lower prices only apply if her husband, a landscaper, does not make enough to exceed the monthly income limit. If he does, her insulin can jump to $500-plus, she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people talk about the price of insulin going down. I\u2019ve not seen it,\u201d said Martinez, 42. \u201cIt should be uniform. There are a lot of people who don\u2019t have any way to afford it and it makes things very difficult.\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., is sponsoring bipartisan legislation to make the $35 insulin cap universal, even for people without health insurance. In the meantime, he said, what's been accomplished with Medicare recipients and drugmakers agreeing to reduce their prices is \"literally saving lives and saving people money.\u201d \u201cThis is good policy because it centers the people rather than the politics,\" Warnock said. He said that as he travels Georgia, a pivotal swing state in November, people say \u201cthank you for doing this for me, or for someone in my family.\u201d That includes people like Tommy Marshall, a 56-year-old financial services consultant in Atlanta, who has health insurance. He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 45 and injects fast-acting insulin several times daily. He paid about $250 for four weeks to eight weeks worth of medication last November, but saw the price fall by half in February, after Novo Nordisk agreed to cut prices. \u201cIf I was his political consultant, I\u2019d be telling (Biden) to talk about it constantly,\" said Marshall, a lifelong Democrat and longtime public advocate for cutting insulin prices, including for the advocacy group Protect Our Care Georgia. Marshall said the price caps \u201chave meaningful emotional resonance\u201d and could sway a close election but also conceded, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 18- to 65-year-olds. I can just imagine there\u2019s probably two or three other issues that are in front of this one.\u201d \u201cMaybe someone sort of on-the-fence, he added \u201cthis could maybe sway them.\u201d Geoff Garin, a pollster for Biden's reelection campaign, said the insulin cap is one of the president's highest performing issues. He said the data was \u201cclear, consistent and overwhelming.\u201d Rich Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which has endorsed Biden, called the insulin cap a strong issue for the president among older voters. \u201cFor the persuadables \u2014 and there are some still out there, believe it or not \u2014 drug costs are a very important factor,\u201d said Fiesta, whose group has 4.4-million members and advocates for health and economic security for older people. Trump's campaign did not respond to questions. But Theo Merkel, senior fellow at the conservative Paragon Health Institute, countered that the insulin price cut an example of \"policies written to fit the talking points other than the other way around.\u201d Merkel, who was a Trump White House adviser on health policy, said manufacturers that have long made insulin prefer caps on how much the insured pay because it gives them more leverage to secure higher prices from insurance companies. The president's approval ratings on health care are among his highest on a range of issues, but still only 42% of U.S. adults approve of Biden\u2019s handling of health care while 55% disapprove, according to a February poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. KFF found in its own poll in December that that 59% of U.S. adults trust the Democratic Party to do a better job addressing health care affordability issues compared to 39% for Republicans, even if only 26% of respondents in the same poll said they knew about the insulin price cap. \u201cIn political terms, the Democrats and Biden have an advantage on health care,\" Altman said. \u201cThey're pressing it.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-21 04:57:00",
            "content": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian and Western leaders on Sunday welcomed a desperately needed aid package passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, as the Kremlin warned that passage of the bill would \u201cfurther ruin\u201d Ukraine and cause more deaths. Ukrainian commanders and analysts say the long-awaited $61 billion military aid package \u2014 including $13.8 billion for Ukraine to buy weapons \u2014 will help slow Russia\u2019s incremental advances in the war's third year \u2014 but that more will likely be needed for Kyiv to regain the offensive. The House swiftly approved $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies in a rare Saturday session as Democrats and Republicans banded together after months of hard-right resistance over renewed American support for repelling Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had warned that his country would lose the war without U.S. funding, said that he was grateful for U.S. lawmaker' decision. Speaking on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Zelenskyy said that the aid package would \u201csend the Kremlin a powerful signal that (Ukraine) will not be the second Afghanistan.\u201d Zelenskyy said Ukraine would prioritize long-range weapons and air defenses to \u201cbreak the plans of Russia\u201d in an expected \u201cfull-scale offensive,\" for which Ukrainian forces are preparing. The aid package will go to the U.S. Senate, which could pass it as soon as Tuesday. U.S. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately. It still could take weeks for it to reach the front line, where it is desperately needed. \"With this we can stop (Russian troops) and reduce our losses,\" said infantry soldier Oleksandr. He has been fighting around Avdiivka, the city in the Donetsk region that Ukraine lost to Russia in February after months of intense combat. Ammunition shortages linked to the aid holdup over the past six months have led Ukrainian military commanders to ration shells, a disadvantage that Russia seized on this year \u2014 taking the city of Avdiivka and currently inching towards the town of Chasiv Yar, also in Donetsk. \u201cThe Russians come at us in waves \u2014 we become exhausted, we have to leave our positions. This is repeated many times,\u201d Oleksandr told The Associated Press. He didn't give his full name for security reasons. \u201cNot having enough ammunition means we can\u2019t cover the area that is our responsibility to hold when they are assaulting us.\u201d In Kyiv, many welcomed the U.S. vote as a piece of good news after a tough period that has seen Russia grind out gains along the front line, and step up attacks on Ukraine's energy system and other infrastructure. \u201cI heard our president officially say that we can lose the war without this help. Thanks very much and yesterday was a great event,\" said Kateryna Ruda, 43. Tatyana Ryavchenuk, the wife of a Ukrainian soldier, noted the need for more weapons, lamenting that soldiers \u201chave nothing to protect us.\" \"They need weapons, they need gear, they need it. We always need help. Because without help, our enemy can advance further and can be in the center of our city,\u201d the 26-year-old said. Other Western leaders, who have been scrambling to come up with ways to fill the gap left by stalled U.S. military aid, also lauded Congress' decision. \u201cUkraine is using the weapons provided by NATO Allies to destroy Russian combat capabilities. This makes us all safer, in Europe & North America,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg posted on X. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that \u201cUkraine deserves all the support it can get against Russia,\u201d and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the vote it \u201ca strong signal in these times.\u201d Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk thanked House Speaker Mike Johnson, while also noting the holdup in Congress. \u201cBetter late than too late. And I hope it is not too late for Ukraine,\u201d he wrote on X. In Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Saturday called the approval of aid to Ukraine \u201cexpected and predictable.\u201d The decision \u201cwill make the United States of America richer, further ruin Ukraine and result in the deaths of even more Ukrainians, the fault of the Kyiv regime,\u201d Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Ria Novosti. \u201cThe new aid package will not save, but, on the contrary, will kill thousands and thousands more people, prolong the conflict, and bring even more grief and devastation,\u201d Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs, wrote on Telegram. Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said the logistics of getting U.S. assistance to the front line would mean that \u201cUkrainian forces may suffer additional setbacks\" while waiting for it to arrive. \u201cBut they will likely be able to blunt the current Russian offensive assuming the resumed U.S. assistance arrives promptly,\" it said in its latest assessment of the conflict. Olexiy Haran, professor of comparative politics at the National University of Kyiv-Mohlya Academy, said that Ukraine was grateful for aid from the U.S. and other Western countries, \u201cbut the problem is, frankly speaking, it\u2019s too late and it\u2019s not enough.\" \u201cThis is the third year of the war and we still don\u2019t have aviation, new aviation. We don\u2019t have enough missiles, so we cannot close the skies. Moreover, recently we didn\u2019t have even artillery shells,\" he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the situation was very, very difficult and the Russians used it to start their offensive. So that\u2019s why it is so important for us. And definitely if we\u2019d received it half a year before, we would have saved the lives of many Ukrainians, civilians included.\u201d Matthew Savill, military sciences director at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said that the aid, while welcome, \u201ccan probably only help stabilize the Ukrainian position for this year and begin preparations for operations in 2025.\u201d \u201cPredictability of funding through 2024 and into 2025 will help the Ukrainians plan the defense this year, especially if European supplies of ammunition also come through, but further planning and funds will be required for 2025, and we have a U.S. election between now and then,\u201d he said. Responding to a question on NBC about how long Ukraine will still need aid packages, Zelenskyy said \"it depends on when we actually get weapons on the ground.\u201d \u201cThe decision to supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, we had it a year ago,\" he said. \"We still don\u2019t have the jets in Ukraine.\u201d In other developments: \u2014 On the ground, Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday that its troops had taken control of the village of Bohdanivka in the Donetsk region. Ukrainian officials haven't yet commented. \u2014 One person was killed and four others were wounded in Russian shelling in Ukrainsk on Sunday, according to the prosecutor's office in Ukraine's partially occupied Donetsk region. In the Odesa region, four people were wounded in a missile attack, Gov. Oleh Kiper said. \u2014 Two suspects were detained Sunday after two Ukrainian soldiers killed a police officer at a checkpoint in the Vinnytsia region. The soldiers opened fire on Maksym Zaretskyi, 20, early Saturday after he stopped their car for a routine inspection. Zaretskyi\u2019s partner was wounded but survived. The head of Ukraine\u2019s National Police, Ivan Vyhovsky, said the suspects, a father and son aged 52 and 26, were detained in Ukraine\u2019s Odesa region. ___ Elise Morton reported from London.

            "title": "Hawaii lawmakers take aim at vacation rentals after Lahaina wildfire amplifies Maui housing crisis",
            "date": "2024-04-21 01:20:00",
            "content": "HONOLULU -- Amy Chadwick spent years scrimping and saving as a single mother of two to buy a house in the town of Lahaina on the Hawaii an island of Maui. But after a devastating fire leveled Lahaina in August and reduced Chadwick's home to white dust, the cheapest rental she and her now-husband could find for their family and dogs cost $10,000 a month. Chadwick, a fine-dining server, moved to Florida where she could stretch her homeowners insurance dollars. She\u2019s worried Maui\u2019s exorbitant rental prices, driven in part by vacation rentals that hog a limited housing supply, will hollow out her tight-knit town. Most people in Lahaina work for hotels, restaurants and tour companies and can\u2019t afford $5,000 to $10,000 a month in rent, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re pushing out an entire community of service industry people. So no one\u2019s going to be able to support the tourism that you\u2019re putting ahead of your community,\u201d Chadwick said by phone from her new home in Satellite Beach on Florida\u2019s Space Coast. \u201cNothing good is going to come of it unless they take a serious stance, putting their foot down and really regulating these short-term rentals.\u201d The Aug. 8 wildfire killed 101 people and destroyed housing for 6,200 families, amplifying Maui's already acute housing shortage and laying bare the enormous presence of vacation rentals in Lahaina. It reminded lawmakers that short-term rentals are an issue across Hawaii , prompting them to consider bills that would give counties the authority to phase them out. Gov. Josh Green got so frustrated he blurted out an expletive during a recent news conference. \u201cThis fire uncovered a clear truth, which is we have too many short-term rentals owned by too many individuals on the mainland and it is b\u2014\u2014\u2014t,\u201d Green said. \u201cAnd our people deserve housing, here.\u201d Vacation rentals are a popular alternative to hotels for those seeking kitchens, lower costs and opportunities to sample everyday island life. Supporters say they boost tourism, the state's biggest employer. Critics revile them for inflating housing costs, upending neighborhoods and contributing to the forces pushing locals and Native Hawaiians to leave Hawaii for less expensive states. This migration has become a major concern in Lahaina. The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, a nonprofit, estimates at least 1,500 households \u2014 or a quarter of those who lost their homes \u2014 have left since the August wildfire. The blaze burned single family homes and apartments in and around downtown, which is the core of Lahaina's residential housing. An analysis by the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization found a relatively low 7.5% of units there were vacation rentals as of February 2023. Lahaina neighborhoods spared by the fire have a much higher ratio of vacation rentals: About half the housing in Napili, about 7 miles (11 kilometers) north of the burn zone, is short-term rentals. Napili is where Chadwick thought she found a place to buy when she first went house hunting in 2016. But a Canadian woman secured it with a cash offer and turned it into a vacation rental. Also outside the burn zone are dozens of short-term rental condominium buildings erected decades ago on land zoned for apartments. In 1992, Maui County explicitly allowed owners in these buildings to rent units for less than 180 days at a time even without short-term rental permits. Since November, activists have occupied the beach in front of Lahaina's biggest hotels to push the mayor or governor to use their emergency powers to revoke this exemption. Money is a powerful incentive for owners to rent to travelers: a 2016 report prepared for the state found a Honolulu vacation rental generates 3.5 times the revenue of a long-term rental. State Rep. Luke Evslin, the Housing Committee chair, said Maui and Kauai counties have suffered net losses of residential housing in recent years thanks to a paucity of new construction and the conversion of so many homes to short-term rentals. \u201cEvery alarm bell we have should be ringing when we\u2019re literally going backwards in our goal to provide more housing in Hawaii,\u201d he said. In his own Kauai district, Evslin sees people leaving, becoming homeless or working three jobs to stay afloat. The Democrat was one of 47 House members who co-sponsored one version of legislation that would allow short-term rentals to be phased out. One objective is to give counties more power after a U.S. judge ruled in 2022 that Honolulu violated state law when it attempted to prohibit rentals for less than 90 days. Evslin said that decision left Hawaii's counties with limited tools, such as property taxes, to control vacation rentals. Lawmakers also considered trying to boost Hawaii's housing supply by forcing counties to allow more houses to be built on individual lots. But they watered down the measure after local officials said they were already exploring the idea. Short-term rental owners said a phase-out would violate their property rights and take their property without compensation, potentially pushing them into foreclosure. Some predicted legal challenges. Alicia Humiston, president of the Rentals by Owner Awareness Association, said some areas in West Maui were designed for travelers and therefore lack schools and other infrastructure families need. \u201cThis area in West Maui that is sort of like this resort apartment zone \u2014 that\u2019s all north of Lahaina \u2014 it was never built to be local living,\u201d Humiston said. One housing advocate argues that just because a community allowed vacation rentals decades ago doesn't mean it still needs to now. \"We are not living in the 1990s or in the 1970s,\u201d said Sterling Higa, executive director of Housing Hawaii's Future. Counties \u201cshould have the authority to look at existing laws and reform them as necessary to provide for the public good.\u201d Courtney Lazo, a real estate agent who is part of Lahaina Strong, the group occupying Kaanapali Beach, said tourists can stay in her hometown now but many locals can't. \u201cHow do you expect a community to recover and heal and move forward when the people who make Lahaina, Lahaina, aren\u2019t even there anymore?\u201d she said at a recent news conference as her voice quivered. \u201cThey\u2019re moving away.\u201d",

            "title": "Autoworkers union celebrates breakthrough win in Tennessee and takes aim at more plants in the South",
            "date": "2024-04-20 17:36:00",
            "content": "DALLAS -- The United Auto Workers' overwhelming election victory at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee is giving the union hope that it can make broader inroads in the South, the least unionized part of the country. The UAW won a stunning 73% of the vote at VW after losing elections in 2014 and 2019. It was the union's first win in a Southern assembly plant owned by a foreign automaker. Union President Shawn Fain said the pundits all told him that the UAW couldn't win in the South. \u201cBut you all said, \u2018Watch this,\u2019 \u201d he told a cheering group of VW organizers at a union hall in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Friday night, when the UAW victory was clear. \"You guys are leading the way. We\u2019re going to carry this fight on to Mercedes and everywhere else.\u201d However, the UAW is likely to face a tougher test as it tries to represent workers at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. A five-day election is scheduled to start May 13, where the union\u2019s campaign has already become heated. The UAW has accused the German carmaker of violating U.S. and German labor laws with aggressive anti-union tactics, which the company denies. \u201cThey are going to have a much harder road in work sites where they are going to face aggressive management resistance and even community resistance than they faced in Chattanooga,\" said Harry Katz, a labor-relations professor at Cornell University. \"VW management did not aggressively seek to avoid unionization. Mercedes is going to be a good test. It's the deeper South.\u201d Late last year, the UAW announced a drive to represent nearly 150,000 workers at non-union factories largely in the South. The union is targeting U.S. plants run by Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW and Volvo, along with factories operated by electric-vehicle makers Tesla, Rivian and Lucid. The union's last defeat at VW in Chattanooga came at a low-water mark \u2014 in the middle of a federal investigation into bribery and embezzlement under a previous president. Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who studies the UAW, said the union flipped the script by installing new leadership, touting the rich contracts it won last year from Detroit automakers after strikes at targeted factories, and exploiting a climate that is now more favorable to unions. He said the union was also adept at translating signed pro-union authorization cards into votes \u2014 partly by pushing for a quick election. \u201cNow the public and media eyes are going to be on Chattanooga and how quickly the UAW can translate this into a contract,\u201d he said. If the union can't quickly get a good contract, it risks losing some of the momentum it gained with Friday's election win, he said. Unions in other industries are already moving ahead with organizing campaigns in the South and trying to learn from the UAW's playbook. The Association of Flight Attendants, which has tried and failed to win over cabin crews at Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, hopes to collect enough signatures to force another election at Delta by year end. The union's president, Sara Nelson, said she was not surprised at the UAW win after strikes that led to record contracts last year. \u201cI've been talking about this for a long time \u2014 that strikes and taking on the boss is going to spur organizing, and that's exactly what we saw here,\u201d Nelson said. Nelson is trying to secure an industry-leading contract at United Airlines that she can use to court Delta crews. In the meantime, crews at startup Breeze Airways, many of whom live in the South, will vote next month whether to join her union. The White House issued a statement from President Joe Biden congratulating the UAW. Biden \u2014 who joined a UAW picket line in Michigan during the union's strike against Ford, GM and Stellantis plants last year \u2014 praised the success of unions representing autoworkers, Hollywood actors and writers, health care workers and others in gaining better contracts. \u201cTogether, these union wins have helped raise wages and demonstrate once again that the middle-class built America and that unions are still building and expanding the middle class for all workers,\u201d Biden said. Biden criticized six Southern Republican governors, including Bill Lee of Tennessee, who told autoworkers this week that voting for union representation would jeopardize jobs. Sharon Block, a law professor at Harvard University who worked for the Biden administration on labor and other issues, said the governors\u2019 warning rang hollow after nonunion Tesla revealed that it plans to lay off 10% of its workers after disappointing sales results. She said VW workers saw the governors' open letter as \u201can empty threat and a cynical ploy,\u201d and they ignored it. \u201cWorkers for a long time have been told that you can\u2019t organize in the South. And many workers, even not in the South, may work in industries where they\u2019ve been told for a long time you can\u2019t organize,\u201d Block said. \u201cWhat the UAW showed last night is that we need to go and rethink all those negative statements.\" ___ Associated Press writer Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina, contributed to this report.",

            "title": "New York lawmakers pass $237 billion budget with policies to jump-start housing market",
            "date": "2024-04-20 16:37:00",
            "content": "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York lawmakers passed a $237 billion state budget Saturday that includes plans to spur housing construction and combat unlicensed marijuana stores. The package also includes a raft of other measures such as expediting the closure of some state prisons, addressing a recent influx of migrants and continuing the pandemic-era policy of allowing people to buy takeout cocktails. The state Senate and Assembly finished working through several budget bills Saturday after hours of debate. The spending plan now moves to Gov. Kathy Hochul to be signed into law, which she is expected to do. The negotiations, which were conducted in private between the governor and top legislative leaders, largely hinged on a sweeping proposal to jump-start the state's housing market. The plan offers developers a tax break if they agree to rent a portion of apartments in new buildings for below market price. The deal also includes measures to protect some tenants against unreasonable rent increases and evictions, though it was not as comprehensive as many advocates had wanted. \u201cThis budget agreement represents the most significant improvement in housing policy in three generations,\u201d Hochul said in a statement. The state had a similar tax break before, but it expired in 2022. Hochul and other supporters have long said that such an incentive is a vital lure for development, though critics consider it too costly and favorable to developers. \u201cGovernor Hochul did not solve the housing crisis \u2014 instead she pushed through a housing deal written by the real estate industry to ensure they keep getting richer off the backs of hardworking tenants,\" Cea Weaver, the coalition director for Housing Justice for All, said in a statement. Lawmakers also moved to address the explosion of unlicensed cannabis storefronts in New York City. Bureaucratic hurdles have made it difficult for the state to shut down the shops, which have become ubiquitous in the Big Apple. To help solve the problem, the budget includes policies that would allow local law enforcement to more easily shutter stores accused of selling marijuana illicitly while their cases play out. Previously, most enforcement could only be done by the state, and such stores were able to stay open while a lengthy appeals process played out. State officials also earmarked $2.4 billion to care for an influx of international migrants who have overwhelmed New York City's homeless shelters. The money will go toward housing, legal services and health care for the migrant population. State Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt criticized that measure during floor debates, saying it would encourage more migrants to come to New York. \u201cWe made a lot of tough decisions in this budget,\u201d Ortt said. \u201cBut 2.4 billion goes a long way, and I just wonder what that could have done in other parts of the budget for legal New Yorkers.\u201d Additionally, New York will expedite the closure of up to five state prisons in an effort to save money amid the state's declining prison population. The governor has until next March to choose which prisons will close. The state has shuttered two dozen correctional facilities since 2011 because of vacant beds, saving about $442 million annually, according to the state corrections department. The budget also contained measures that would offer paid time off during pregnancies, enable New York City to lower its speed limits and expand access to booze, with proposals to extend the pandemic-era sale of to-go alcoholic drinks and allow movie theaters to sell hard liquor. The budget was finalized about three weeks after its original April 1 due date and came after a cyberattack hampered the state office that drafts bills for the Legislature.",

            "date": "2024-04-20 13:23:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The House passed legislation Saturday that would ban TikTok in the United States if the popular social media platform's China -based owner doesn\u2019t sell its stake within a year, but don't expect the app to go away anytime soon. The decision by House Republicans to include TikTok as part of a larger foreign aid package, a priority for President Joe Biden with broad congressional support for Ukraine and Israel, fast-tracked the ban after an earlier version had stalled in the Senate. A standalone bill with a shorter, six-month selling deadline passed the House in March by an overwhelming bipartisan vote as both Democrats and Republicans voiced national security concerns about the app\u2019s owner, the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. The modified measure, passed by a 360-58 vote, now goes to the Senate after negotiations that lengthened the timeline for the company to sell to nine months, with a possible additional three months if a sale is in progress. Legal challenges could extend that timeline even further. The company has indicated that it would likely go to court to try and block the law if it passes, arguing it would deprive the app\u2019s millions of users of their First Amendment rights. TikTok has lobbied hard against the legislation, pushing the app\u2019s 170 million U.S. users \u2014 many of whom are young \u2014 to call Congress and voice opposition. But the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad concern about Chinese threats to the U.S. and where few members use the platform themselves. \u201cWe will not stop fighting and advocating for you,\u201d TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward the app\u2019s users. \u201cWe will continue to do all we can, including exercising our legal rights, to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you.\u201d The bill\u2019s quick path through Congress is extraordinary because it targets one company and because Congress has taken a hands-off approach to tech regulation for decades. Lawmakers had failed to act despite efforts to protect children online, safeguard users\u2019 privacy and make companies more liable for content posted on their platforms, among other measures. But the TikTok ban reflects widespread concerns from lawmakers about China. Members of both parties, along with intelligence officials, have worried that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over American user data or direct the company to suppress or boost TikTok content favorable to its interests. TikTok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government and has said it has not shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities. The U.S. government has not publicly provided evidence that shows TikTok shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government or tinkered with the company\u2019s popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see. The company has good reason to think a legal challenge could be successful, having seen some success in previous legal fights over its operations in the U.S.. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued. In 2020, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights. His administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. The sale never went through for a number of reasons; one was China, which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Dozens of states and the federal government have put in place TikTok bans on government devices. Texas\u2019 ban was challenged last year by The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which argued in a lawsuit that the policy was impeding academic freedom because it extended to public universities. In December, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have backed the app. \u201cCongress cannot take away the rights of over 170 million Americans who use TikTok to express themselves, engage in political advocacy, and access information from around the world,\u201d said Jenna Leventoff, a lawyer for the group. Since mid-March, TikTok has spent $5 million on TV ads opposing the legislation, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. The ads have included a range of content creators, including a nun, extolling the positive impacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the First Amendment. The company has also encouraged its users to contact Congress, and some lawmakers have received profanity-laced calls. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\u201d said Alex Haurek, a spokesman for the company. California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, voted against the legislation. He said he thinks there could have been less restrictive ways to go after the company that wouldn't result in a total ban or threaten free speech. \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to be well received,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the Beltway being out of touch with where voters are.\u201d Nadya Okamoto, a content creator who has roughly 4 million followers on TikTok, said she has been having conversations with other creators who are experiencing \u201cso much anger and anxiety\u201d about the bill and how it\u2019s going to impact their lives. The 26-year-old, whose company \u201cAugust\u201d sells menstrual products and is known for her advocacy around destigmatizing menstrual periods, makes most of her income from TikTok. \u201cThis is going to have real repercussions,\u201d she said. ___ Hadero reported from New York.",

            "content": "BALTIMORE -- A third temporary channel for boats to enter and depart the Port of Baltimore has opened, expanding further shipping access as collapsed sections of the Francis Scott Key Bridge are salvaged before the span can ultimately be rebuilt. The alternate channel, located to the northeast of the fallen bridge, is open to \u201ccommercially essential vessels,\u201d port officials announced late Friday. The new temporary path, with a controlling depth of 20 feet (6.1 meters), a horizontal clearance of 300 feet (91.4 meters) and a vertical clearance of 135 feet (41.2 meters), allows a greater variety of vessels to access the port while crews work to reopen the main channel, Coast Guard and port Capt. David O\u2019Connell said in a news release. With the new channel open, about 15% of pre-collapse commercial activity will resume, O'Connell said. The first temporary channel opened April 1. The bridge collapsed early March 26 after it was struck by the cargo ship Dali. Officials hope to open a channel by the end of the month to allow most maritime traffic back into one of the East Coast\u2019s busiest maritime transit hubs. Workers are laboring to remove thousands of tons of debris sitting atop the Dali, the cargo ship that veered off course and struck the 1.6-mile-long (2.57-kilometer-long) bridge. Six roadwork crew members on the bridge died. Two of their bodies have not been found. With massive cranes, workers so far have taken away about 1,300 tons (1,179 metric tons) of steel. The debris on the stationary ship must be removed before the vessel can be returned to the port.",

            "date": "2024-04-20 12:30:00",
            "content": "Tesla knocked $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the United States late Friday, another sign of the challenges facing the electric vehicle maker led by billionaire Elon Musk. The company cut the prices of the Model Y, a small SUV which is Tesla's most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the U.S., and also of the Models X and S, its older and more expensive models. Prices for the Model 3 sedan and the Cybertruck stayed the same. The cuts reduced the starting price for a Model Y to $42,990 and to $72,990 for a Model S and $77,990 for a Model X. The move came the day after Tesla's stock tumbled below $150 per share, eliminating all gains made over the past year. The Austin, Texas, company's stock price has dropped about 40% so far this year amid falling sales and increased competition. Discounted sticker prices are a way to try to entice more car buyers. Musk posted early Saturday on X, the social media platform known as Twitter before he acquired and renamed it, that the cost of an entry-level Tesla was as low as $29,490 once a federal tax credit and gas savings were factored in. Industry analysts have been waiting for Tesla to introduce a small electric vehicle that would cost around $25,000, the Model 2. Media reports this month that Musk planned to scrap the project created more uncertainty over the company's direction, although Musk called them untrue. The price cuts ended a long workweek at Tesla, which announced Monday that it was cutting 10% of its staff globally, about 14,000 jobs. The company also said it was recalling nearly 4,000 of its 2024 Cybertrucks after discovering the accelerator pedal can get stuck, potentially causing the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally and increase the risk of a crash. On Saturday, Musk confirmed he had postponed a planned weekend trip to India to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing \u201cvery heavy Tesla obligations.\u201d He said on X that he looked forward to rescheduling the visit for later this year. Tesla is scheduled to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The company reported earlier this month that its worldwide sales fell sharply from January through March as competition increased worldwide, electric vehicle sales growth slowed, and earlier price cuts failed to lure more buyers. It was Tesla's first year-over-year quarterly sales decline in nearly four years.",

            "content": "HELSINKI -- An artisan roastery based in the Finnish capital has introduced a coffee blend that has been developed by artificial intelligence in a trial in which it's hoped that technology can ease the workload in a sector that traditionally prides itself on manual work. It is only apt that the Helsinki-based Kaffa Roastery\u2019s \u201cAI-conic\u201d blend was launched this week in Finland, a Nordic nation of 5.6 million that consumes the most coffee in the world at 12 kilograms per capita annually, according to the International Coffee Organization. The blend \u2014 an AI-picked mixture with four types of beans dominated by Brazil\u2019s velvety Fazenda Pinhal \u2014 is the end result of a joint project by Kaffa, Finland\u2019s third-biggest coffee roastery, and local AI consultancy Elev. \u201cLeveraging models akin to ChatGPT and Copilot, the AI was tasked with crafting a blend that would ideally suit coffee enthusiasts\u2019 tastes, pushing the boundaries of conventional flavor combinations,\" Elev said. Kaffa Roastery\u2019s managing director and founder Svante Hampf told The Associated Press on Saturday that the two partners wanted to trial how AI and its different tools could be of help in coffee roasting, a traditional artisan profession highly valued in Finland. \u201cWe basically gave descriptions of all our coffee types and their flavors to AI and instructed it to create a new exciting blend,\u201d said Hampf, while showcasing \u201cAI-conic\u201d at the Helsinki Coffee Festival that annually brings together roasteries and coffee aficionados. In addition to coming up with its chosen mixture of beans from Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia and Guatemala, AI created the coffee package label and a detailed taste description saying \u201cAI-conic\u201d is \u201ca well balanced blend of sweetness and ripe fruit.\u201d Hampf acknowledged he was surprised that AI \u201csomewhat weirdly\u201d chose to make the blend out of four different type of coffee beans, rather than the usual two or three which allows distinction in taste between flavors from different origins. After the first test roasting and blind testing, Kaffa\u2019s coffee experts agreed, however, that the tech-assisted blend was perfect, and there was no need for human adjustments. According to Elev\u2019s spokesman Antti Merilehto \u201cAI-conic is a tangible example of how AI can introduce new perspectives to seasoned professionals\u201d while offering coffee lovers new taste experiences. Kaffa Roastery hopes the trial serves as an opener of dialogue between coffee professionals of things to come in the future in Finland, a nation that has both a strong coffee culture and a passion for technology with a flourishing startup scene. \u201cThis (trial) was the first step in seeing how AI could help us in the future,\u201d Hampf said, adding the project brought smoothly together \u201cthe artisan skills of a roastery\u201d and AI-provided data. \u201cI think AI has plenty to offer us in the long run. We are particularly impressed of the coffee taste descriptions it created.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-20 09:04:00",
            "content": "Pregnant employees have the right to a wide range of accommodations under new federal regulations for enforcing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that supporters say could change workplace culture for millions of people. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency in charge of enforcing the law, adopted an expansive view of conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth in its proposed regulations, including a controversial decision to include abortion, fertility treatment and birth control as medical issues requiring job protections. The rules, which were adopted on a 3-2 vote along partisan lines, were published Monday and offer extensive guidelines for addressing more routine difficulties of pregnancy, such as morning sickness, back pain and needing to avoid heavy lifting. Labor advocates say the law will be especially transformative for pregnant women in low-wage jobs, who are often denied simple requests like more bathroom breaks. Here's what to know about the law and the EEOC regulations. Congress passed the law with bipartisan support in December 2022 following a decade-long campaign by women's rights and labor advocates, who argued that the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act did little to guarantee women would receive the accommodations they might need at work. The law stated only that pregnant workers should be treated the same as other employees, not that they deserved special consideration. To get their requests met, many pregnant workers therefore needed to demonstrate they had physical limitations covered under the Americans With Disabilities Act, often creating insurmountable hurdles. The new law treats pregnancy and related conditions as themselves deserving of \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d and places the burden on employers to prove \u201cundue hardships\u201d for denying any requests. The law applies to employers of at least 15 workers. The EEOC estimates it will cover roughly 1.5 million pregnant workers in any given year. The EEOC regulations published April 15 are set to go into effect in June. The EEOC's 400-page document encompasses a wide array of conditions and relevant advice for employers. It states that workers are entitled to unpaid time off for situations such as prenatal appointments, fertility treatments, abortion, miscarriage, postpartum depression and mastitis, an infection that arises from breastfeeding. This includes workers who are not covered by federal family leave laws and those who have not been on the job long enough to accrue time off. Workers can ask for flexible working arrangements to deal with morning sickness, such as a later start time, clearance to work from home or permission to carry snacks in workplaces where eating is typically prohibited. If they can't sit or stand for extended periods due to sciatica, which is common in late pregnancy, they can request a schedule adjustment so their commutes happen during less crowded hours. The regulations also allow workers to be exempted from tasks such as climbing ladders or heavy lifting. If those duties are essential to their jobs, they can still request a temporary dispensation, according to the EEOC. Employers don\u2019t have to accommodate workers exactly as requested but they must offer reasonable alternatives. They cannot deny a request without clearing a high bar to prove doing so would cause \u201cundue hardships\u201d for the organization\u2019s finances or operations. They cannot force workers to take unpaid leave if a reasonable accommodation is available. The EEOC emphasizes that it \u201cshould not be complicated or difficult\u201d for pregnant workers to request accommodations. Workers don't have to make requests in writing, use specific words, cite any laws, or in most cases, provide documentation such as doctors' notes. Employers must respond quickly and have a conversation about how to reasonably accommodate a worker\u2019s needs. Still, legal experts advise both workers and employers to document the process. A Better Balance, the non-profit that spearheaded the 10-year campaign for the law's passage, advises workers to familiarize themselves with their legal rights and be as specific as possible about their limitations and the changes they they need. Workers who believe a request was denied illegally can file a complaint with the EEOC. They have 180 days to do so, though the deadline can be extended in some states. The EEOC included abortion among the conditions covered under the law. The rules state, however, that employers are not obligated to cover expenses related to the procedure or to offer health insurance that does. The EEOC regulations argue that including abortion is consistent with the agency's longstanding interpretation of other laws under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. But the decision drew condemnation from Republican lawmakers who had championed the law's passage. The five-member EEOC's two Republican members voted against the regulations. In a statement explaining her dissent, Commissioner Andrea Lucas said the agency broadened the scope of the law \u201cto reach virtually every condition, circumstance, or procedure that relates to any aspect of the female reproductive system\" in ways that \"cannot reasonably be reconciled with the text\" of the law. Melissa Losch, a labor and employment attorney at the New Orleans-based firm McGlinchey Stafford, said she expects the regulations to give rise to further litigation. Losch cited the example of a worker living in a state with a restrictive abortion law requesting time off to undergo the procedure in another state. The EEOC rules provide \u201cno good answer\u201d about whether granting such a request would conflict with restrictive state abortion laws, she added. On February 27, a federal judge blocked enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act for Texas state employees, a ruling that came in response to a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxton argued the law was unconstitutional because it was part of a spending bill that passed in the House without a majority of members present, and the judge ruled in his favor. Gedmark, of A Better Balance, said she was optimistic the Biden administration would prevail in its expected appeal of the ruling. In the meantime, federal and private sectors workers in Texas are covered by the law. But in her dissenting statement, Lucas warned that if the Texas case or any future lawsuits succeed in overturning the law, the EEOC's divisive rules have \u201call but extinguished\u201d the chances of a bipartisan effort to reenact it. Employers have been obligated to abide by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act since it took effect on June 27, 2023, though the EEOC regulations provided guidance on how to do so. The law swiftly made a difference to many low-wage workers, according to Gedmark. A Better Balance, which operates a helpline, has \u201cheard an overwhelmingly positive experience from workers,\u201d she said. Last summer, the organization worked with some women whose employers stopped resisting requests for accommodations as soon as the law took effect, Gedmark said. Some workers reported their employers were still operating under the old legal framework, handing them pages of disability paperwork to fill out in response to requests. The EEOC said it received almost 200 complaints alleging violations of the law by the time the fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, 2023. Gedmark said the success of the law will depend on enforcement and raising awareness. \u201cIf workers don\u2019t know about the law and don\u2019t know about their rights, then it really undermines the purpose of the law,\u201d she said. ____ The Associated Press\u2019 women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

By 2026, the AI industry alone is expected to consume at least ten times its energy demand from just three years prior, the IEA report found. Nvidia, a California-based firm that sells the majority of computer chips behind the AI boom, exemplifies this growth. Over three months ending in January, the company's revenue surged 265% compared to the same period a year prior, an earnings report showed. \"If Nvidia keeps growing in the way they're hoping they'll grow and keeps selling in the way they're planning to, that's a fairly large increase in energy usage,\" Arman Shehabi, a staff scientist in energy technologies at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told ABC News. In response to ABC News' request for comment, a Nvidia spokesperson said the company's products would reduce energy use in data centers, since Nvidia uses accelerated computing enabled by specialized hardware called a graphics processing unit, or GPU. \u201cReplacing conventional servers with GPU-accelerated systems will reduce, not increase, energy use in datacenters,\" the spokesperson said. \"For example, a single GPU-accelerated server can replace hundreds of conventional servers to accomplish the same workload. And our GPUs enable AI-enhanced systems that will be more energy efficient across all industries, including transportation, manufacturing, logistics, and energy, among others.\u201d In its fiscal year 2023 annual corporate responsibility report , the company highlighted what they said were AI-driven tools helping to address climate change, including carbon reduction and management.

Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images In addition, the shift to remote work caused as much as a 35% spike in demand for data-center usage during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tevfik Kosar, professor of computer science and engineering at the University at Buffalo, told ABC News. While the increased demand ebbed as many employees returned to work, the persistence of hybrid work arrangements has elevated such data-center demand above pre-pandemic levels, he added. \"That capacity increase didn't really go back to normal,\" Kosar said. In all, the electric power sector accounted for nearly a quarter of U.S. carbon emissions in 2022, making it the second-largest industry emitter behind transportation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says on its website. More than half of the nation's electricity came from fossil-fuel sources, including coal and natural gas, the EPA adds. The information technology sector \u2013 of which data centers make up a key part \u2013 accounts for about 3% of global carbon emissions, which matches the share of worldwide emissions produced by the aviation industry, Kosar said. \"That is not so small,\" he noted.

            "content": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine launched a barrage of drones across Russia overnight, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said Saturday, in attacks that appeared to target the country\u2019s energy infrastructure. Fifty drones were shot down by air defences over eight Russian regions, including 26 over the country\u2019s western Belgorod region close to the Ukrainian border. Two people \u2014 a woman with a broken leg and the man caring for her \u2014 died during the overnight barrage, after explosions sparked a blaze that set their home alight, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on social media. A pregnant woman and her unborn child were also killed in shelling later Saturday, he said. Drones were also reportedly destroyed over the Bryansk, Kursk, Tula, Smolensk, Ryazan and Kaluga regions across Russia\u2019s west and south, and in the Moscow region. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that it had shot down a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet. It provided no details and the claims couldn't be independently verified. Ukrainian officials normally decline to comment about attacks on Russian soil. However, many of the drone strikes appeared to be directed toward Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure. The head of the Kaluga region, Vladislav Shapsha, said that a drone strike had sparked a blaze at an electrical substation, while Bryansk Gov. Alexander Bogomaz and Smolensk Gov. Vasily Anokhin also reported fires at fuel and energy complexes. In recent months, Russian refineries and oil terminals have become priority targets of Ukrainian drone attacks, part of stepped-up assaults on Russian territory. Ukrainian drone developers have been extending the weapons\u2019 range for months, as Kyiv attempts to compensate for its battlefield disadvantage in weapons and troops. The unmanned aerial vehicles are also an affordable option while Ukraine waits for more U.S. military aid. Moscow said Friday evening that an American citizen known to have fought with Kremlin-backed separatists in Ukraine between 2014 and 2017 had died in the Russian-occupied Donetsk region. Russell Bentley, 64, was no longer involved in military operations and previously worked for state-owned Russian news agency Sputnik. His death was confirmed by his former battalion and by Margarita Simonyan, head of the state-funded television channel RT, who described him as \u201ca real American.\" He used the call sign \u201cTexas\u201d and had spent time in prison on charges of drug smuggling before leaving the United States. No information has been released as to the cause of Bentley\u2019s death, but local police had previously reported the American as missing on April 8. Meanwhile, Russia attacked Ukraine overnight with seven missiles, and air defences downed two missiles and three reconnaissance drones, the Ukrainian air force said Saturday. Gov. Oleh Kiper, head of Ukraine\u2019s Odesa region, said that ballistic missiles had damaged infrastructure overnight, but didn't provide further details. Previous attacks on the Black Sea city on Friday damaged port infrastructure, including two food export terminals, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Russian shelling also killed two men, including a 81-year-old retiree in the city of Vovchansk, said Gov. Oleh Syniehubov, head of Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region. A 60-year-old woman was wounded after shelling struck a nine-story apartment building, he said. A 54-year-old man was also killed in shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk region, local governor Serhii Lysak said. Alongside the attacks, Ukrainian police said they were hunting for two Ukrainian soldiers who killed a police officer at a checkpoint in the country\u2019s Vinnytsia region. The troops opened fire on Maksym Zaretskyi, 20, in the early hours of Saturday morning after he stopped their car for a routine inspection. Zaretskyi\u2019s partner was wounded, but survived the attack. In a statement on social media, Ukraine\u2019s Ground Forces Command confirmed that the two men were military personnel. They described Zaretskyi\u2019s death as an \u201cirreparable loss\u201d and said that those guilty of his killing should be \u201cpunished severely.\u201d \u201cGround Forces Command will provide all possible assistance in a comprehensive and impartial investigation,\u201d it said. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

            "title": "The drug war devastated Black and other minority communities. Is marijuana legalization helping?",
            "date": "2024-04-20 00:21:00",
            "content": "ARLINGTON, Wash. -- When Washington state opened some of the nation's first legal marijuana stores in 2014, Sam Ward Jr. was on electronic home detention in Spokane, where he had been indicted on federal drug charges. He would soon be off to prison to serve the lion's share of a four-year sentence. A decade later, Ward, who is Black, recently posed in a blue-and-gold throne used for photo ops at his new cannabis store, Cloud 9 Cannabis. He greeted customers walking in for early 4/20 deals. And he reflected on being one of the first beneficiaries of a Washington program to make the overwhelmingly white industry more accessible to people harmed by the war on drugs. \u201cIt feels great to know that I\u2019m the CEO of a store, with employees, people depending on me,\u201d Ward said. \u201cJust being a part of something makes you feel good.\u201d A major argument for legalizing the adult use of cannabis was to stop the harm caused by disproportionate enforcement of drug laws that sent millions of Black, Latino and other minority Americans to prison and perpetuated cycles of violence and poverty. Studies have shown that minorities were incarcerated at a higher rate than white people, despite similar rates of cannabis use. But efforts to help those most affected participate in \u2014 and profit from \u2014 the legal marijuana sector have been halting. Since 2012, when voters in Washington and Colorado approved the first ballot measures to legalize recreational marijuana, legal adult use has spread to 24 states and the District of Columbia. Nearly all have \u201csocial equity\u201d provisions designed to redress drug war damages. Those provisions include erasing criminal records for certain pot convictions, granting cannabis business licenses and financial help to people convicted of cannabis crimes, and directing marijuana tax revenues to communities that suffered. \u201cSocial equity programs are an attempt to reverse the damage that was done to Black and brown communities who are over-policed and disproportionately impacted,\u201d said Kaliko Castille, former president of the Minority Cannabis Business Association. States have varying ways of defining who can apply for social equity marijuana licenses, and they're not necessarily based on race. In Washington, an applicant must own more than half the business and meet other criteria, such as having lived for at least five years between 1980 and 2010 in an area with high poverty, unemployment or cannabis arrest rates; having been arrested for a cannabis-related crime; or having a below-median household income. Legal challenges over the permitting process in states like New York have slowed implementation. After settling other cases, New York \u2014 which has issued 60% of all cannabis licenses to social equity applicants, according to regulators \u2014 is facing another lawsuit. Last month, the libertarian-leaning Pacific Legal Foundation alleged it favors women- and minority-owned applicants in addition to those who can demonstrate harm from the drug war. \u201cIt's that type of blanket racial and gender preference that the Constitution prohibits,\u201d said Pacific Legal attorney David Hoffa. Elsewhere, deep-pocketed corporations that operate in multiple states have acquired social equity licenses, possibly frustrating the intent of the laws. Arizona lawmakers this year expressed concern that licensees had been pressured by predatory businesses into ceding control. Difficulty in finding locations due to local cannabis business bans or in obtaining bank loans due to continued federal prohibition has also prevented candidates from opening stores. In some cases, the very things that qualified them for licenses \u2014 living in poor neighborhoods, criminal records and lack of assets \u2014 have made it hard to secure the money needed to open cannabis businesses. The drafters of Washington's pioneering law were preoccupied with keeping the U.S. Justice Department from shutting down the market. They required background checks designed to keep criminals out. \u201cA lot of the early states, they simply didn\u2019t have social equity on their radar,\u201d said Jana Hrdinova, administrative director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center at Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law. Many states that legalized more recently \u2014 including Arizona, Connecticut, Ohio, Maryland and Missouri \u2014 have had social equity initiatives from the start. Washington established its program in 2020. But only in the past several months has it issued the first social equity retail licenses. Just two \u2014 including Ward's \u2014 have opened. Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board Member Ollie Garrett called the progress so far disappointing, but said officials are working with applicants and urging some cities to rescind zoning bans so social equity cannabis businesses can open. The state, which collects roughly half a billion dollars a year in marijuana tax revenue, is making $8 million available in grants to social equity licensees to help with expenses, such as security systems and renovations, as well as business coaching. It also is directing $250 million to communities harmed by the drug war \u2014 including housing assistance, small-business loans, job training and violence prevention programs. Ward's turnaround is one officials hope to see repeated. He started dealing marijuana in his teens, he said. In 2006, a customer pulled a gun on him, and Ward was shot in the hand. A single father of seven children, he continued dealing drugs to support them, he said, until he was indicted in 2014 \u2014 along with 30 other people \u2014 in an oxycodone distribution conspiracy. He served nearly three years in prison. Ward, now 39, spent that time taking classes, working out and training other inmates. He started a personal training business after he was released, got a restaurant job and joined a semipro football team, the Spokane Wolfpack. That's where he met Dennis Turner, a Black entrepreneur who briefly owned the team. Turner had worked as a restaurant manager on cruise ships, for the postal service and as a corrections officer before investing his savings \u2014 $6,000 \u2014 in a friend's medical marijuana growing operation. They used the proceeds to help open a medical dispensary in Cheney, a small college town southwest of Spokane, that eventually became an adult-use marijuana retailer. In Washington's social equity program, Turner saw an opportunity to make Ward a business executive. The two joined Rashel Palmer, whose husband co-owns the football team, in launching Cloud 9 at a cost of around $400,000. They picked Arlington, Washington \u2014 320 miles (515 kilometers) away \u2014 because it's a quickly growing city with limited cannabis competition, they said. Ward \u201csaw me as a guy that he looked up to, that did good business, was self-made and came out the trenches, and he just wanted to pick my brain,\u201d Turner said. Turner is working to open cannabis stores in New Mexico and Ohio through social equity programs in those states. He hopes one day to sell them for tens of millions of dollars. In the meantime, he intends to use his businesses to support local charities, such as the Boys and Girls Club in Arlington and the Carl Maxey Center, which provides services to the Black community in Spokane. Another new social equity licensee is David Penn Jr., 47, who helped persuade Pasco, in south-central Washington, to rescind its ban. Penn, who is Black, was arrested on a crack cocaine charge as a teenager. In 2011, he was kicked out of his apartment after a marijuana bust. A friend with two other cannabis outlets is financing Penn's store. His location, a dirt-floored building next to a gas station, still needs to be built out. State grants will help, but won't be enough. \u201cIt's like they're giving you the carriage, but you need the horses to get this thing going,\u201d Penn said.",

            "date": "2024-04-20 00:18:00",
            "content": "PHOENIX -- Special LP releases, live performances and at least one giant block party are scheduled around the U.S. Saturday as hundreds of shops celebrate Record Store Day during a surge of interest in vinyl and the day after the release of Taylor Swift's latest album. There were no announced Record Store Day specials for the arrival of Swift's \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d on Friday, but her fans always anxiously look forward to the new albums and accompanying collectible LPs. In suburban strip malls and big city downtowns, indie record stores are often the first to recognize and promote emerging artists. Years before Swift was setting Grammy records and selling out concerts in Japan, Bull Moose Music in Portland, Maine, was giving away one of her autographed guitars in an enter-to-win contest. \u201cWe were carrying her music before all the big stores. We always knew she would be a star,\u201d said Chris Brown of employee-owned Bull Moose and a co-founder of Record Store Day. A wave of interest in physical records, especially LPs, has helped keep the independent stores going, Brown said. And LPs have gotten a huge boost from Swift, who has been dubbed the \u201cVinyl Queen\u201d for releases of her work in limited physical record offerings with specialized content and striking covers. The Recording Industry Association of American said in its 2023 year end report that revenues from vinyl records grew 10% to $1.4 billion last year. That was the 17th consecutive year of growth and accounted for 71% of physical format revenues. Record Store Day is a celebration of the estimated 1,400 independent record stores in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide that endure long after the demise of megastores like Tower Records. While most people stream their music on services such as Spotify and Apple Music, old-school LPs remain popular for collectors who prefer the packaging and the listening experience of records. \u201cFor me, records sound better than any CD,\u201d said Michael Iffland, a 70-year-old retiree who was considering some Beatles singles at the Tracks in Wax record store in Phoenix. \u201cIt's just cool having a record in your hand, looking at the cover graphics and listening to that wonderful sound.\u201d Owners and employees of the independent stores came up with the idea at a gathering in 2007 as a way to draw attention to their unique culture on the third Saturday of April. The first Record Store Day was on April 19, 2008, and cities around the U.S. later declared the celebration an official holiday, including New York City, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. \u201cFor us, records have never gone out of style,\u201d said Waric Cameron, co-owner of Josey Records in Dallas. \u201cIt's the biggest day of the year for us,\u201d added his business partner, Luke Sardello. \u201cIt's like the Super Bowl of record stores.\u201d Jamal Alnasr, owner of Village Revival Records in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village, called Record Store Day \u201cone of my biggest money growers of the year. People even camp outside the night before.\u201d Record Store Day is typically marked by special vinyl and CD releases and various promotional products and events featuring artists and labels. Metallica spent hours on the first Record Store Day meeting fans at Rasputin Music in the San Francisco Bay area. Jesse \u201cBoots Electric\u201d Hughes of Eagles of Death Metal was declared a Record Store Day ambassador in 2009 and a string of other artists followed in subsequent years, including Ozzy Osbourne, Iggy Pop, Jack White, Fred Armisen, as well as Swift in 2022. There were 387 planned releases announced for this year's Record Store Day. Paramore, the event's 2024 ambassador, will have a pair of physical releases of the digital album that featured celebrity remixes from songs on its 2023 \u201cThis is Why\u201d album. Rock band Pearl Jam will release 15,000 copies of a \u201cDark Matter\u201d LP, with a ghostly black and yellow cover. Icelandic-American traditional pop singer Laufey will offer up 4,200 copies of \u201cA Night at the Symphony,\u201d a live album recorded in Reykjav\u00edk with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra. In some cases, the record itself will serve as a canvas. Death Cab for Cutie will release 2,500 copies of its \u201cLive at the Showbox\u201d on pink marble vinyl. Fleetwood Mac will have a limited edition of its hugely popular \u201cRumours,\u201d still a top seller since its 1977 release, with a photograph of the album cover featuring Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood stamped on the vinyl. \u201cPeople get really excited and look forward to the releases,\u201d said Tracks in Wax owner Tim Stamper, who always orders a few. \u201cIt's more important for us than Christmas.\u201d Jeff Maimon, 38, who was in the store on a visit from Chicago, said Record Store Day \u201cwas always a very special day. It's all about the excitement of standing outside and waiting in line to see what kind of specials you can get.\u201d A giant block party with 14 live performances is planned Saturday at Vinyl Tap in Nashville, Tennessee, owner Todd Hedrick said. The performers will include Lzzy and Joe of Halestorm and The Watson Twins. \u201cWe'll shut down the street, bring in five or six food trucks,\u201d along with about 25 vendors, Hedrick said. \u201cAnd it coincides with our other favorite holiday, 4/20,\u201d Hedrick added, referring to marijuana-oriented celebrations held annually on April 20. Swift, who is credited by fans and record stores alike with igniting new interest in vinyl LPs, has not announced any special releases for this Record Store Day. The hugely popular Swift set a new record this year when she won a fourth album of the year award at the Grammy Awards for \u201cMidnights.\u201d She previously had been tied with Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon with three albums. Swift\u2019s re-recorded \u201c1989 (Taylor's Version)\u201d last year became the first album to sell more than 1 million vinyl LPs within a calendar year in the U.S. Her \u201cMidnights\u201d album in 2022 became the first major album release to have its vinyl sales outpace CDs since 1987. ___ AP video journalist Kendria LaFleur in Dallas contributed reporting.",

            "content": "JACKSON, Miss. -- As a child, Dau Mabil escaped war-torn Sudan and built a new life in Mississippi. This month, fishermen found the body of the 33-year-old Mabil floating in a river, prompting calls for a federal investigation into his disappearance and death. Mabil, who lived in Jackson with his wife, went missing in broad daylight on March 25 after going for a walk on a trail connecting the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum with other city landmarks. His brother, Bul Mabil, cast doubt on initial autopsy results published Thursday, which a sheriff said did not uncover signs of foul play. Bul Mabil said he is dissatisfied with the way authorities have handled the case. \u201cI can't believe this would happen to someone who came here from a war-torn country,\u201d he said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201dI was expecting much better government in this country. But this is the way the United States operates. It is so appalling.\u201d Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, whose district includes Jackson, sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting a Justice Department investigation. Thompson said civil rights organizations had contacted his office about the case, and his letter described Mabil as an \u201cAfrican male, who is married to Mrs. Karissa Bowley, a white female.\u201d Family members and concerned citizens spent weeks searching for Dau Mabil, who was captured by a surveillance camera walking near the trail. In an interview, Bul Mabil said he raced to Jackson from his home in Houston on March 26 after hearing of his brother\u2019s death from a family friend. He said he began looking into the case on his own, alongside the Capitol Police, a state law enforcement agency that operates in part of Jackson. At the same time, Bowley led rallies and information campaigns on behalf of her missing husband, asking for the public's help to find him. She did not respond to a text or phone call seeking comment. Fishermen spotted a body on April 13 in the Pearl River in Lawrence County, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Jackson. Days later, officials confirmed the remains were those of Dau Mabil. Bul Mabil said his brother's death has been devastating for him and his mother, who still lives in a refugee camp. The brothers were among the thousands of young refugees brought to the U.S. during their country\u2019s bloody civil war. After they arrived, Julie Hines Mabus, the ex-wife of former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus, started a foundation that helped the children settle in Jackson. She described Dau Mabil as \u201csoft-spoken, a smile on his face, a little twinkle in his eye.\u201d \u201cTo get here was miraculous and then for Bul to get his brother here was even more miraculous,\u201d Hines Mabus told the AP. \u201cIt was sort of like a homecoming. And now for Bul to face this with his brother, it\u2019s just heartbreaking.\u201d Bul Mabil filed emergency legal papers to ensure his brother's body wouldn't be released to Bowley and her family until an autopsy was performed by both the state crime lab and an independent medical examiner. On Thursday, Hinds County Chancery Judge Dewayne Thomas granted the request, pausing release of the body and ordering a second autopsy. In a subsequent court filing, Bowley's attorney said her client \u201cembraces\u201d the judge's order for an additional autopsy, with the condition it be conducted only after all law enforcement entities finish investigating. Bul Mabil cast doubt on a statement from Lawrence County Sheriff Ryan Everett, who first reported the results of the initial autopsy Thursday. Everett said the autopsy did not reveal foul play, but an official determination may be made later, pending further testing. Bailey Martin, a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Safety, said the state crime lab performed the autopsy. The department expects to receive DNA confirmation next week. Bul Mabil's attorneys said they hope an independent autopsy can be done within the next week. Capitol Police conducted an \u201cinsufficient\u201d investigation, Bul Mabil said. One of this attorneys, Carlos Tanner, said his client was \u201cbeing left in the dark about the suspicious circumstances\u201d about his brother's disappearance and death. Vallena Greer, a Jackson woman who took in and raised Dau Mabil, said he thrived in America. He received a school award for his improved English speaking skills and was a talented soccer player. At the time of his disappearance, Dau Mabil worked as a manager at a Jackson restaurant and planned on returning to school to earn a computer science degree. \u201cHe did well for what America wants immigrants to be,\" Bul Mabil said. \u201cWe called Mississippi our second home. We didn\u2019t know something like this would happen to one of us.\u201d ___ Michael Goldberg is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The trial came eight years after 11 million leaked secret financial documents that became known as the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d prompted the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and brought scrutiny to the then-leaders of Argentina and Ukraine, Chinese politicians, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, among others. Judge Baloisa Marqu\u00ednez noted Friday that the case included more than 530 volumes of information. The public trial had been expected to run to the end of the month. The judge has 30 working days to issue a verdict. Those on trial include the owners of the Mossack Fonseca law firm that was at the heart of the 2016 massive document leak. J\u00fcrgen Mossack attended the trial, while his partner Ram\u00f3n Fonseca did not for health reasons, according to his counsel. Panamanian prosecutors allege that Mossack, Fonseca and their associates created a web of shell companies that used complex transactions to hide money linked to illicit activities in the \u201ccar wash\u201d corruption scandal of Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. \u201cThis whole process from eight years ago until now \u2026 has had a lot of consequences for my family, on my personal situation and truly has been a great injustice not just for me but for all of the people who have worked with me,\u201d Mossack testified Friday. \u201cI trust your honor will know how to evaluate all that has been said here.\u201d Mossack had said at the start of the trial, as he has for years, that he was not guilty of the money laundering charges. According to Panamanian prosecutors, the Mossack Fonseca firm created 44 shell companies, 31 of which opened accounts in Panama to hide money linked to the Brazilian scandal. Fonseca has said the firm, which closed in 2018, had no control over how its clients might use offshore vehicles created for them. Mossack Fonseca helped create and sell around 240,000 shell companies across four decades in business. It announced its closure in March 2018, two years after the scandal erupted. The firm's documents were first leaked to the German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung, and were shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which began publishing collaborative reports with news organizations in 2016. \u201cThe reputational deterioration, the media campaign, the financial siege and the irregular actions of some Panamanian authorities have caused irreparable damage, whose consequence is the complete cease of operations to the public,\u201d the firm said in a statement at the time. The Mossack and Fonseca were acquitted on other charges in 2022.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 23:01:00",
            "content": "In a seismic union election Friday evening, Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted to join the United Auto Workers Union. The workers voted 2,628 to 985 for union representation, according to a spokesperson for the National Labor Relations Board. \"There were seven challenged ballots that won\u2019t be counted, because they aren\u2019t determinative to the outcome of the election. There were three void ballots. The total number of eligible voters was 4,326,\" according to a statement from the NLRB. The employer will begin \"bargaining in good faith\" with the union, with parties having five days to file objections to the election. The vote to unionize has the potential to supercharge organizing in the nation's auto sector and demonstrate the strength of a resurgent labor movement through a victory in the South, a region typically resistant to unions. Workers began casting ballots this week in the most significant test for the UAW since a strike last fall against the Big 3 U.S. carmakers that delivered substantial gains and a burst of interest from employees at non-union firms. \"Workers in America are fed up with being left behind and unions are the path to dignity on and off the job,\" UAW president Shawn Fain said in February in a post on X , after having met with workers at the Volkswagen facility. MORE: Why the UAW vote at Volkswagen is significant for workers across US The labor agreements at the Big 3 last year prompted some non-union competitors to offer pay increases and other benefits, putting their employees in closer alignment with UAW members. Honda, Nissan and Tesla are among the companies that raised wages for U.S. employees after the UAW deal. The breakthrough also triggered a wave of UAW organizing, the union says. Over 10,000 non-union auto workers have signed cards in support of the UAW in recent months and organizing campaigns have broken out at more than two dozen facilities, the union said in a statement last month. The election at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga offered a difficult test, even as the union appears poised for growth. The UAW suffered narrow defeats in two elections at the facility over the past decade. Governors of six southern states, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, issued a joint statement this week criticizing the UAW and voicing general opposition toward unions. \"As Governors, we have a responsibility to our constituents to speak up when we see special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by,\" they wrote . In this file photo, signs stand outside a Volkswagen plant during a vote among local workers over whether or not to be represented by the United Auto Workers union in Chattanooga, TN, June 13, 2019. Nick Carey/Reuters/FILE For its part, Volkswagen has remained publicly neutral toward the union drive. In a statement, the company told ABC News that it supports the union election process.

Volkswagen is proud of our working environment in Chattanooga that provides some of the best paying jobs in the area,\" the company added A union victory would help bolster the UAW's membership, which has dropped steadily from a peak of 1.5 million workers in 1970 to 370,000 last year. MORE: Why is Trump's Truth Social stock plummeting? The opportunity for membership expansion at the UAW, just months after its high-profile strike against the Big 3, exemplifies a wider trend in the U.S. labor movement. More than 500,000 workers went out on strike nationwide in 2023, more than doubling the figure recorded a year earlier, according to Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations . The uptick in activity, however, failed to translate into union membership gains. Only 10% of U.S. workers belonged to unions last year, little changed from the year prior, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed. The election in Chattanooga will test whether the headline-grabbing labor strikes can translate into a resurgence of union growth, said Stephen Silvia, a professor at American University and the author of \"The UAW's Southern Gamble.\" \"Historically, unionization has proceeded in waves,\" Silvia said. \"Is this a wave? That's what we'll see.\"",

            "content": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Buffalo Bills owners Terry and Kim Pegula are exploring the possibility of selling a non-controlling, minority interest in the franchise, the team announced on Friday. A person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press the stake in the team the Pegulas would be preparing to sell would be about 25%. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because that detail was not announced by the team. It was first reported by The Athletic. The Bills announced the Pegulas have hired Allen & Company to oversee the process, while stressing no sale would take place without the Pegulas maintaining a controlling interest in the franchise. The Bills also announced the sale is limited only to the Bills, and not any of the Pegulas\u2019 other holdings, which include the NHL Buffalo Sabres, the American Hockey League Rochester Americans and National Lacrosse League franchises in Buffalo and Rochester. The prospect of selling shares of the Bills comes at a time the franchise is facing a cash crunch with rising construction costs of the team\u2019s new stadium being built across the street from its current facility, and scheduled to open in 2026. The initial cost of the stadium was pegged at $1.4 billion when a preliminary agreement was struck with the state and county in March 2022. That number jumped to $1.54 billion months later and was last projected to be approaching $1.7 billion in August. The Bills are responsible to cover any cost over-runs beyond $1.4 billion, according to terms of the agreement, which locked in the public share at $850 million. In August, Terry Pegula chose to have the Bills and Sabres operate as separate entities by dissolving their parent company, Pegula Sports and Entertainment, in what was called a move to streamline both operations. The sale of Bills' shares also comes at a time when speculation continues to rise over whether the Pegulas are interested in selling the Sabres. A second person with direct knowledge of the Pegulas' plans told the AP the Sabres are not for sale. The Pegulas, who made their fortune in the natural gas industry, have a reported net worth of $6.8 billion. They purchased the Bills for a then-NFL record $1.4 billion in 2014. Last year, Forbes listed the Bills as being valued at $3.7 billion. Kim Pegula has been unable to fulfill her duties while dealing with significant language and memory issues after going into cardiac arrest in June 2022. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

            "date": "2024-04-19 15:31:00",
            "content": "OMAHA, Neb. -- The Environmental Protection Agency cleared the way Friday for a higher blend of ethanol to be sold nationwide for the third summer in a row, citing global conflicts that it says are putting pressure on the world's fuel supply. The agency announced an emergency waiver that will exempt gasoline blended with 15% ethanol from an existing summertime ban. Gasoline with 10% ethanol is already sold nationwide, but the higher blend has been prohibited in the summer because of concerns it could worsen smog during warm weather. EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the waiver was warranted because of \u201cRussia\u2019s unjustified, unprovoked, and unconscionable war against Ukraine\u201d and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, which he said are putting pressure on the global fuel supply. He said the diminished U.S. refining capacity is also a factor. The biofuels industry and politicians in the Midwestern states where ethanol is produced from corn praised the EPA\u2019s decision. They have portrayed ethanol as a product that helps farmers, reduces prices at the pump and lessens greenhouse gases because the fuel burns more cleanly than gasoline. \u201cAllowing uninterrupted sales of E15 will help extend gasoline supplies, prevent fuel shortages, protect air quality and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d said Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds called the decision \u201ca huge victory for Iowa farmers, American energy independence, and consumers.\u201d Environmentalists and others, however, have said increased ethanol production can increase carbon releases because it results in more corn production, leading to increased use of fertilizer and greater releases of nitrate. Synthetic and natural fertilizers also are a leading source of water pollution. Iowa leads the nation in ethanol production, followed by Nebraska, Illinois, South Dakota, Minnesota and Indiana. Most gasoline sold across the country today is blended with 10% ethanol, though 15% blends are becoming increasingly common, especially in the Midwest. The EPA has approved sales of E15 for cars and trucks manufactured after 2000. The RFA estimates that the higher blend will cost consumers more than 25 cents a gallon less than 10% ethanol. Earlier this year, the EPA permanently approved year-round E15 sales in eight Midwestern states, starting next year. The waiver announced Friday is temporary and only applies this year.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 15:29:00",
            "content": "BALTIMORE -- Salvage crews at the site of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore are turning their focus to the thousands of tons of debris sitting atop the Dali, a massive cargo ship that veered off course and caused the deadly catastrophe last month. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tons of steel and concrete landed on the ship\u2019s deck after it crashed into one of the bridge\u2019s supporting columns and toppled the span, officials said at a news conference Friday. Crews will have to remove all that before refloating the stationary ship and guiding it back into the Port of Baltimore. Officials displayed overhead photos of the ship with an entire section of fallen roadway crushing its bow. So far, cranes have lifted about 120 containers from the Dali, with another 20 to go before workers can build a staging area and begin removing pieces of the mangled steel and crumbling concrete. The ship was laden with about 4,000 containers and headed for Sri Lanka when it lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore. Its owner recently initiated a process requiring owners of the cargo on board to cover some of the salvage costs. Six members of a roadwork crew plunged to their deaths in the collapse and two bodies remain unaccounted for. \u201cWe cannot forget a true and hurting fact,\u201d Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said during the news conference. \u201cThere are still two Marylanders lost and still waiting to be returned with their families for closure.\u201d As the salvage operations continue alongside federal and law enforcement investigations, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said getting the bridge rebuilt is an urgent priority. The 1.6 mile (2.6 kilometer) span connected working-class communities on either side of Baltimore\u2019s harbor, allowing steelworkers and longshoremen to easily traverse the Patapsco River without driving through downtown and providing a vital route for East Coast truckers. \u201cThis is not about nostalgia. This is about necessity,\u201d Moore said. \u201cYou cannot have a fully functioning Port of Baltimore if the Key Bridge is not there.\u201d Moore said he met with leaders in Congress from both parties in Washington on Thursday to talk about funding to rebuild the bridge. He said all of them seemed to understand its importance. \u201cI know we are going to get this moment right, because we\u2019re choosing to work together,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat was a strike to our nation\u2019s economy.\u201d President Joe Biden , who visited Baltimore in the aftermath of the collapse, also called on Congress to authorize the federal government to pay for 100% of the cleanup and reconstruction. That would require bipartisan support, and some hardline congressional Republicans have already suggested controversial demands to offset the funding. In the meantime, crews are also working to reopen the port\u2019s main channel, which has been blocked since the collapse. Using massive floating cranes, they\u2019ve carted away about 1,300 tons of steel and counting, without any injuries to workers in the process, officials said. The effort remains on track to open a temporary access channel that would allow most maritime traffic through the port to resume by the end of the month, restoring commerce to one of the East Coast\u2019s busiest maritime transit hubs. Until that happens, unemployed port workers and others are receiving financial assistance through a network of local, state and federal programs. \u201cThis is a community that was literally forged out of steel,\u201d said Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski, who grew up in suburban Dundalk, practically in the bridge\u2019s shadow. \u201cThat same steel resolve will help us meet this moment, reopen our port and rebuild the Key Bridge.\u201d ___ Associated Press reporter Brian Witte contributed to this report from Annapolis.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 15:28:00",
            "content": "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The U.S. Border Patrol is asserting its authority to seize cannabis shipments \u2014 including commercial, state-authorized supplies \u2014 as licensed cannabis providers file complaints that more than $300,000 worth of marijuana has been confiscated in recent months at highway checkpoints in southern New Mexico. New Mexico's Democratic governor says the disruptions prompted a discussion this week with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose impeachment charges were dismissed this week. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham says she voiced concerns that the scrutiny of cannabis companies appears to be greater in New Mexico than states with regulated markets that aren't along the U.S. border with Mexico. Authorized cannabis sales in New Mexico have exceeded $1 billion since regulation and taxation of the recreational market began two years ago. Yet cannabis transport drivers say they have been detained hours while supplies are seized at permanent Border Patrol checkpoints that filter inbound traffic for unauthorized migrants and illegal narcotics, typically located about 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the U.S. border. \u201cSecretary Mayorkas assured the governor that federal policies with respect to legalized cannabis have not changed,\u201d said Lujan Grisham spokesperson Michael Coleman in an email. \u201cRegardless, the governor and her administration are working on a strategy to protect New Mexico\u2019s cannabis industry.\u201d Managers at 10 cannabis businesses including transporters last week petitioned New Mexico's congressional delegation to broker free passage of shipments, noting that jobs and investments are at stake, and that several couriers have been sidelined for \u201csecondary inspection\u201d and fingerprinted at Border Patrol checkpoints. \u201cWe request that operators who have had product federally seized should be allowed to either get their product returned or be monetarily compensated for the losses they've sustained,\" the letter states. U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich said the Department of Homeland Security should be focused on urgent priorities that don't include cannabis suppliers that comply with state law. \u201cStopping the flow of illicit fentanyl into our country should be the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s focus at these checkpoints, not seizing cannabis that\u2019s being transported in compliance with state law,\" the senator said in a statement, referring to the parent agency for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. \"New Mexicans are depending on federal law enforcement to do everything they can to keep our communities safe. Our resources should be used to maximize residents\u2019 safety, not distract from it.\u201d A public statement Thursday from the U.S. Border Patrol sector overseeing New Mexico provided a reminder that cannabis is still a \u201cSchedule 1\u201d drug, a designation also assigned to heroin and LSD. \"Although medical and recreational marijuana may be legal in some U.S. States and Canada, the sale, possession, production and distribution of marijuana or the facilitation of the aforementioned remain illegal under U.S. federal law,\" the agency's statement said. \u201cConsequently, individuals violating the Controlled Substances Act encountered while crossing the border, arriving at a U.S. port of entry, or at a Border Patrol checkpoint may be deemed inadmissible and/or subject to, seizure, fines, and/or arrest.\" Matt Kennicott, an owner of Socorro-based High Maintenance, a cannabis business, said seizures by Border Patrol started in February without warning and create uncertainty about shipments that include samples for consumer-safety testing. He said cannabis producers in southernmost New Mexico rely on testing labs farther north, on the other side of Border Patrol checkpoints, to comply with safeguards against contaminants like mold or pesticides. \u201cIt's not a little confusing, it's a lot confusing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're trying to figure out where this directive came from.\u201d",

            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The man who will run United Nations climate talks this November views the negotiations as a key link in international efforts to curb global warming. The conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, must build on last year's successful agreement to transition away from fossil fuels, said Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan's environment minister who will serve as conference president of the talks known as COP29 this fall. And this fall's meeting must help pave the way for countries to come together in 2025 on beefed-up plans to clamp down on heat-trapping gases, Babayev said. Baku is the place to find common ground on how rich countries may provide financial help to poorer nations who generally don't contribute as much to warming but suffer more from climate change, Babayev said in a 30-minute interview with The Associated Press at the Azerbaijan embassy in Washington. \u201cWe need to consider any possible actions or activities to bring the parties to be closer to each other,\u201d Babayev said. \u201cWe consider Baku as a bridge between the developing and developed world.\u201d But it's a bridge under construction. Most past climate negotiations \u2014 called Conferences of the Parties or COPs \u2014 had years to plan. But because of the geopolitics of eastern Europe, world leaders couldn't agree far in advance where COP29 would be. That's critical because the host country holds the presidency and sets the agenda. Baku was chosen last December, with its selection part of the peace accord between warring Armenia and Azerbaijan. Babayev won't officially take charge of negotiations until Nov. 11 when COP29 opens in Baku. Successful climate talks often depend on months or years of work by president-designates such as Babayev traveling and working to forge the skeleton of agreements and alliances. \u201cWe had only 10 months for preparation,\u201d Babayev said. Azerbaijan only recently picked a venue, Baku's large Olympic stadium, to try to fit in the 85,000 or so people who come to these conferences. \u201cA lot of things, they're not clear now but I think within this year everything will be more or less clear.\u201d Babayev said his team is still gathering information, meeting people and making connections, but hasn't yet set specific goals for the conference. But there is one general goal: More financial help for the developing world to shift to cleaner energy systems, and to cope with the extra heat, floods, storms and droughts worsened by climate change. \u201cThe agenda is to invite all the donors to at least increase their contribution for developing countries,\u201d Babayev said. \u201cBecause with the climate change there we are daily faced with all these impacts.\u201d Babayev pointed outside this week to sunny and sticky Washington weather, which was 78 degrees (25.6 degrees Celsius) , or 8 degrees (4.4 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal. He said Baku had similar temperatures at the moment, also well above normal. Look at Dubai, which hosted last year's climate talks, and its devastating flooding this week, something Kazakhstan and other countries have also felt, he said. Babayev pointed to early February in Baku when it hit a record 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit), which smashed the old February high mark by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit: \u201cThat is not normal. It is not normal.\u201d Babayev, 56, was in Washington for the spring meetings of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other powerful financial institutions. He and his team were mostly gathering information. The United Nations climate secretary, Simon Stiell, last week called on those financial institutions to make dramatic changes, including debt relief for poor nations, to help fight warming and its impacts. But Babayev is eyeing another group: The private sector of banks, investments funds and the like. \u201cWe call on the private sector to be very active and responsible about this and to be ready to not delay with the offers, the proposals for climate finance,\u201d Babayev said. Like the current COP president, Sultan al-Jaber of Dubai, who is the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Babayev worked for many years in the state-owned oil company in Azerbaijan. Activists and academics have long blasted the influence of the oil industry \u2014 one of the major sources of heat-trapping gases \u2014 in these United Nations negotiations and that intensified last year when it was run by an oil man. But al Jaber and Babayev said their industry connections are more helpful in getting companies to the table and getting things done. Babayev said he also hopes that Baku \u2014 where the world's first oil fields were developed in 1846 and Azerbaijan led the world in oil production in 1899 \u2014 can show how this \u201coil and gas country of the past\u201d can show the world a green path with its efforts to ramp up renewable energy, especially wind power. But in the past 10 years, Azerbaijan has increased its emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels by 13%, according to data from scientists at the Global Carbon Project. ___ Read more of AP\u2019s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "date": "2024-04-19 10:03:00",
            "content": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. -- Employees at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, overwhelmingly voted to join the United Auto Workers union Friday in a historic first test of the UAW\u2019s renewed effort to organize nonunion factories. The union wound up getting 2,628 votes, or 73% of the ballots cast, compared with only 985 who voted no in an election run by the National Labor Relations Board. Both sides have five business days to file objections to the election, the NLRB said. If there are none, the election will be certified and VW and the union must \u201cbegin bargaining in good faith.\u201d President Joe Biden, who backed the UAW and won its endorsement, said the union's win follows major union gains across the country including actors, port workers, Teamsters members, writers and health care workers. \u201cTogether, these union wins have helped raise wages and demonstrate once again that the middle-class built America and that unions are still building and expanding the middle class for all workers,\u201d he said in a statement late Friday. Twice in recent years, workers at the Chattanooga plant have rejected union membership in plantwide votes. Most recently, they handed the UAW a narrow defeat in 2019 as federal prosecutors were breaking up a bribery-and-embezzlement scandal at the union. But this time, they voted convincingly for the UAW, which is operating under new leadership directly elected by members for the first time and basking in a successful confrontation with Detroit\u2019s major automakers. The union\u2019s pugnacious new president, Shawn Fain, was elected on a platform of cleaning up after the scandal and turning more confrontational with automakers. An emboldened Fain, backed by Biden, led the union in a series of strikes last fall against Detroit\u2019s automakers that resulted in lucrative new contracts. The new contracts raised union wages by a substantial one-third, arming Fain and his organizers with enticing new offers to present to workers at Volkswagen and other companies. Next up for a union vote are workers at Mercedes factories near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, who will vote on UAW representation in May. Fain said he was not surprised by the size of the union's win Friday after the two previous losses. \u201cI think it's the reality of where we are and the times that we're in,\u201d he said Friday night. \u201cWorkers are fed up in being left behind.\u201d The win, he said, will help the growing unionization effort in the rest of the country. \u201cThis gives workers everywhere else the indication that it's OK,\u201d Fain said. \u201cAll we've heard for years is we can't win here, you can't do this in the South, and you can.\u201d Worker Vicky Holloway of Chattanooga was among dozens of cheering workers celebrating at an electrical workers union hall near the VW plant. She said the overwhelming vote for the union came this time because her colleagues realized they could have better benefits and a voice in the workplace. \u201cRight now we have no say,\u201d said Holloway, who has worked at the plant for 13 years and was there for the union's previous losses. \u201cIt\u2019s like our opinions don\u2019t matter.\u201d In a statement, Volkswagen thanked workers for voting and said 83.5% of the 4,300 production workers cast ballots in the election. Six Southern governors, including Tennessee\u2019s Bill Lee, warned the workers in a joint statement this week that joining the UAW could cost them their jobs and threaten the region\u2019s economic progress. But the overwhelming win is a warning to nonunion manufacturers, said Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who studies the union. \u201cThis is going to send a powerful message to all of those companies that the UAW is knocking at the door, and if they want to remain nonunion, they\u2019ve got to step up their game,\u201d Masters said. He expects other nonunion automakers to become more aggressive at the plants, and that anti-union politicians will step up their efforts to fight the union. Shortly after the Detroit contracts were ratified, Volkswagen and other nonunion companies handed their workers big pay raises. Last fall, Volkswagen raised production worker pay by 11%, lifting top base wages to $32.40 per hour, or just over $67,000 per year. VW said its pay exceeds the median household income for the Chattanooga area, which was $54,480 last May, according to the U.S. Labor Department. But under the UAW contracts, top production workers at GM, for instance, now earn $36 an hour, or about $75,000 a year excluding benefits and profit sharing. By the end of the contract in 2028, top-scale GM workers would make over $89,000. The VW plant will be the first the UAW has represented at a foreign-owned automaking plant in the South. It will not, however, be the first union auto assembly plant in the South. The UAW represents workers at two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky and two GM factories in Tennessee and Texas, as well as some heavy-truck manufacturing plants. Also, more than three decades ago, the UAW was at a Volkswagen factory in New Stanton, Pennsylvania, east of Pittsburgh. VW closed the plant that made small cars in the late 1980s. ___ Krisher reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalist Chris Megerian contributed from Washington.",

The apps were removed from the store on Friday after Chinese officials cited unspecified national security concerns. Their removal comes amid elevated tensions between the U.S. and China over trade, technology and national security. The U.S. has threatened to ban TikTok over national security concerns. But while TikTok, owned by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, is used by millions in the U.S., apps like WhatsApp and Threads are not commonly used in China. Instead, the messaging app WeChat, owned by Chinese company Tencent, reigns supreme. Other Meta apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger remained available for download, although use of such foreign apps is blocked in China due to its \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d network of filters that restrict use of foreign websites such as Google and Facebook. \u201cThe Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,\u201d Apple said. A spokesman for Meta referred to \u201cApple for comment.\u201d Apple, previously the world\u2019s top smartphone maker, recently lost the top spot to Korean rival Samsung Electronics. The U.S. firm has run into headwinds in China, one of its top three markets, with sales slumping after Chinese government agencies and employees of state-owned companies were ordered not to bring Apple devices to work. Apple has been diversifying its manufacturing bases outside China. Its CEO Tim Cook has been visiting Southeast Asia this week, traveling to Hanoi and Jakarta before wrapping up his travels in Singapore. On Friday he met with Singapore\u2019s deputy prime minister, Lawrence Wong, where they \u201cdiscussed the partnership between Singapore and Apple, and Apple\u2019s continued commitment to doing business in Singapore.\u201d Apple pledged to invest over $250 million to expand its campus in the city-state. Earlier this week, Cook met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, pledging to increase spending on Vietnamese suppliers. He also met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Cook later told reporters that they talked about Widodo's desire to promote manufacturing in Indonesia, and said that this was something that Apple would \u201clook at\".",

            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration on Friday imposed sanctions on two entities accused of fundraising for extremist Israel settlers already sanctioned, as well as the founder of an organization whose members regularly assault Palestinians. The Treasury Department announcement comes as the West Bank has seen some of its worst violence perpetrated by extremist settlers against Palestinians since the war in nearby Gaza began. There is also friction between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose far-right government has reacted angrily to previous sanctions imposed against West Bank settlers. Included in the Friday sanctions are two entities \u2014 Mount Hebron Fund and Shlom Asiraich \u2014 accused of raising funds for sanctioned settlers Yinon Levi and David Chai Chasdai. Both men were previously sanctioned by the Biden administration for violently attacking Palestinians in the West Bank. The penalties aim to block them from using the U.S. financial system and bar American citizens from dealing with them. The fundraising campaign established by Mount Hebron Fund for Levi and by Shlom Asiraich for Chasdai generated the equivalent of $140,000 and $31,000, respectively, according to U.S. Treasury. In Levi's case, the fund now sanctioned by the Biden administration is linked to the regional council in the area, a body that receives state money. The Biden order Friday stopped short of sanctioning the council itself. Rights groups say that the expansion of illegal settler outposts in the West Bank is enthusiastically supported by the regional councils and nudged along by Israel\u2019s current national government \u2014 the most far-right in the country\u2019s history. The Biden order also skirted sanctioning crowdfunding websites where funds were raised, GiveChak and New York-based Charidy. In Chasdai's case, the fundraiser on Charidy was organized by Shlom Asiraich, which raises money for imprisoned Jewish extremists. Both online fundraisers have now been taken down. But at least one fundraiser linked to a settler previously sanctioned by the Biden administration, Moshe Sharvit, remains online. As of Friday, the page on GiveChak had raised the equivalent of over $879,000. Additionally, the State Department is designating Ben-Zion Gopstein, the founder and leader of Lehava, an organization whose members have assaulted Palestinian civilians. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the organizations \"undermine the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank. We will continue to use our tools to hold those responsible accountable.\u201d In February, Biden issued an executive order that targets Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been accused of attacking Palestinians and Israeli peace activists in the occupied territory.",

            "content": "PARIS -- The French government announced a new rule on Friday that will require stores to tell customers when a product becomes smaller but its price stays the same or increases, a practice known as \u2018\u2019 shrinkflation. '' Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced the measure to tackle the common but often criticized method, which has become an international buzzword. He said that from July 1, such cases will need to be clearly communicated to shoppers. Le Maire called shrinkflation a \u201cscam\u201d and stressed the importance of transparency. \u201cConsumers must understand the real price evolution of products when their sizes change,\u201d he said in a statement. Retailers at medium to large supermarkets will have to display specific information about the price per unit and any changes in quantity next to the affected products. It must be visible as signs on store shelves for two months following any changes to a product. This requirement applies to a wide range of goods, including food and household items. The Finance Ministry said there would be exceptions for unpackaged food items and bulk goods. The French government is highlighting the new rule\u2019s consumer protection aspect. Consumers who notice pricing discrepancies are now encouraged to report them through France \u2019s SignalConso website or app. Consumer watchdogs welcomed the new rule. \u201cThis is great news, as shrinkflation is shifty and misleading because it is done behind the customer's back. It\u2019s high time to act, as we have less money and prices are rising,\u201d said Camille Dorioz, campaign director at Foodwatch France. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps very French that the government is stepping in to help the consumer. It\u2019s a French way not to let the markets rule on this problem,\u201d he added, saying that France is simply reinforcing a European law that forbids misleading packaging and products. Dorioz said that most shoppers don\u2019t notice when a product they buy is 2 grams less, but \u201cover time, it soon adds up, and when people are alerted to it, they understandably get angry.\u201d Retailers are less excited about the new rules, saying they'll be hard to implement and that the burden should be placed on manufacturers instead. Dominique Schelcher, head of supermarket chain Systeme U, said in a post on X that shrinkflation should be tackled, but added: \u2018\u2019Why ask retailers to do this and not demand it of manufacturers, who ... have all the necessary data?\" The issue has also come up in the U.S. presidential campaign.

Click here to submit your problem online . Letters are edited for length and clarity. Dear Sahib: First, one thing you left out of your letter: You\u2019re a high school student! You were dealing with trying to fix the car (seven times!), plus researching your state\u2019s Lemon Law and staying on top of your case \u2013 all while keeping up with homework, applying for college and playing on your school\u2019s tennis team. That\u2019s a lot to handle. You had done so much work and were so organized, the ABC News Fixer was more than happy to give this a little push over the finish line. You told us the first sign of trouble came one day as you drove on the highway about six months after getting the car. As you approached your exit, the shifter lost power and the \u201ccheck engine\u201d light came on. The car stalled, but luckily you were already at the ramp, so you coasted down and rolled to a stop. The car was stuck in neutral and you couldn\u2019t turn it off because the shifter wouldn\u2019t shift into park. After some stressful attempts, you finally got the car into park and turned it off. Later, when the dealership looked at it, they couldn\u2019t find the cause. You kept driving \u2013 and it happened again. And again. When you hit a pothole\u2026when you stopped in a fast-food drive-thru. You took it in seven times at two different dealerships, but the problem kept happening.Luckily, you kept good records. And you looked into the California Lemon Law, which protects consumers who have persistent problems with new vehicles. Your dad filed the case with the manufacturer \u2013 his name was on the sales contract \u2013 but you took charge of the phone calls. That became your new hobby, calling the manufacturer to try to get an update on your case. You told The Fixer you think many consumers would have gotten tired and given up after six months of repair attempts at two different dealerships and another two months of dealing with the manufacturer. But you kept at it. We reviewed your documents and got in touch with Fiat Chrysler , which owns the Dodge brand, asking about the delay. Shortly after, you got some good news \u2013 they were offering your choice of a replacement vehicle or the monetary value of your car. You opted for the money. We asked Fiat Chrysler about the long wait, and a company spokesman said that\u2019s just the way it is \u2014 it\u2019s a complex process, with the title needing to clear from owner to manufacturer. The company said that in the end, they were glad they could take care of this \u201cin the interest of customer satisfaction.\u201d You were smart to stay organized and keep good records of all the problems you had with the car. Lemon laws vary from state to state, but are generally for new cars that have persistent, substantial issues. In your home state of California, a car is a lemon if, within 18 months or 18,000 miles, there have been two or more attempts to repair a serious problem that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury, or four or more attempts to repair the same issue, or if the car has been in the shop for more than 30 days. Here are some more tips for success in a Lemon Law case:\u2022 Act quickly. Check the deadline to file in your state. You don\u2019t want to lose out because you waited too long to file. And be sure to contact the manufacturer, not the dealer, to file your lemon case.\u2022 Keep excellent records. Write down the purpose and date of each repair and note how long your car was in the shop each time.\u2022 If you win, you will get a replacement vehicle, or the cash value minus the mileage. \u2022 Don\u2019t expect to get reimbursement for after-market items. If you lose your case, you can still go to court. Note: Lemon laws don\u2019t apply to used cars. That\u2019s why used car buyers need to be especially careful. Here are some great tips on buying a used car . And if you\u2019re wondering where lemons end up, they can be repaired and resold, but their registration must disclose that they were once a \u201clemon buy-back\u201d vehicle. -The ABC News Fixer Do you have a consumer problem?

            "date": "2024-04-21 06:23:00",
            "content": "After much public debate, a Maine law has brought the country closer to having the popular vote determine the winner of national presidential elections -- but it's unlikely that will happen before November or even at all. Earlier this week, Maine Gov. Janet Mills allowed a bill to become law without her signature that would take effect once the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is able to gather pledges for at least 270 electoral votes -- the number of delegate votes needed to elect a president. The movement has now gathered pledges from 17 states and Washington, D.C. -- accounting for a total of 209 electoral votes. MORE: It's really hard to change Electoral College rules The movement seeks to change the way a president is chosen, without a constitutional amendment, but experts say it's unclear what happens when enough states have signed on. It's unlikely this would happen before the 2024 election. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact seeks to guarantee that the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia wins the presidency. When there are enough states pledging their popular votes to meet the 270 Electoral College vote threshold, all the votes in those states will be added up to a national count that determines the winner of the election. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact says that will give each vote equal weight regardless of where a voter lives. Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills delivers her State of the State address, Jan. 30, 2024, at the State House in Augusta, Maine. Robert F. Bukaty/AP Five of the 46 presidents who came into office lost the popular vote, including Donald Trump most recently in 2016. The compact argues that not every vote is equal under the current system. \"Under the current system, a small number of votes in a small number of states regularly decides the Presidency. All-or-nothing payoffs fuel doubt, controversy over real or imagined irregularities, hair-splitting post-election litigation, and unrest,\" the compact says on its website. \"In 2020, if 21,461 voters had changed their minds, Joe Biden would have been defeated, despite leading by over 7 million votes nationally. \u00a0Each of these 21,461 voters (5,229 in Arizona, 5,890 in Georgia, and 10,342 in Wisconsin) was 329 times more important than the 7 million voters elsewhere,\" the compact says. One expert says that everything that has to do with the Electoral College is controversial these days with a partisan divide on the issue. Many Democrats want to get rid of it, while more Republicans support it. \"If you look at all the presidential elections from 1992 through 2020, Republicans have won the presidential popular vote only once -- and that was in 2004 when [George W.] Bush beat John Kerry in the popular vote. In every other election over the last 30 years, Democrats have won the popular vote, but because of the Electoral College, Republicans have gotten the presidency a couple of times despite losing the popular vote,\" Darrell West, a Douglas Dillon chair in governmental studies at the Brookings Institute, told ABC News in an interview. MORE: Does it matter that Democrats are raising more money than Republicans? \"Republicans feel the Electoral College advantages them now and so they don't want to get rid of it,\" West said. West said the country currently only has a handful of swing states because of the Electoral College, so candidates spend most of their money on that small number of states. \"If we got rid of the Electoral College, candidates actually would campaign more broadly. They would visit more states because a vote in Illinois is the same as a vote in California,\" West said. Could this work? Experts say the most direct way to change how presidents are elected is to amend the U.S. Constitution, but there doesn't currently seem to be a feasible pathway without a consensus between both parties. \"Ultimately, there probably is going to have to be a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Electoral College, but everyone knows that's not possible now for political reasons. It takes a very large majority in Congress as well as in the states to make any change to the Constitution. So what states are trying to figure out is, 'Short of a constitutional amendment, are there ways to improve the Electoral College?'\" West said. A voter casts her ballot at a polling station in New York, April 2, 2024. Li Rui/Xinhua via Getty Images But it remains unclear what happens when enough states pledge their delegates. \"There's a lot of deep legal contestation over what happens next. I mean, in my judgment, I think it needs congressional consent,\" Derek Muller, a law professor at Notre Dame Law School, told ABC News. \"If Congress fails to do that, I'm sure there will be litigation,\" Muller said. MORE: Israel's war in Gaza became a political flashpoint. Will it risk Biden's coalition for reelection? There are other legal questions, such as whether it would violate equal protections if the U.S. were to have different states with different rules for their elections and questions about whether a state has the authority to do this, Muller said. \"There are lots of open, contested questions ... where I think the national popular vote, if it does hit 270, will immediately face a series of legal challenges,\" Muller said. West agreed that the legal situation is unclear. \"It's not obvious what the status would be of these laws. States do have the authority to set election laws. But according to the Constitution, the electors to the Electoral College actually are free to vote the way they want,\" West said. \"And so states can pass laws, but there haven't been a lot of cases testing these provisions. And so it's not clear how the Supreme Court would rule on this issue,\" West added. Muller said if a state sues another state, that case would go directly before the U.S. Supreme Court. \"It's really unclear who would bring the challenge or where they would bring it. One of the more interesting wrinkles is that there is the possibility, when you're dealing with a compact, you file directly in the United States Supreme Court so that could be a place where it goes. But again, I think there's a lot of possibilities about the litigation strategy if it does hit 270 [pledges],\" Muller said. Has something like this happened before? About 100 years ago, before the 17th Amendment was passed -- which allows for the direct election of senators -- states had begun shifting from legislatures choosing members sent by the state to the U.S. Senate to having \"preference polls\" for the public where they would signal who they wanted to represent the state. MORE: What are the states that could vote on abortion or reproductive rights in November? \"Some states -- I think Oregon was one of the leaders among some others -- would institute preference polls for the people for their senators. So they would hold an election that wasn't binding, but it would just request, 'Who do you want us to vote for?' And then you got a sentiment from the people and the legislature could or could not follow that,\" Muller said. Later, those states -- including Oregon -- began binding themselves to the results of the preference polls, Muller said. He pointed to this as an analogy in which the states were trying to \"convert legislative elections into a popular vote, even though there was no formal mechanism to do so.\" An exterior view of The White House on January 19, 2021 in Washington, DC. Eric Thayer/Getty Images Eventually, the Constitution was amended to make Senate seats elected by popular vote. West argues that the direct election of senators did require the constitutional amendment to go into effect. \"And that was 100 years ago, when the political times were less polarized than what we have today,\" West said. MORE: Nikki Haley's next move is going to a think tank after becoming major Trump critic Some states unsuccessfully tried to implement term limits for members of Congress about 20 or 30 years ago, Muller said. The Supreme Court said that was unconstitutional in 1995. \"So Missouri tried something a little more creative, which was to say, 'OK, we're going to ask all candidates to take a term-limits pledge, and we're gonna print if they violated their pledge, we're gonna put that on the ballot, or if they declined to support the term-limits pledge ... we're gonna print that on the ballot,'\" Muller said. \"The goal was to say, 'Well, we're not keeping you off the ballot, we're just telling everyone whether or not you're adhering to term limits,'\" Muller said. \"And the Supreme Court said, 'Well you can't do that either.'\"",

            "content": "Before any jurors were seated in Donald Trump 's historic criminal trial in New York , defense lawyers seeking to whittle down the pool of prospects asked them a vital question: What do you think of the former president? \"We all know that every one of you knows President Trump,\" defense attorney Todd Blanche told the potential jurors last week. \"You're not going to offend me, you're not going to offend the Court, the People, or even President Trump by really talking about your opinion of President Trump.\" As Trump sat feet away, sandwiched by his lawyers at counsel table, some of the jurors provided frank -- and at times scathing -- reviews of the former president's character and presidency. MORE: Who are the 12 jurors in Trump's historic criminal trial \"He just seems very selfish and self serving, so I don't really appreciate that in any public servant,\" said one prospective juror, a product development manager originally from California. Other prospective jurors offered a more flattering view. \"President Trump speaks his mind. I would rather that in a person than someone who's in office and you don't know what they're doing behind the scenes,\" said a middle school teacher from Harlem. \"Being in my generation during that candidacy, there was a divide in the country; I can't ignore that,\" she said. In this courtroom sketch, former President Donald Trump far right, turns around and looks at prospective jurors who raised their hands requesting to be excused from the jury panel in Manhattan Criminal Court, April 18, 2024, in New York. Elizabeth Williams/Pool via Reuters \"However,\" she said, \"I never equated that to one individual.\" Both prospects were ultimately selected for the 12-person jury, with the product manager becoming Juror No. 11 and the teacher becoming Juror No. 5. Opinions about the former president, to the extent that jurors have them, are not supposed to matter during the trial. Each of the jurors vowed to put any opinions of the former president aside when examining the evidence of the case and deciding Trump's guilt. But attorneys on both sides acknowledged that few people live in an information vacuum. \"Even if you want to be fair, and I believe that everybody who is sitting up here wants to be fair, we are asking you to probe yourself,\" defense attorney Susan Necheles asked the potential jurors. \"Would the way that you view him infect the way that you look at the evidence and evaluate the evidence in this case?\" \"I would say that I think that Trump and I probably have different beliefs, but I don't think that that invalidates anything about who he is as a person. This is a free country,\" said a software engineer who became Juror No. 6. \"I think that I can look at this as a person on trial, any other American citizen, and not take this person who used to be the president as that, and just stick to what's being shown to me.\" Related Stories Breyer says politics don't play a role at SCOTUS Apr 21, 12:20 PM Hearing to be held on Trump's bond in fraud case Apr 22, 3:41 AM Suspect arrested after break-in at LA Mayor's home Apr 22, 12:42 AM A civil litigator originally from North Carolina similarly told the lawyers in the case that he could put aside his conflicting thoughts on Trump to sit in judgment of the former president.

A speech therapist who grew up in New Jersey and now lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side had a similar attitude. \"I don't agree with a lot of his politics and his decisions as a president, but I have really taken the past two days to reflect and make sure that I could leave that at the door and be a totally impartial juror, and I feel like I can,\" said the woman, who was sworn in as Juror No. 9. A physical therapist from Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side similarly suggested she could put aside political opinions in the courtroom. \"As an eligible voter I feel it is my responsibility in regard to elections to establish an educated decision so that I can vote.

            "title": "Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal solar power grants",
            "date": "2024-04-22 05:05:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program. The grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials. Biden's latest environment al announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Senior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said. Solar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid. But solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans \u2014 and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election -year politics. Forty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Biden is making the announcement at northern Virginia\u2019s Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression. Biden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions. Biden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm. He has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector. Biden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how \"a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,\u201d said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi. He said the programs can \"unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.\u201d The awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion \u201cgreen bank\u201d created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change. EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was \u201clooking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.\u201d Among those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina. The taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank\u2019s funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers. ___ St. John reported from Detroit. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

            "content": "ABC News is taking a look at solutions for issues related to climate change and the environment with the series, \"The Power of Us: People, The Climate, and Our Future.\" Near the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Taos, New Mexico, a community built into the earth is living totally off-the-grid in mostly-recycled structures called Earthships. ABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee along with her team, Dan Manzo and Lindsey Griswold, traveled to Taos to stay with the community and find out what everyone can be doing to live a bit more sustainably. \"Everybody on the planet can wake up in the morning and be comfortable without fossil fuel. Everybody can grow food in their house, everybody can have electricity from the sun and wind,\" Michael Reynolds, founder and creator of Earthship Biotecture , told Zee. \"These buildings do that.\" Heating, cooling and powering buildings creates more greenhouse gas emissions than anything else in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, construction and demolition create more than 500 million tons of debris each year in this country alone, the EPA said. MORE: How the UN Plastics Treaty aims to tackle the pollution crisis The community of over 100 Earthships in Taos is made of \"living vessels\" with gravel, old tires, concrete and other discarded materials like glass bottles. Earthships are fully self-sustaining structures with timers for wifi and hot water use, according to Earthship Biotecture. Reynolds said he uses rainwater four times over for different purposes in his home. Michael Reynolds talks with ABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee outside Taos, New Mexico. ABC News \"I'm using five gallons \u2014 or three gallons of water to take a shower. That same three gallons of water waters my banana trees and my tomatoes,\" Reynolds said. \"That same three gallons of water is recollected to flush the toilet.\" Solar energy provides the homes with power, but it's not used to heat or cool the structures. Earthships use trash as insulation to keep them comfortable inside. Reynolds showed ABC News how Earthships are insulated with old tires filled with dirt. \"Each tire gets about four or five wheelbarrows of dirt pounded into them. So they're basically like steel encased Adobe bricks,\" Earthship Biotecture rental manager Hillary Hess told ABC News. \"And the sun comes in and it hits that mass. And then the tire retains it. And as the temperature in here would drop, that heat would be released.\" \"You know, on a cold February night, you walk in one of these and you go, 'This is amazing.'\" Reynolds said. \"This is warm and it's freezing outside and there's no heating system here. So if you've put people in a position to be able to experience it, then that's huge.\" An ABC News team stayed in one of the structures in Taos for three days to understand how they work and what it feels like to live in one. Hess said structure the team would be staying in is 5,400 square feet. Two thousand square feet of that is dedicated growing space. Outside Taos, New Mexico, a community of Earthships offers off-the-grid living claiming to be the answer to building sustainability. ABC News \"In this house there's two ponds in the greenhouse and we have tilapia out there,\" she said. \"So ideally, if you lived in this home, if you wanted, you could even be harvesting your own fish, chickens with eggs. And then you could catch a fish, pick your citrus, wrap it in a bag and leave and grill it out on the fire.\" Related Stories Biden announcing $7B in federal solar power grants Apr 22, 5:05 AM The EPA is again allowing summer sales of higher ethanol gasoline blend, citing global conflicts Apr 19, 3:31 PM EPA calls 2 forever chemicals hazardous substances Apr 19, 8:45 AM The small percentage of people living in Earthships aren't the only ones saying traditional living and building arrangements need to change. \"The building industry currently is known to account for approximately 40% of greenhouse gas emissions,\" Lola Ben-Alon, assistant professor at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation told ABC News. \"It's a really huge chunk of our industry in the world.\" MORE: Video The eco-friendly changes you can make that could also save you money Ben-Alon said there's no one answer as to what makes up the most sustainable home. \"There's no one solution,\" she said. \"It's really a combination of principles and a combination of design thinking with the local environment and what is available and what is the climatic context, but also the material availability context and the labor context.\" Reynolds believes the principles of Earthships can be applied everywhere. \"Not everybody's going to have an Earthship tomorrow,\" Zee said. \"If there had to be one thing from Earthships that we could apply to homes across America, what would be the most important? News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee sits with Earthship Biotecture founder and creator Michael Reynolds outside of an Earthship near Taos, New Mexico. ABC News \"I think it starts with comfort,\" Reynolds replied. \"In other words, you can add a greenhouse on the south side of your house, and that will hit those rooms that are near that. You can even in New York City, you can get an apartment with south facing windows. You can become aware of the fact that heat comes from that thing, and you can catch that heat.\" In Santa Fe New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham talked with ABC News about Earthships and other sustainability efforts in the state \"How important is it to experiment with sustainability like that?\" Zee asked. \"Because that's extreme.\" \"I think all of that has incredible value,\" Grisham said. \"It is not the No. 1 investment in sustainable living, but it is really powerful.\" \"Just their water reuse and recycling in its last place, after using it four times, is to grow food. I mean, these are particularly for states in the Southwest arid states,\" she added. \"That innovation and knowing that you can live completely off the grid and have sustainable building materials all recycled, we can do more of that.\" For his part, Reynolds said the extremity is necessary. \"I used to try to tone it down because I know that I'm a fanatic about it, and I can't expect other people to understand what I've been thinking about for decades,\" he said. \"So I try to water it down and tone it down, but now it's like, 'yeah, it's not appropriate to tone it down.' I mean, the solutions are the way forward on this planet. It's going to have to be extreme.\"",

To make a united step forward, awareness of the mounting climate crisis is vital, Dr. Virginia Burkett, chief scientist for Climate and Land Use Change at the U.S. Geological Survey told ABC News ahead of Earth Day. Planet Earth is seen in this GOES 12 satellite image taken on March 16, 2010 6:45 AM EDT. NOAA/NASA GOES Project \"The global Earth observations community has characterized a triple planetary crisis of interconnecting stressors: climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution,\" Burkett said, adding land degradation and deforestation to the list of great concern. \"Collectively, the interconnected effects of human activity pose significant challenges for human security and sustainable development,\" Burkett warned. Unnatural Disasters Greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations are now more abundant in the earth\u2019s atmosphere than any time in the last 800,000 years, according to the Environmental Protection Agency , which notes, burning fossil fuels changes the climate more than any other human activity. Climate experts caution that larger and more severe weather events due to the effects of climate change have become a reality in America and threaten our future. \"Climate impacts are affecting people's lives right now,\" Costa Samaras, director of Carnegie Mellon University's Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, told ABC News.

Reducing reliance on fossil fuels which release greenhouse gasses, promoting net-zero carbon emission transportation and mitigating the exploitation and pollution of natural ecosystems are paramount in combating the effects of climate change, experts say. MORE: How the UN Plastics Treaty aims to tackle the pollution crisis \"The predominant way we currently consume, extract, exploit, produce and pollute will exacerbate the climate crisis,\" Professor Erlinde Cornelis, leader of San Diego State's Senate Sustainability Committee told ABC News. \"The U.S. has all the climate science at its fingertips, some of the best scientists in the world that can inform policy,\" Cornelis said.\u00a0\"We know where we need to go, so there is no excuse for inaction.\" Looking at the steps necessary to reduce the country's role in climate change, ABC News spoke with experts Burkett, Samaras, Henning, Cornelis and Dr. Aiguo Dai, a professor with the University at Alabany's Department of Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences. Decarbonize America As the effects of climate change come knocking at American doors across the country, Henning believes U.S. lawmakers can no longer rely on crisis response measures and instead need to address the root causes of the climate crisis. \"We need to decarbonize our heating and our transportation systems to be able to finally bend the curve and reduce our fossil fuel emissions,\" Henning said. Industrial process heat is the use of thermal energy to produce, treat, or alter manufactured goods and is the most significant source of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial sector, according to the U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy . Process heat accounts for about 50% of all onsite energy use and 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, the agency reports. Flame is visible from the top of a flare stack at the Air Liquide plant Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024 in Pasadena, Texas. Kirk Sides/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images, FILE To understand the scope of the issue, process heating systems are emission-intensive because fossil fuel combustion provides 95% of industrial heat\u00a0across the U.S.'s manufacturing sector, according to the U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

The top five countries with the highest rate of electric vehicle sales are Norway, with 80% of car sales being EV, Iceland (41%), Sweden (32%), the Netherlands (24%) and China (22%), according to the World Resources Institute , which notes, the United States had only 6% of car sales being electric. \"U.S. greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 12% between 2005 and 2019, mostly due to reductions in emissions from electric power generation,\" Burkett said. \"To reach net-zero emissions by 2050, US emissions would need to decline by more than 6% per year.\" To be consistent with international climate goals, electric vehicle sales must grow by 75% to 95% internationally by 2030, according to the World Resources Institute. Depoliticize climate change \"We can't get emissions to net-zero without getting the U.S. to net-zero,\" Samaras, who served in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), told ABC News, adding, \"The Biden-Harris administration has taken the boldest climate action in history.\" The Biden-Harris administration has channeled a substantial amount of funding toward climate action during their term, experts say, namely through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. \"The United States is finally taking really significant action, for the first time ever, through the Inflation Reduction Act, although its name wouldn't necessarily tell you that it was a major piece of climate legislation, it really was,\" Henning said.

Columbia Chief Operating Officer Cas Holloway said in a post on the university website Sunday the school was boosting \"safety measures\" on the Morningside campus. \"The gathering of large crowds on campus and around the Morningside perimeter are causing considerable disruption and distress,\" Holloway wrote, noting the school would be upping security by 35 additional guards and two additional supervisors per shift; \"enhanced perimeter security staffed by additional private security personnel\"; and additional coverage at the Kraft Center over Passover. On Thursday, demonstrators had occupied Columbia's south lawn for over 30 hours \"in violation of the university's rules\" and did not leave despite \"numerous warnings,\" Mayor Adams said at the time. NYPD arrested 108 people for trespass without incident, officials said Thursday. Among those, two were also arrested for obstruction of governmental administration, officials said. The protests, which began on April 17, followed Columbia University president Minouche Shafik's testimony to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce about antisemitism on college campuses.

            "title": "Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal solar power grants",
            "date": "2024-04-22 05:05:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program. The grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials. Biden's latest environment al announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Senior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said. Solar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid. But solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans \u2014 and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election -year politics. Forty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Biden is making the announcement at northern Virginia\u2019s Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression. Biden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions. Biden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm. He has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector. Biden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how \"a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,\u201d said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi. He said the programs can \"unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.\u201d The awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion \u201cgreen bank\u201d created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change. EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was \u201clooking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.\u201d Among those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina. The taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank\u2019s funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers. ___ St. John reported from Detroit. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

ABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee along with her team, Dan Manzo and Lindsey Griswold, traveled to Taos to stay with the community and find out what everyone can be doing to live a bit more sustainably. \"Everybody on the planet can wake up in the morning and be comfortable without fossil fuel. Everybody can grow food in their house, everybody can have electricity from the sun and wind,\" Michael Reynolds, founder and creator of Earthship Biotecture , told Zee. \"These buildings do that.\" Heating, cooling and powering buildings creates more greenhouse gas emissions than anything else in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, construction and demolition create more than 500 million tons of debris each year in this country alone, the EPA said. MORE: How the UN Plastics Treaty aims to tackle the pollution crisis The community of over 100 Earthships in Taos is made of \"living vessels\" with gravel, old tires, concrete and other discarded materials like glass bottles. Earthships are fully self-sustaining structures with timers for wifi and hot water use, according to Earthship Biotecture. Reynolds said he uses rainwater four times over for different purposes in his home. Michael Reynolds talks with ABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee outside Taos, New Mexico. ABC News \"I'm using five gallons \u2014 or three gallons of water to take a shower. That same three gallons of water waters my banana trees and my tomatoes,\" Reynolds said. \"That same three gallons of water is recollected to flush the toilet.\" Solar energy provides the homes with power, but it's not used to heat or cool the structures. Earthships use trash as insulation to keep them comfortable inside. Reynolds showed ABC News how Earthships are insulated with old tires filled with dirt. \"Each tire gets about four or five wheelbarrows of dirt pounded into them. So they're basically like steel encased Adobe bricks,\" Earthship Biotecture rental manager Hillary Hess told ABC News. \"And the sun comes in and it hits that mass. And then the tire retains it. And as the temperature in here would drop, that heat would be released.\" \"You know, on a cold February night, you walk in one of these and you go, 'This is amazing.'\" Reynolds said. \"This is warm and it's freezing outside and there's no heating system here. So if you've put people in a position to be able to experience it, then that's huge.\" An ABC News team stayed in one of the structures in Taos for three days to understand how they work and what it feels like to live in one. Hess said structure the team would be staying in is 5,400 square feet. Two thousand square feet of that is dedicated growing space. Outside Taos, New Mexico, a community of Earthships offers off-the-grid living claiming to be the answer to building sustainability. ABC News \"In this house there's two ponds in the greenhouse and we have tilapia out there,\" she said. \"So ideally, if you lived in this home, if you wanted, you could even be harvesting your own fish, chickens with eggs. And then you could catch a fish, pick your citrus, wrap it in a bag and leave and grill it out on the fire.\" Related Stories Biden announcing $7B in federal solar power grants Apr 22, 5:05 AM The EPA is again allowing summer sales of higher ethanol gasoline blend, citing global conflicts Apr 19, 3:31 PM EPA calls 2 forever chemicals hazardous substances Apr 19, 8:45 AM The small percentage of people living in Earthships aren't the only ones saying traditional living and building arrangements need to change. \"The building industry currently is known to account for approximately 40% of greenhouse gas emissions,\" Lola Ben-Alon, assistant professor at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation told ABC News. \"It's a really huge chunk of our industry in the world.\" MORE: Video The eco-friendly changes you can make that could also save you money Ben-Alon said there's no one answer as to what makes up the most sustainable home. \"There's no one solution,\" she said. \"It's really a combination of principles and a combination of design thinking with the local environment and what is available and what is the climatic context, but also the material availability context and the labor context.\" Reynolds believes the principles of Earthships can be applied everywhere. \"Not everybody's going to have an Earthship tomorrow,\" Zee said. \"If there had to be one thing from Earthships that we could apply to homes across America, what would be the most important? News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee sits with Earthship Biotecture founder and creator Michael Reynolds outside of an Earthship near Taos, New Mexico. ABC News \"I think it starts with comfort,\" Reynolds replied. \"In other words, you can add a greenhouse on the south side of your house, and that will hit those rooms that are near that. You can even in New York City, you can get an apartment with south facing windows. You can become aware of the fact that heat comes from that thing, and you can catch that heat.\" In Santa Fe New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham talked with ABC News about Earthships and other sustainability efforts in the state \"How important is it to experiment with sustainability like that?\" Zee asked. \"Because that's extreme.\" \"I think all of that has incredible value,\" Grisham said. \"It is not the No. 1 investment in sustainable living, but it is really powerful.\" \"Just their water reuse and recycling in its last place, after using it four times, is to grow food. I mean, these are particularly for states in the Southwest arid states,\" she added. \"That innovation and knowing that you can live completely off the grid and have sustainable building materials all recycled, we can do more of that.\" For his part, Reynolds said the extremity is necessary. \"I used to try to tone it down because I know that I'm a fanatic about it, and I can't expect other people to understand what I've been thinking about for decades,\" he said. \"So I try to water it down and tone it down, but now it's like, 'yeah, it's not appropriate to tone it down.' I mean, the solutions are the way forward on this planet. It's going to have to be extreme.\"",

To make a united step forward, awareness of the mounting climate crisis is vital, Dr. Virginia Burkett, chief scientist for Climate and Land Use Change at the U.S. Geological Survey told ABC News ahead of Earth Day. Planet Earth is seen in this GOES 12 satellite image taken on March 16, 2010 6:45 AM EDT. NOAA/NASA GOES Project \"The global Earth observations community has characterized a triple planetary crisis of interconnecting stressors: climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution,\" Burkett said, adding land degradation and deforestation to the list of great concern. \"Collectively, the interconnected effects of human activity pose significant challenges for human security and sustainable development,\" Burkett warned. Unnatural Disasters Greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations are now more abundant in the earth\u2019s atmosphere than any time in the last 800,000 years, according to the Environmental Protection Agency , which notes, burning fossil fuels changes the climate more than any other human activity. Climate experts caution that larger and more severe weather events due to the effects of climate change have become a reality in America and threaten our future. \"Climate impacts are affecting people's lives right now,\" Costa Samaras, director of Carnegie Mellon University's Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, told ABC News.

Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe via Getty Images, FILE \"The longer we wait to take significant action, the larger and the more complicated those problems get,\" Henning warned. Reducing reliance on fossil fuels which release greenhouse gasses, promoting net-zero carbon emission transportation and mitigating the exploitation and pollution of natural ecosystems are paramount in combating the effects of climate change, experts say. MORE: How the UN Plastics Treaty aims to tackle the pollution crisis \"The predominant way we currently consume, extract, exploit, produce and pollute will exacerbate the climate crisis,\" Professor Erlinde Cornelis, leader of San Diego State's Senate Sustainability Committee told ABC News. \"The U.S. has all the climate science at its fingertips, some of the best scientists in the world that can inform policy,\" Cornelis said.\u00a0\"We know where we need to go, so there is no excuse for inaction.\" Looking at the steps necessary to reduce the country's role in climate change, ABC News spoke with experts Burkett, Samaras, Henning, Cornelis and Dr. Aiguo Dai, a professor with the University at Alabany's Department of Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences. Decarbonize America As the effects of climate change come knocking at American doors across the country, Henning believes U.S. lawmakers can no longer rely on crisis response measures and instead need to address the root causes of the climate crisis. \"We need to decarbonize our heating and our transportation systems to be able to finally bend the curve and reduce our fossil fuel emissions,\" Henning said. Industrial process heat is the use of thermal energy to produce, treat, or alter manufactured goods and is the most significant source of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial sector, according to the U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy . Process heat accounts for about 50% of all onsite energy use and 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, the agency reports. Flame is visible from the top of a flare stack at the Air Liquide plant Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024 in Pasadena, Texas. Kirk Sides/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images, FILE To understand the scope of the issue, process heating systems are emission-intensive because fossil fuel combustion provides 95% of industrial heat\u00a0across the U.S.'s manufacturing sector, according to the U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

The top five countries with the highest rate of electric vehicle sales are Norway, with 80% of car sales being EV, Iceland (41%), Sweden (32%), the Netherlands (24%) and China (22%), according to the World Resources Institute , which notes, the United States had only 6% of car sales being electric. \"U.S. greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 12% between 2005 and 2019, mostly due to reductions in emissions from electric power generation,\" Burkett said. \"To reach net-zero emissions by 2050, US emissions would need to decline by more than 6% per year.\" To be consistent with international climate goals, electric vehicle sales must grow by 75% to 95% internationally by 2030, according to the World Resources Institute. Depoliticize climate change \"We can't get emissions to net-zero without getting the U.S. to net-zero,\" Samaras, who served in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), told ABC News, adding, \"The Biden-Harris administration has taken the boldest climate action in history.\" The Biden-Harris administration has channeled a substantial amount of funding toward climate action during their term, experts say, namely through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. \"The United States is finally taking really significant action, for the first time ever, through the Inflation Reduction Act, although its name wouldn't necessarily tell you that it was a major piece of climate legislation, it really was,\" Henning said.

            "content": "After a week-long selection process, the jurors in Donald Trump 's New York hush money case will hear opening statements Monday in the first criminal trial of a former United States president. To prove their case, lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg need to convince twelve jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump repeatedly falsified records to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election. \"This case has nothing to do with your personal politics or your feelings about a particular political issue,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told potential jurors on Thursday. \"It's not a referendum on the Trump presidency, a popularity contest, or any indication of who you plan to vote for this fall. This case is about whether this man broke the law.\" MORE: Trump hush money trial: Judge sets opening statements for Monday Trump's lawyers are expected to focus their efforts on going after the credibility of prosecution witnesses, suggesting the case itself is politically motivated and arguing the former president never intended to commit a crime. The trial has thrust allegations of illegality into the center of the 2024 presidential campaign, as Trump spends his days in a Manhattan courtroom to fight off one of the four criminal cases against him. The opening statements come the same week as Trump's lawyers head to the Supreme Court to try to advance Trump's claim of presidential immunity in his federal election interference case. \"This is a giant witch hunt to try and hurt a campaign that's beating the worst president in history,\" Trump said on Friday. Eighteen jurors have been sworn in to hear the Manhattan case, and prosecutors plan to present at least 15 days of testimony to prove their case. What is the prosecution's theory of the case? The indictment against the former president focuses on 34 business records -- 12 ledger entries, 11 checks, and 11 invoices -- that Trump allegedly falsified in order to disguise payments to his former lawyer Michael Cohen. According to prosecutors, Trump had labeled the payments as legal expenses, but the payments were actually used in part to repay Cohen for a $130,000 payment to buy the silence of adult film actress Stormy Daniels regarding a long-denied sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors allege that the payment was just one example of a broader scheme by Trump to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 election. According to prosecutors, the scheme began in August 2015, when Trump and Cohen met with the then-publisher of the National Enquirer, who agreed to act as the \"eyes and ears\" of the campaign to identify and kill negative stories. Months later, the company behind the National Enquirer made a $30,000 payment to a doorman who was shopping around a false story that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, according to prosecutors. In June 2016 -- one month before Trump became the Republican Party nominee -- American Media Inc. made a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who alleged to have had a lengthy affair with Trump, which he denies. \"That is a scheme to buy and suppress negative information to help Mr. Trump's chances of winning the election,\" Bragg said about the case at a press conference announcing the indictment in 2023. Prosecutors say the payment to Daniels came as the Trump campaign was struggling with the aftermath of the release of the \" Access Hollywood \" tape, in which Trump can be heard bragging about grabbing women. Former President Donald Trump sits at the defendant's table during his criminal trial as jury selection continues at Manhattan Criminal Court on April 19, 2024 in New York City. Sarah Yenesel-Pool/Getty Images \"Indeed, the evidence will demonstrate that the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape caused a panic within the campaign about [the] defendant's electoral prospects and ultimately served as the catalyst for consummating the Stormy Daniels payoff,\" prosecutors wrote in a filing last month. Prosecutors also plan to introduce evidence to demonstrate Trump's \"consciousness of guilt,\" including an effort to allegedly intimidate witnesses like Cohen from cooperating with investigators. \"The defendant was attempting to intimidate the likely witnesses against him, but the jury doesn't even have to work that hard because the defendant himself has publicly embraced the overt strategy of going after his perceived enemies,\" Steinglass said Monday. What is Trump's defense? Trump's lawyers have suggested that one of their main defenses will be highlighting that the former president never intended to commit a crime, including the fact that he relied on lawyers to orchestrate the alleged payments.

Some of the witnesses, according to prosecutors, have made inconsistent statements about the alleged conduct, have received immunity for their testimony, or have made media appearances to discuss their conduct. Trump has also suggested on three separate occasions that he intends to testify during the trial in his own defense. If Trump takes the stand, prosecutors hope to question the former president about a dozen past court findings in an effort to damage his credibility. MORE: Who are the 12 jurors in Trump's historic criminal trial Who are the jurors? After a lengthy jury selection process last week, Judge Juan Merchan swore in 12 jurors and six alternates to hear the case. The jury is composed of seven men and five women, the majority of whom have college degrees. They work a variety of jobs, including investment banking, teaching, physical therapy, and corporate law. If any of the jurors need to be dismissed during the trial, they would be replaced by one of the six alternate jurors, including a woman who works in creative operations for a clothing company, a contract specialist, an audio professional, and an asset manager. Who are the first witnesses? Prosecutors have mentioned a long list of potential witnesses -- including Cohen, Daniels, former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks, and others -- but have not yet disclosed their first witness, who could take the stand as early as Monday. Last week, prosecutors expressed concerns that Trump might attack the initial witness on social media if he learned who they are. Merchan declined to order prosecutors to disclose their identity, calling their concerns about Trump \"understandable.\" Steinglass ultimately offered a compromise, promising to tell the defense team the name of the first witness on Sunday under one condition. \"If that should be tweeted, that will be the last time we extend that courtesy,\" Steinglass said.",

            "date": "2024-04-21 01:05:00",
            "content": "PORTLAND, Maine -- The high electricity consumption of a home, its cardboard-covered windows and odor of marijuana drew law enforcement's attention to an illicit grow operation off the beaten path in rural Maine. The bust of the home with a hidden grow operation and seizure of nearly 40 pounds (18 kilograms) of processed marijuana marked the latest example of what authorities describe as a yearslong trend of foreign nationals to exploit U.S. state laws that have legalized cannabis for recreational or medical use to produce marijuana for the illicit markets in the U.S. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is investigating international criminal organizations that are operating illegal marijuana grows in about 20 states, including Maine, Attorney Garland Merrick Garland told the Senate Appropriations Committee this week, in response to a question raised by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. Federal law enforcement officials said there currently are about 100 illicit grow operations in Maine, like the one in Passadumkeag, about 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) north of Bangor, and about 40 search warrants have been issued since June. In Passadumkeag, Xisen Guo, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China , has been accused of transforming the house into a high-tech, illicit grow operation, according to court documents unsealed this week. He was ordered held without bail Friday on federal drug charges, making him the first person to be charged federally in such a case in Maine. A detention hearing is scheduled for Monday. The Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security, along with the FBI and DEA and local law enforcement, are working together to get to the bottom of the illicit grow operations in Maine, Garland said. The state legalized adult consumption of marijuana, but growers must be licensed by the state. The Maine Office of Cannabis Policy said Guo was operating an unlicensed operation, according to court documents. The illicit grow operations across the U.S. began cropping up several years ago. In 2018, U.S. authorities arrested a Seattle woman, conducted raids and seized thousands of marijuana plants during an investigation of an operation with Chinese ties. Oklahoma officials learned straw owners in China and Mexico were running illegal operations after marijuana was legalized by the state for medical purposes in 2018. The legality of marijuana consumption and cultivation in those states tends to provide cover for illegal grow operations, which may draw less attention, officials said. The marijuana is then trafficked in states where it's illegal. In Maine, U.S. Attorney Darcie McElwee said thwarting illegal growing operations with international connections is a priority for law enforcement, \u201cand we will continue to marshal every tool at our disposal in this effort as appropriate.\u201d Law enforcement officials know the tell-tale signs. Police zeroed in on the Passadumkeag operation in part because of the home's utility bills reviewed by deputies. After the home was purchased for $125,000 cash, the electricity use went from about $300 a month to as high as nearly $9,000, according to court documents. That\u2019s consistent with heat pumps, costly lighting and other gear needed to grow marijuana, investigators said. The home owner, a limited liability company, upgraded the electric capability to double what is found in a typical Maine home, according to documents. Guo's attorney didn\u2019t immediately return a call from The Associated Press. Two others who were at the home at the time of the police raid in February were released and not charged. McElwee said law enforcement \u2014 from local and county police to the FBI and DEA \u2014 are starting to make headway with \u201cdozens of operations\" shuttered over the last several months. \u201cThe possible involvement of foreign nationals using Maine properties to profit from unlicensed marijuana operations and interstate distributions makes it clear that there is a need for a strong and sustained federal, state and local effort to shut down these operations,\" she said. Law enforcement officials also continue to investigate who is directing the operations and where the profits are going, she said.",

            "content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A second former Arkansas law enforcement officer has pleaded guilty to violating the civil rights of a man he repeatedly punched during a violent arrest in 2022 that was caught on video and shared widely. Former Crawford County sheriff's deputy Levi White changed his plea during a hearing in federal court on Friday, according to court documents. White pleaded guilty to a felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law during the Aug. 21, 2022, arrest of Randal Worcester outside a convenience store. White and another former deputy, Zackary King, were charged by federal prosecutors last year for the arrest. A bystander used a cellphone to record the arrest in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles (220 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma. King on Monday pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of deprivation of rights under color of law. A third officer caught in the video, Mulberry Police Officer Thell Riddle, was not charged in the federal case. King and White were fired by the Crawford County sheriff. The video depicted King and White striking Worcester as Riddle held him down. White also slammed Worcester's head onto the pavement. A trial had been scheduled next month for White and King before the two changed their pleas. Sentencing hearings will be held later. White faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Police have said Worcester was being questioned for threatening a clerk at a convenience store in the nearby small town of Alma when he tackled one of the deputies and punched him in the head before the arrest. Worcester is set to go to trial in July on charges related to the arrest, including resisting arrest and second-degree battery. Worcester filed a lawsuit  in 2022 against the three officers, the city of Mulberry and Crawford County over the arrest. But that case has been put on hold while the criminal cases related to the arrest are ongoing.",

            "content": "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho sheriff's deputy died after being shot by a driver during a traffic stop, and a man believed to be the shooting suspect was later fatally shot by police, authorities said Sunday. Deputy Tobin Bolter, 27, was shot as he approached the driver's window at about 9 p.m. Saturday in Boise, and the suspect took off, Ada County Sheriff Matt Clifford said Sunday. Bolter was the first sheriff's deputy in the county to be killed in the line of duty, Clifford said. Boise police found the shooting suspect's vehicle unoccupied about a half hour after the shooting, and found a man believed to be the suspect outside a home, Boise Police Chief Ron Winegar said. The police's tactical unit responded and tried for some time to get the man to surrender, Winegar said. Some nearby residents were told to evacuate but others in the area were warned to stay inside, he said. Shortly after midnight the man fired at officers, and one officer returned fire and shot him, Winegar said. The officers gave him aid but he was pronounced dead after being taken to a hospital, he said. The man's name has not been released but authorities said he was 65 years old and wanted for arrest for a misdemeanor. A person who saw the shooting during the traffic stop called 911 and performed CPR on the deputy before an ambulance arrived, Clifford said. Another deputy on the way to the scene was involved in a crash with another vehicle, and both the deputy and the other driver were taken to the hospital, Clifford said. The deputy was in stable condition Sunday but the condition of the other person has not been released. At an emotional press conference shortly after Bolter passed away at the hospital, Clifford thanked the paramedics and the citizen who stopped to help the deputy. \u201cI think it goes to show what kind of community we live in where there are evil people that will do evil things but there are good people that help us and come to our aid,\u201d he said. Bolter had worked in law enforcement for seven years but had only joined the sheriff's office in January, Clifford said. Before that he worked for the Meridian Police Department as well as California's Pleasant Hill Police Department. Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered United States and Idaho flags to be lowered to half-staff in honor of Bolter. \u201cOur hearts break for the family, loved ones, and law enforcement colleagues of Deputy Tobin Bolter,\" Little said in a statement. \u201cDay in and day out, our brave men and women in blue put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect us and keep our communities safe.

ABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee along with her team, Dan Manzo and Lindsey Griswold, traveled to Taos to stay with the community and find out what everyone can be doing to live a bit more sustainably. \"Everybody on the planet can wake up in the morning and be comfortable without fossil fuel. Everybody can grow food in their house, everybody can have electricity from the sun and wind,\" Michael Reynolds, founder and creator of Earthship Biotecture , told Zee. \"These buildings do that.\" Heating, cooling and powering buildings creates more greenhouse gas emissions than anything else in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, construction and demolition create more than 500 million tons of debris each year in this country alone, the EPA said. MORE: How the UN Plastics Treaty aims to tackle the pollution crisis The community of over 100 Earthships in Taos is made of \"living vessels\" with gravel, old tires, concrete and other discarded materials like glass bottles. Earthships are fully self-sustaining structures with timers for wifi and hot water use, according to Earthship Biotecture. Reynolds said he uses rainwater four times over for different purposes in his home. Michael Reynolds talks with ABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee outside Taos, New Mexico. ABC News \"I'm using five gallons \u2014 or three gallons of water to take a shower. That same three gallons of water waters my banana trees and my tomatoes,\" Reynolds said. \"That same three gallons of water is recollected to flush the toilet.\" Solar energy provides the homes with power, but it's not used to heat or cool the structures. Earthships use trash as insulation to keep them comfortable inside. Reynolds showed ABC News how Earthships are insulated with old tires filled with dirt. \"Each tire gets about four or five wheelbarrows of dirt pounded into them. So they're basically like steel encased Adobe bricks,\" Earthship Biotecture rental manager Hillary Hess told ABC News. \"And the sun comes in and it hits that mass. And then the tire retains it. And as the temperature in here would drop, that heat would be released.\" \"You know, on a cold February night, you walk in one of these and you go, 'This is amazing.'\" Reynolds said. \"This is warm and it's freezing outside and there's no heating system here. So if you've put people in a position to be able to experience it, then that's huge.\" An ABC News team stayed in one of the structures in Taos for three days to understand how they work and what it feels like to live in one. Hess said structure the team would be staying in is 5,400 square feet. Two thousand square feet of that is dedicated growing space. Outside Taos, New Mexico, a community of Earthships offers off-the-grid living claiming to be the answer to building sustainability. ABC News \"In this house there's two ponds in the greenhouse and we have tilapia out there,\" she said. \"So ideally, if you lived in this home, if you wanted, you could even be harvesting your own fish, chickens with eggs. And then you could catch a fish, pick your citrus, wrap it in a bag and leave and grill it out on the fire.\" The small percentage of people living in Earthships aren't the only ones saying traditional living and building arrangements need to change. \"The building industry currently is known to account for approximately 40% of greenhouse gas emissions,\" Lola Ben-Alon, assistant professor at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation told ABC News. \"It's a really huge chunk of our industry in the world.\" MORE: Video The eco-friendly changes you can make that could also save you money Ben-Alon said there's no one answer as to what makes up the most sustainable home. \"There's no one solution,\" she said. \"It's really a combination of principles and a combination of design thinking with the local environment and what is available and what is the climatic context, but also the material availability context and the labor context.\" Reynolds believes the principles of Earthships can be applied everywhere. \"Not everybody's going to have an Earthship tomorrow,\" Zee said. \"If there had to be one thing from Earthships that we could apply to homes across America, what would be the most important? News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee sits with Earthship Biotecture founder and creator Michael Reynolds outside of an Earthship near Taos, New Mexico. ABC News \"I think it starts with comfort,\" Reynolds replied. \"In other words, you can add a greenhouse on the south side of your house, and that will hit those rooms that are near that. You can even in New York City, you can get an apartment with south facing windows. You can become aware of the fact that heat comes from that thing, and you can catch that heat.\" In Santa Fe New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham talked with ABC News about Earthships and other sustainability efforts in the state \"How important is it to experiment with sustainability like that?\" Zee asked. \"Because that's extreme.\" \"I think all of that has incredible value,\" Grisham said. \"It is not the No. 1 investment in sustainable living, but it is really powerful.\" \"Just their water reuse and recycling in its last place, after using it four times, is to grow food. I mean, these are particularly for states in the Southwest arid states,\" she added. \"That innovation and knowing that you can live completely off the grid and have sustainable building materials all recycled, we can do more of that.\" For his part, Reynolds said the extremity is necessary. \"I used to try to tone it down because I know that I'm a fanatic about it, and I can't expect other people to understand what I've been thinking about for decades,\" he said. \"So I try to water it down and tone it down, but now it's like, 'yeah, it's not appropriate to tone it down.' I mean, the solutions are the way forward on this planet. It's going to have to be extreme.\"",

The sustainability movement is increasingly getting a boost from famous faces as celebrities lend their voices to causes close to their hearts and environmental issues that they are most concerned about, experts told ABC News. The idea of celebrity endorsements is a well-known phenomenon, but the growing trend of famous people promoting environmental causes is emerging at the same time that the climate crisis is inching further into the public awareness, which amplifies the importance of getting messages promoting environmental action to the masses, Christy Denckla, an assistant professor of social and behavioral sciences at Harvard University, told ABC News. Celebrities, with their wide reach and significant following, could potentially have the capacity to \"really mobilize tremendous action\" at a scale to effectively address change, Denckla said. They also could provide a focal point for a complex topic such as environmentalism, where public messaging can range anywhere from cautioning against overconsumption, to biodiversity conservation to the ranking of the most dangerous greenhouse gases and where the emissions come from, Thomai Sedari, professor of marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business and director of the Fashion & Luxury MBA, told ABC News. \"I think the consumer has had difficulty understanding where the truth is and who to believe,\" Sedari said.

Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via AP The more household names that get involved in environmental causes, the better, Sedari said, adding that authenticity, passion and leading by example are integral in getting the message across as well. Celebrities need to be consistent and \"constantly\" talk about their projects and demonstrate how the causes they're fighting for impact people's lives. People who are passionate have an easier time explaining the issues more clearly and can ignite passion in others, she said. \"People are skeptical,\" Sedari said. \"Those who don't understand what sustainability is, they're skeptical.\" Many notable figures are natural-born storytellers and are able to bring their passions and personal lived experiences to the forefront of the causes they promote, Carolina Garc\u00eda Jayaram, CEO of the Elevate Prize Foundation, which honors celebrities who use their platform for good, told ABC News. There is no question that celebrity endorsements can elicit more community action on an issue, but the next critical question becomes whether those actions are actually effective, Denckla said. The rate of efficacy from these endorsements is currently unclear, particularly when it comes to impacting major policies and industry practices, according to some experts. In past decades, A-list names like Jane Fonda, Daryl Hannah and Leonardo DiCaprio were among the celebrities best known for environmental work. But the list is ever-growing. ABC News spoke to several celebrities on why they decided to endorse environmentally friendly brands and causes: Taye Diggs saw how easy it is to make sustainable changes Actor Taye Digg admits he was \"very late\" to the sustainability movement, but it was a logical move once he realized how making small changes at home could lead to exponential mitigation impacts down the road, he told ABC News. The complexity of environmentalism as a whole can be daunting, but narrowing down how he could contribute to the climate fight by making simple swaps made participating in climate action more feasible and solutions-based. \"The type of person I am -- I have to focus on the micro, instead of the macro,\" he said. Diggs, known for his roles in \"Stella Got Her Groove Back,\" \"Rent\" and \"Private Practice,\" has partnered with Tru Earth, an eco-friendly, hypoallergenic laundry strips that eliminate the consumption of plastic. 0:28 Can celebrities help move the needle on climate change?

MORE: Can shaming help mitigate the climate crisis? Experts offer mixed views Matt Damon's travels sparked a passion for water access Actor Matt Damon cofounded international nonprofit Water.org in 2009 after decades of witnessing the enormity of the water crisis around the world, he told ABC News via email. He first learned about water access inequalities in the 1980s during a trip to Guatemala with his mother and then again years later when he spent time with families in a village in Zambia. There, he accompanied a young girl on a trip to collect water after her school day had ended. The girl's story had a profound effect on Damon. \"Had there not been a water source implemented in her community, she might not be able to attend school, and have dreams of one day moving to the big city and becoming a nurse,\" he said. \"Her primary focus would be on where she sourced water for her family each day. It was shocking to me \u2013 both the awareness that living without access to safe water and sanitation came at the expense of lives and opportunities, and that no one was talking about it.\" Matt Damon, actor and co-founder of Water.org, speaks during the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit in New York, Sept. 21, 2022. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images One in four people on Earth, or about 2.2 billion people, lack access to safe drinking water, according to the United Nations . As climate change exacerbates issues like rising sea levels and more frequent and extreme occurrences of flooding and drought -- events that affect water systems -- those living in poverty are feeling the impacts more acutely, Damon said. Damon's passion was driven by a shared belief with Water.org CEO Gary White that community-led solutions would honor the agency of those people, he said.

He has received public recognition for his desire to elevate awareness of social impact issues, most recently in January when he was awarded the Elevate Prize Catalyst Award. It recognizes prominent individuals who use their influence to inspire social action and provides $250,000 in unrestricted funding to advance their mission and scale their work. Water.org has provided more than 63 million people with safe water and sanitation to date, Damon said. \"I have been fortunate enough with my platform to amplify the ubiquity of the water crisis, but I am only one piece of a very dedicated network of people at Water.org and beyond who have committed their lives and careers to making universal access to safe water and sanitation a reality,\" he said.

What researchers are doing to restore coral ecosystems and preserve biodiversity Nikki Reed's family inspired her to work for a healthier planet Actress Nikki Reed said she was pregnant during the making of \"Common Ground,\" a documentary that showcases white, Black and Indigenous farmers who are using regenerative models of agriculture that could help to balance the climate, make food more healthful and stabilize America's economy, she told ABC News. It was Reed's two children -- and the reprioritization of family during the slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic -- that helped her envision a future where generations of kids could understand how to \"take care of the earth,\" she said. Reed said that while it can be \"daunting\" and \"overwhelming\" to talk about the climate crisis as a whole, the filmmakers wanted to highlight how every person on the planet is affected by the health of soil. Making the connection between consumers and the making and production of their food was a critical component of the film, Reed said. \"I think humanity is becoming more disconnected from the things that are right in front of us, including what's on our plate, right?\" she said. \"And so part of seeing the faces and the stories and the lives and the love and the loss, and also the triumph is, I think, a really important component of this film.\" 0:50 Can celebrities help move the needle on climate change? Actors become activists as they lend their public platforms to fight for climate action.

To make a united step forward, awareness of the mounting climate crisis is vital, Dr. Virginia Burkett, chief scientist for Climate and Land Use Change at the U.S. Geological Survey told ABC News ahead of Earth Day. Planet Earth is seen in this GOES 12 satellite image taken on March 16, 2010 6:45 AM EDT. NOAA/NASA GOES Project \"The global Earth observations community has characterized a triple planetary crisis of interconnecting stressors: climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution,\" Burkett said, adding land degradation and deforestation to the list of great concern. \"Collectively, the interconnected effects of human activity pose significant challenges for human security and sustainable development,\" Burkett warned. Unnatural Disasters Greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations are now more abundant in the earth\u2019s atmosphere than any time in the last 800,000 years, according to the Environmental Protection Agency , which notes, burning fossil fuels changes the climate more than any other human activity. Climate experts caution that larger and more severe weather events due to the effects of climate change have become a reality in America and threaten our future. \"Climate impacts are affecting people's lives right now,\" Costa Samaras, director of Carnegie Mellon University's Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, told ABC News.

MORE: How the UN Plastics Treaty aims to tackle the pollution crisis \"The predominant way we currently consume, extract, exploit, produce and pollute will exacerbate the climate crisis,\" Professor Erlinde Cornelis, leader of San Diego State's Senate Sustainability Committee told ABC News. \"The U.S. has all the climate science at its fingertips, some of the best scientists in the world that can inform policy,\" Cornelis said.\u00a0\"We know where we need to go, so there is no excuse for inaction.\" Looking at the steps necessary to reduce the country's role in climate change, ABC News spoke with experts Burkett, Samaras, Henning, Cornelis and Dr. Aiguo Dai, a professor with the University at Alabany's Department of Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences. Decarbonize America As the effects of climate change come knocking at American doors across the country, Henning believes U.S. lawmakers can no longer rely on crisis response measures and instead need to address the root causes of the climate crisis. \"We need to decarbonize our heating and our transportation systems to be able to finally bend the curve and reduce our fossil fuel emissions,\" Henning said. Industrial process heat is the use of thermal energy to produce, treat, or alter manufactured goods and is the most significant source of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial sector, according to the U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy . Process heat accounts for about 50% of all onsite energy use and 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, the agency reports. Flame is visible from the top of a flare stack at the Air Liquide plant Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024 in Pasadena, Texas.

This case is about whether this man broke the law.\" MORE: Trump hush money trial: Judge sets opening statements for Monday Trump's lawyers are expected to focus their efforts on going after the credibility of prosecution witnesses, suggesting the case itself is politically motivated and arguing the former president never intended to commit a crime. The trial has thrust allegations of illegality into the center of the 2024 presidential campaign, as Trump spends his days in a Manhattan courtroom to fight off one of the four criminal cases against him. The opening statements come the same week as Trump's lawyers head to the Supreme Court to try to advance Trump's claim of presidential immunity in his federal election interference case. \"This is a giant witch hunt to try and hurt a campaign that's beating the worst president in history,\" Trump said on Friday. Eighteen jurors have been sworn in to hear the Manhattan case, and prosecutors plan to present at least 15 days of testimony to prove their case. What is the prosecution's theory of the case? The indictment against the former president focuses on 34 business records -- 12 ledger entries, 11 checks, and 11 invoices -- that Trump allegedly falsified in order to disguise payments to his former lawyer Michael Cohen. According to prosecutors, Trump had labeled the payments as legal expenses, but the payments were actually used in part to repay Cohen for a $130,000 payment to buy the silence of adult film actress Stormy Daniels regarding a long-denied sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors allege that the payment was just one example of a broader scheme by Trump to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 election. According to prosecutors, the scheme began in August 2015, when Trump and Cohen met with the then-publisher of the National Enquirer, who agreed to act as the \"eyes and ears\" of the campaign to identify and kill negative stories. Months later, the company behind the National Enquirer made a $30,000 payment to a doorman who was shopping around a false story that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, according to prosecutors. In June 2016 -- one month before Trump became the Republican Party nominee -- American Media Inc. made a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who alleged to have had a lengthy affair with Trump, which he denies. \"That is a scheme to buy and suppress negative information to help Mr. Trump's chances of winning the election,\" Bragg said about the case at a press conference announcing the indictment in 2023. Prosecutors say the payment to Daniels came as the Trump campaign was struggling with the aftermath of the release of the \" Access Hollywood \" tape, in which Trump can be heard bragging about grabbing women. Former President Donald Trump sits at the defendant's table during his criminal trial as jury selection continues at Manhattan Criminal Court on April 19, 2024 in New York City. Sarah Yenesel-Pool/Getty Images \"Indeed, the evidence will demonstrate that the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape caused a panic within the campaign about [the] defendant's electoral prospects and ultimately served as the catalyst for consummating the Stormy Daniels payoff,\" prosecutors wrote in a filing last month. Prosecutors also plan to introduce evidence to demonstrate Trump's \"consciousness of guilt,\" including an effort to allegedly intimidate witnesses like Cohen from cooperating with investigators. \"The defendant was attempting to intimidate the likely witnesses against him, but the jury doesn't even have to work that hard because the defendant himself has publicly embraced the overt strategy of going after his perceived enemies,\" Steinglass said Monday. What is Trump's defense? Trump's lawyers have suggested that one of their main defenses will be highlighting that the former president never intended to commit a crime, including the fact that he relied on lawyers to orchestrate the alleged payments. \"I was paying a lawyer and I marked it down as a legal expense, some accountant,\" Trump said last week. \"Legal expense -- that's what you're supposed to call it.\" Trump's lawyers are also expected to hammer the credibility of the state's witnesses, including Cohen, who previously pleaded guilty to federal charges associated with the alleged scheme, as well as other charges including lying to Congress in what Cohen says was an effort to protect Trump. \"We are going to be very up-front about the fact that several of the witnesses in this case have what you might consider to be some baggage,\" Steinglass told potential jurors last week. Some of the witnesses, according to prosecutors, have made inconsistent statements about the alleged conduct, have received immunity for their testimony, or have made media appearances to discuss their conduct. Trump has also suggested on three separate occasions that he intends to testify during the trial in his own defense. If Trump takes the stand, prosecutors hope to question the former president about a dozen past court findings in an effort to damage his credibility. MORE: Who are the 12 jurors in Trump's historic criminal trial Who are the jurors? After a lengthy jury selection process last week, Judge Juan Merchan swore in 12 jurors and six alternates to hear the case. The jury is composed of seven men and five women, the majority of whom have college degrees. They work a variety of jobs, including investment banking, teaching, physical therapy, and corporate law. If any of the jurors need to be dismissed during the trial, they would be replaced by one of the six alternate jurors, including a woman who works in creative operations for a clothing company, a contract specialist, an audio professional, and an asset manager. Who are the first witnesses? Prosecutors have mentioned a long list of potential witnesses -- including Cohen, Daniels, former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks, and others -- but have not yet disclosed their first witness, who could take the stand as early as Monday. Last week, prosecutors expressed concerns that Trump might attack the initial witness on social media if he learned who they are. Merchan declined to order prosecutors to disclose their identity, calling their concerns about Trump \"understandable.\" Steinglass ultimately offered a compromise, promising to tell the defense team the name of the first witness on Sunday under one condition. \"If that should be tweeted, that will be the last time we extend that courtesy,\" Steinglass said.",

            "content": "Attorneys Donald Trump are expected back in court on Monday to defend the $175 million bond in the former president's civil fraud case, days after New York Attorney General Letitia James urged the court to reject the bond and give Trump seven days to find a new one. Judge Arthur Engoron ordered the hearing earlier this month after James took exception to the bond and asked the company behind the bond -- Knight Specialty Insurance Company -- to prove they are sufficiently collateralized to pay the bond if Trump's appeal of the $464 million judgment fails. The bond hearing presents a legal double-header for the former president, who is required to attend the opening statements in his criminal hush money trial on Monday morning. Down the street from the criminal courthouse, Judge Engoron will hear arguments in civil court that could place the former president in financial dire straits if the bond is rejected. MORE: New York AG asks court to reject Trump's $175M bond for civil judgment Trump's bond saga began in February when Engoron ordered the former president and his co-defendants pay $464 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest for engaging in what he found to be a decade of business fraud . Trump attempted to delay the fine, telling an appellate court that finding a surety willing to handle a half-billion-dollar bond was a \"practical impossibility.\" James vowed to begin seizing Trump's assets, including his namesake buildings, if he did not pay the judgment in time. \"If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek judgment enforcement mechanisms in court, and we will ask the judge to seize his assets,\" James said in an interview with ABC News. At the deadline for Trump to pay the judgment, New York's Appellate Division First Department granted the former president's eleventh-hour request to reduce the size of his bond, permitting him to post a bond of $175 million. Former President Donald Trump speaks to guests at a rally, April 2, 2024, in Green Bay, Wis. Scott Olson/Getty Images Days later, Trump and his co-defendants posted a $175 million bond collateralized using $175,304,075 held in a Charles Schwab brokerage account controlled by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. Because the company behind the bond was not admitted in New York, James filed a notice that requires Knight Speciality Insurance to demonstrate they are capable of paying the bond if needed. \"KSIC is a respected, well-capitalized, Delaware-domiciled insurer that has long underwritten surety bonds and other types of insurance placed around the country,\" attorneys for Knight Speciality Insurance and Trump wrote in a filing last week. The filing specified that the bond was secured by more than $175 billion held in a brokerage account controlled by Knight, which independently maintained more than $539 million in their own assets. The filing also stated that the company has access to more than $2 billion in assets through their parent company.

In a filing on Friday, the New York Attorney General argued that the bond itself should be rejected because the defendants failed to prove that Knight could handle \"this extraordinarily large undertaking\" and that the bond was sufficiently collateralized. MORE: In win for Trump, appeals court lowers his bond to $175M in civil fraud case According to James' filing, Knight does not have the exclusive right to control the money in Trump's brokerage account, which could become problematic if the value of Trump's assets in the account dips below $175 million. James also raised issues with Knight's business practices, which she argued should make the company ineligible to do business in New York. \"KSIC is not qualified to act as the surety under this standard because its management has been found by federal authorities to have operated affiliated companies within KSIC's holding company structure in violation of federal law on multiple occasions within the past several years,\" the filing said. Don Hankey -- the chairman of Knight Specialty's parent company -- declined to comment on the attorney general's recent filing on Friday. In an interview with ABC News on April 4, he said he had \"no concerns at all\" about the bond. \"Seldom do our applications or our bonds get turned down. I imagine it is being scrutinized very carefully, and they're checking to make sure all the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed,\" Hankey said. \"It's a large amount for anybody.\"",

During a recent effort in Pittsburgh, Church, a biology professor who leads local canvasses for the project, recalled to ABC News how she used to lobby lawmakers directly to take action on climate change, but they told her voters don't care about the issue. She said she's now trying to prove them wrong. \"The people who prioritize climate and the environment need to show up,\" Church said. \"That's how we're going to get anything done.\" ABC News' MaryAlice Parks interviews Environmental Voter Project volunteers in Pittsburgh, PA. Julia Cherner/ABC News The Environmental Voter Project, or EVP, is targeting very specific individuals: registered voters who list climate change as their No. 1 issue but who are unlikely to cast ballots in November's election based on their voting history. \"Our biggest problem in the climate movement right now [is] we don't have enough voting power,\" EVP founder and executive Nathaniel Stinnett said. ABC News' MaryAlice Parks interviews Environmental Voter Project founder and Executive Director Nathaniel Stinnett in Pittsburgh, PA. Julia Cherner/ABC News EVP takes a targeted approach to door knocking, Stinnett explained. Using polling, the group first determines which registered voters in a particular area, like Pittsburgh, would rank climate as their top voting issue. They then cross-reference profiles with voting records to find people who have not come out to the polls recently or regularly. By Stinnett's accounting, the group has been successful across general elections, primaries and even in local races. \"We've sometimes increased turnout by as much as 1.8 percentage points in general elections, 3.6 points in primaries and 5.7 points in local elections,\" he said, noting that while 1.8 percentage points might sound small, it could determine an election. Pennsylvania, for example, was only won by President Joe Biden in 2020 by 1.17%. For the canvassing effort in Pittsburgh, Stinnett said EVP targeted people who didn't vote in the 2020 election or elections in the years since. He added that they identified 22,135 voters in the city who are highly likely to rank climate as their top priority but unlikely to vote in November. Environmental Voter Project volunteer Emily Church leads a training on canvassing in Pittsburgh, PA. Julia Cherner/ABC News The group claims nonpartisanship but acknowledges that right now it's Democrats working on climate change almost exclusively. One of their hopes is to bring more Republicans to the table, too. \"We want to scare the bejesus out of as many politicians as possible, no matter what side of the aisle they're on, until they think, 'You know what, the only way I can win elections is if I start recognizing the biggest crisis,'\" Stinnett said.

In 2010, only a slim majority of Americans agreed that global warming was occurring, according to polling by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication . Now, 72% of Americans agree. But climate is currently not one of the biggest motivators for people this election cycle, surveys have indicated -- though climate advocates hope to change the electorate by encouraging turnout of climate-concerned voters. According to a February poll by the Wall Street Journal , registered voters listed immigration (20%), the economy (14%), abortion (8%) and democracy (8%) as their top issues. Climate change ranked 11th, with 2% of voters choosing it as their top issue.

ABC News' MaryAlice Parks interviews Environmental Voter Project volunteers in Pittsburgh, PA. Julia Cherner/ABC News Polling has also shown that in addition to a partisan divide on the issue, a generational shift may be at play. \"Young voters in general tend to be more Democratic, and that is kind of tied up inextricably with their belief that climate is really important,\" said Nathaniel Rakich, a senior editor and senior elections analyst at 538. \"So if Republicans don't want to basically be losing this upcoming electorate by large margins for decades to come, they're going to have to eat into that Democratic support by at least proposing some solutions and addressing climate change.\" Even the Biden administration, which has prioritized fighting climate change, is being pushed by progressives to do more on the issue. Twenty-one activists with the environmental advocacy group Sunrise Movement were arrested outside of Biden campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, in February. That group and other advocates have additional demonstrations planned in the run-up to the November election. \"I think there were some missteps by the administration -- permitting the Willow project in Alaska was a step backwards. That was unfortunate,\" Evergreen Action Executive Director Lena Moffitt said, referring to a large-scale oil drilling initiative backed by Alaska lawmakers and others in the state for its economic value, but which environmentalists criticized as undercutting the White House's climate goals.

Julia Cherner/ABC News \"We know that we need to move away from fossil fuels and, at the same time, the administration is doing a lot to hasten that move away from fossil fuels,\" Moffitt said. The choice for voters in November, on the issue of climate, is stark. President Biden has spoken urgently of the dangers of not slowing climate change and has pushed renewable energy solutions, backed electric vehicle infrastructure and created a new Climate Corps to train and expand the environmental workforce. Biden last week finalized new protections against oil and gas production for some13 million acres of land in Alaska and, through the Environmental Protection Agency, has imposed aggressive emissions standards for vehicles to cut future greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump, who has long questioned climate science, without evidence, has opposed Biden's clean energy policies and promised to roll them back -- arguing they are a drag on the economy and make the U.S. less competitive and independent.

Instead, it's all your fault for having a plastic water bottle in your hand.' And we bought it. We bought it hook, line and sinker,\" he said. \"In truth, it is far more of a political and a systemic problem that needs political and systemic solutions.\" In Pittsburgh, Church said that despite the difficulty in getting new, environmentally minded voters to the polls, she thinks the challenge is worth it. \"The science is very clear. So we know what we need to do,\" she said, \"it's just a matter of getting it done.\"",

            "content": "After much public debate, a Maine law has brought the country closer to having the popular vote determine the winner of national presidential elections -- but it's unlikely that will happen before November or even at all. Earlier this week, Maine Gov. Janet Mills allowed a bill to become law without her signature that would take effect once the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is able to gather pledges for at least 270 electoral votes -- the number of delegate votes needed to elect a president. The movement has now gathered pledges from 17 states and Washington, D.C. -- accounting for a total of 209 electoral votes. MORE: It's really hard to change Electoral College rules The movement seeks to change the way a president is chosen, without a constitutional amendment, but experts say it's unclear what happens when enough states have signed on. It's unlikely this would happen before the 2024 election. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact seeks to guarantee that the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia wins the presidency. When there are enough states pledging their popular votes to meet the 270 Electoral College vote threshold, all the votes in those states will be added up to a national count that determines the winner of the election. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact says that will give each vote equal weight regardless of where a voter lives. Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills delivers her State of the State address, Jan. 30, 2024, at the State House in Augusta, Maine. Robert F. Bukaty/AP Five of the 46 presidents who came into office lost the popular vote, including Donald Trump most recently in 2016. The compact argues that not every vote is equal under the current system. \"Under the current system, a small number of votes in a small number of states regularly decides the Presidency. All-or-nothing payoffs fuel doubt, controversy over real or imagined irregularities, hair-splitting post-election litigation, and unrest,\" the compact says on its website. \"In 2020, if 21,461 voters had changed their minds, Joe Biden would have been defeated, despite leading by over 7 million votes nationally. \u00a0Each of these 21,461 voters (5,229 in Arizona, 5,890 in Georgia, and 10,342 in Wisconsin) was 329 times more important than the 7 million voters elsewhere,\" the compact says. One expert says that everything that has to do with the Electoral College is controversial these days with a partisan divide on the issue. Many Democrats want to get rid of it, while more Republicans support it. \"If you look at all the presidential elections from 1992 through 2020, Republicans have won the presidential popular vote only once -- and that was in 2004 when [George W.] Bush beat John Kerry in the popular vote. In every other election over the last 30 years, Democrats have won the popular vote, but because of the Electoral College, Republicans have gotten the presidency a couple of times despite losing the popular vote,\" Darrell West, a Douglas Dillon chair in governmental studies at the Brookings Institute, told ABC News in an interview. MORE: Does it matter that Democrats are raising more money than Republicans? \"Republicans feel the Electoral College advantages them now and so they don't want to get rid of it,\" West said. West said the country currently only has a handful of swing states because of the Electoral College, so candidates spend most of their money on that small number of states. \"If we got rid of the Electoral College, candidates actually would campaign more broadly. They would visit more states because a vote in Illinois is the same as a vote in California,\" West said. Could this work? Experts say the most direct way to change how presidents are elected is to amend the U.S. Constitution, but there doesn't currently seem to be a feasible pathway without a consensus between both parties. \"Ultimately, there probably is going to have to be a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Electoral College, but everyone knows that's not possible now for political reasons. It takes a very large majority in Congress as well as in the states to make any change to the Constitution. So what states are trying to figure out is, 'Short of a constitutional amendment, are there ways to improve the Electoral College?'\" West said.

I mean, in my judgment, I think it needs congressional consent,\" Derek Muller, a law professor at Notre Dame Law School, told ABC News. \"If Congress fails to do that, I'm sure there will be litigation,\" Muller said.

There are other legal questions, such as whether it would violate equal protections if the U.S. were to have different states with different rules for their elections and questions about whether a state has the authority to do this, Muller said. \"There are lots of open, contested questions ... where I think the national popular vote, if it does hit 270, will immediately face a series of legal challenges,\" Muller said. West agreed that the legal situation is unclear. \"It's not obvious what the status would be of these laws. States do have the authority to set election laws. But according to the Constitution, the electors to the Electoral College actually are free to vote the way they want,\" West said. \"And so states can pass laws, but there haven't been a lot of cases testing these provisions. And so it's not clear how the Supreme Court would rule on this issue,\" West added. Muller said if a state sues another state, that case would go directly before the U.S. Supreme Court. \"It's really unclear who would bring the challenge or where they would bring it. One of the more interesting wrinkles is that there is the possibility, when you're dealing with a compact, you file directly in the United States Supreme Court so that could be a place where it goes. But again, I think there's a lot of possibilities about the litigation strategy if it does hit 270 [pledges],\" Muller said. Has something like this happened before? About 100 years ago, before the 17th Amendment was passed -- which allows for the direct election of senators -- states had begun shifting from legislatures choosing members sent by the state to the U.S. Senate to having \"preference polls\" for the public where they would signal who they wanted to represent the state. MORE: What are the states that could vote on abortion or reproductive rights in November? \"Some states -- I think Oregon was one of the leaders among some others -- would institute preference polls for the people for their senators. So they would hold an election that wasn't binding, but it would just request, 'Who do you want us to vote for?' And then you got a sentiment from the people and the legislature could or could not follow that,\" Muller said. Later, those states -- including Oregon -- began binding themselves to the results of the preference polls, Muller said. He pointed to this as an analogy in which the states were trying to \"convert legislative elections into a popular vote, even though there was no formal mechanism to do so.\" An exterior view of The White House on January 19, 2021 in Washington, DC. Eric Thayer/Getty Images Eventually, the Constitution was amended to make Senate seats elected by popular vote. West argues that the direct election of senators did require the constitutional amendment to go into effect. \"And that was 100 years ago, when the political times were less polarized than what we have today,\" West said. MORE: Nikki Haley's next move is going to a think tank after becoming major Trump critic Some states unsuccessfully tried to implement term limits for members of Congress about 20 or 30 years ago, Muller said. The Supreme Court said that was unconstitutional in 1995. \"So Missouri tried something a little more creative, which was to say, 'OK, we're going to ask all candidates to take a term-limits pledge, and we're gonna print if they violated their pledge, we're gonna put that on the ballot, or if they declined to support the term-limits pledge ... we're gonna print that on the ballot,'\" Muller said. \"The goal was to say, 'Well, we're not keeping you off the ballot, we're just telling everyone whether or not you're adhering to term limits,'\" Muller said. \"And the Supreme Court said, 'Well you can't do that either.'\"",

            "content": "ABC News is taking a look at solutions for issues related to climate change and the environment with the series, \u201cThe Power of Us: People, The Climate, and Our Future.\u201d Corporate America took notice four years ago when Larry Fink, CEO of investment giant BlackRock, declared climate change a top concern. \u201cClimate risk is investment risk,\u201d Fink wrote in an annual letter popular in C-suites. His latest letter, released last month, spans well over 100 paragraphs before the first mention of \u201cclimate.\u201d Whereas Fink mentioned \u201cclimate\u201d a total of 29 times in the 2020 letter, he wrote it just four times in the missive last month. The shift in Fink\u2019s letters has coincided with an apparent wider chill of momentum behind climate action among many of the world\u2019s largest companies, which have faced a conservative backlash against sustainable business practices derided as \u201c woke capitalism ,\u201d experts told ABC News. Many firms have struggled to follow through on ambitious, years-old climate pledges, in part due to high interest rates that make funding more expensive, the experts added, noting that some environmentally conscious companies have bucked the trend. MORE: Food prices could increase further due to climate change's effect on inflation around the world: Study \u201cBlackRock is still considering climate risk but boy has their message changed,\u201d Mindy Lubber, chief executive of environmental advocacy group Ceres, which examines corporate conduct, told ABC News. \u201cThe pushback has been fierce and severe, and we\u2019re seeing things slow down,\u201d Lubber added. BlackRock did not respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment. In a statement on its website, BlackRock says a worldwide transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 would \"benefit the global economy and our clients in aggregate.\" In turn, BlackRock encourages clients to develop \"robust transition plans\" by 2030, the statement adds, noting the limitations of BlackRock's role as an asset manager. \"BlackRock\u2019s role in the transition is as a fiduciary to our clients,\" the statement says. \"Our role is to help them navigate investment risks and opportunities, not to engineer a specific decarbonization outcome in the real economy.\" A little over half of the world\u2019s largest 2,000 companies have adopted pledges to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, according to data from research firm Net Zero Tracker reviewed by ABC News. Net zero marks the point at which a given firm offsets its emissions by removing the same amount of carbon from the atmosphere. The number of companies with net-zero pledges has jumped 40% over the past 16 months, the data showed. However, the vast majority of the company pledges lack credibility, Net Zero said, noting that only one out of every 20 commitments meets United Nations guidelines for what constitutes a quality pledge. To meet the U.N. threshold for a quality pledge, a company must adopt a plan to address all forms of carbon emissions, present intermediate goals for emissions cuts by 2030 and align its government lobbying with the objective of net zero, among other criteria. \u201cThere is unequivocally a massive lack in the quality of these plans,\u201d John Lang, the project lead at Net Zero Tracker, told ABC News. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen momentum or movement on that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easy to set a target,\u201d Lang said. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to create a robust plan to meet that target.\u201d Dave White, director of the Global Institute of Sustainability and Innovation at Arizona State University, said the evidence of major companies fulfilling climate pledges is \u201cmixed at best.\u201d Related Stories Trump rally canceled due to severe weather Apr 20, 7:03 PM Attorneys argue that Florida law discriminates against Chinese nationals trying to buy homes Apr 19, 1:56 PM Florida will open schools to volunteer chaplains Apr 18, 4:10 PM \u201cWe\u2019ve seen important progress but many of these companies are realizing they\u2019re meeting only a small fraction of the aspirational goals they've made,\u201d White said. Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, Jan. 12, 2024. Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE Experts who spoke with ABC News attributed the corporate difficulties to a surge of conservative criticism over sustainable business practices as well as high interest rates, which make it more costly for companies to pursue capital-intensive climate initiatives. Conservatives have directed much of their ire at environmental, social and governance investing, or ESG , a type of investing that takes into account non-financial information about a company, such as its climate impact and staff diversity. Prominent Republican politicians, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have assailed ESG as a portfolio strategy that prioritizes liberal goals over investor returns. Eighteen states have adopted anti-ESG legislation -- and all but one features a Republican governor, law firm K &L Gates found in July. \"When it comes to things like these Wall Street banks, what they're doing to try to impose an agenda is something that's very, very troubling,\" DeSantis said last May upon signing a law that prohibits state officials from investing state money to further ESG goals. Some on the left have questioned the rigor of ESG funds, warning that they establish insufficient standards for companies seeking to qualify. ESG investing, meanwhile, has sharply declined. Funds worldwide categorized as \"responsible investing\" received $68 billion of net new deposits in 2023 through November, according to data from financial firm LSEG Lipper. That amount had fallen dramatically from $158 billion for all of 2022 and $558 billion for all of 2021. MORE: How climate change is affecting DC's iconic cherry blossoms The backlash from conservatives, White said, has hampered corporate conduct beyond ESG, including carbon emissions commitments. \u201cThe politicization of this area in some cases is providing cover for corporations to backslide on their commitments,\u201d White said. To be sure, some companies have continued to achieve progress toward achieving net-zero emissions, some experts said, noting that the recent hiccup in climate action owes more to the scale of the task than the reluctance of the corporations. \u201cThe transition to a carbon neutral economy that we\u2019re experiencing is really a transition on the scale of the great industrial revolution,\u201d George Georgiev, a professor at Emory University School of Law, told ABC News. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a retrenchment -- it\u2019s more of a professionalization of the function within companies and them being more careful,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not moving fast enough but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t adjust course.\u201d",

Fred Guttenberg, who lost his daughter Jaime in the shooting, was one of the parents who pushed for elected officials to take the tour and meet with the families about tackling gun violence. He spoke with ABC News' Rachel Scott shortly after the visit.

Marco Bello/Reuters ABC NEWS LIVE: I do want to start with you telling me about your push to get the vice president here. Where did that come from? FRED GUTTENBERG: I guess about 10 months ago, when the building was turned over from the state attorney to the school district, one of the other dads, Max Schachter, had this idea of walking through political people to see what's happening in that building, or what happened in that building. The blood is still there, the DNA is still there. The shards of glass are still there, the books and all the coursework, it's still out there on the desks as if the kids just went out for a fire drill. It's all still there. And we wanted to walk people through so that they could receive the lessons of why something like this happened. And a day of mass carnage, leading to 17 dead and 17 injured, but not only why it happened [but also] what kinds of things can we do to stop the next one.

And I said, \"I'd really like you all to come.\" This was scheduled to be a three-hour day. She was here, not three hours, [but] almost five. Because she wanted to know about those we lost. She wanted to know about the work that we're doing. Today was an incredibly consequential, meaningful day. ABC NEWS LIVE: You told me that this building is going to be demolished. GUTTENBERG: Yeah. ABC NEWS LIVE: And that this was sort of the final chapter. GUTTENBERG: The final lesson. ABC NEWS LIVE: The final lesson. GUTTENBERG: Yeah.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images ABC NEWS LIVE: What do you believe needs to be done? We know that the president signed the most comprehensive gun safety legislation into law in decades. But still, that did not go as far as the president and the vice president were hoping. GUTTENBERG: I wish we could have gone further. And I hope people vote in the next election to ensure we get to go further. But it went, and it got a lot of things done. I'll give you this. I'll just tell you this, for the first time in months, the homicide rate related to gun violence, for the first time in years, is trending down. I was just at the FBI facility in West Virginia, where they conduct threat assessment and background checks last month. And they're doing the new enhanced under 21 background checks which are a part of that legislation. And they were talking about the abundance of young people now that they've been able to stop from getting a weapon because of that new enhanced under-21 background check.

ABC NEWS LIVE: I do want to ask you about your daughter and just what we should know about her and how you have been able to cope with the loss of a daughter so young. GUTTENBERG: My daughter will forever be the toughest person I ever knew. And if you saw the way she died on the third floor, running down the hallway for her life, because she got locked out of a room \u2013 knowing there was a shooter at her back with an AR-15. And she made it to within 1 second of her life, turning into the stairwell. It does not surprise me that she was fighting for her life that way. She's the toughest person I've ever known. I get through every day because she stands on my shoulders pushing me forward. I get through every day because I know no matter how hard this fight is, I will never ever, ever have anything as hard as what she did running down that hallway. I am her voice now. My daughter was 14 when she was killed. Forever 14. She should be 20 now. And I have a dream now of ending gun violence in America and I'm dedicating my life to it.

And for me, it's something I'll never ever get over, I'll never comprehend how it was possible. I'll never forgive those who failed to deal with the reality of gun violence, because we were listening to too many of the wrong people. And I will do everything I can to ensure we fire every single elected person who continues to fail on this issue. All I want to do is stop the next one. Fred Guttenberg, a father of a victim of the 2018 Parkland shooting, speaks with ABC News. ABC News ABC NEWS LIVE: We are now in a critical election year. What do you want Americans to know heading into this election year? GUTTENBERG: What I want America to know is there is only one president and vice presidential candidate \u2013 they're the ones running for re-election, President [Joe] Biden and Vice President Harris, who stand for doing something about gun violence So here's what I want America to know. This is not an election to sit home. If you're any of the many people across this country who think I'm gonna stay home on my couch, I don't need to vote. Yes, you do. Let me be clear: If there's anybody in your life that you love, and because of that, you want to reduce gun violence, you know how to vote and you know you need to vote.",

            "content": "On Nov. 30, 2021, a 15-year-old boy killed four students and injured seven others in a shooting spree at Oxford High School in Michigan. He pleaded guilty to all 24 charges against him and was sentenced to life in prison. Just three days after the shooting, Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald made the historic decision to charge the shooter's parents, Jennifer and James Crumbley, with involuntary manslaughter. The Crumbleys are the first parents ever to be charged, then convicted, in the United States for a mass shooting committed by their child. In a new hourlong documentary premiering April 18 on Hulu, \"Sins of the Parents: The Crumbley Trials,\" ABC News Studios offers exclusive behind-the-scenes access as the prosecution builds their case over a two-year period. In this Feb. 8, 2022, file photo, Jennifer Crumbley, left, and James Crumbley, right, the parents of Ethan Crumbley, a teenager accused of killing four students in a shooting at Oxford High School in Oxford, Mich., appear in court for a preliminary examination on involuntary manslaughter charges in Rochester Hills, Mich. Paul Sancya/AP, FILE \"I know we have a legal duty as parents to protect other people from dangerous kids,\" McDonald says in the documentary. \"This is about parents who largely ignored their son, neglected\u2026his cries for help. And then bought him a gun,\" said chief assistant prosecutor David Williams. MORE: Jennifer and James Crumbley, parents of Michigan school shooter, sentenced to 10 to 15 years for manslaughter The shooter's journal entries revealed that he blamed his parents for his mental decline, stating that they didn't listen or get him a therapist. During the trials, evidence showed how the Crumbleys were engaged with their son's interest in guns. While investigating Ethan's parents, McDonald and her team uncovered a text message sent by Jennifer Crumbley to her son. The text read, \"LOL, I'm not mad. You have to learn how not to get caught.\" Jennifer Crumbley did not appear to be angry with him after learning that he had been researching bullets in class. Testifying in her own defense, Jennifer Crumbley said, \"You know, as a parent, you spend your whole life trying to protect your child from other dangers. You never would think you have to protect your child from harming somebody else.\" James Crumbley's defense attorney, Mariell Lehman, warned that the prosecution's argument could set a dangerous precedent, blurring the line between parent and criminal. \"I think that if somebody is made out to be a bad parent, then\u2026their behavior can be contorted into criminal behavior,\" Lehman says. \"I think that James Crumbley was\u2026made out to be someone that he's not.\" A jailhouse phone call with James Crumbley is one of several which the prosecution has said were threatening against the Oakland County prosecutor. \"When I get out of here, I am f------ on a rampage, Karen. Yes, Karen McDonald, your a-- is going down and you better be f------ scared.\" Crumbley's defense attorney characterized those remarks as venting, noting that some statements were from years before the trial began. The Crumbleys were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 10-15 years in prison. After the trial, Judge Cheryl Matthews said the Crumbleys showed a lack of concern toward guns and glorified their possession and use. The story about parents who ignored their son's cries for help and bought him a gun started on Nov. 26, 2021, at an Oxford gun store. James Crumbley purchased a Sig Sauer 9-mm. handgun with his son. Entries from the child's journal revealed he had been wanting his parents to buy him a gun. That same day, he posted on Instagram that he had received his \"new beauty today,\" Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams said. The next day, he went to the gun range with his mother, and surveillance footage captured him showing her how to use the firearm. Two days later, a teacher caught him researching ammunition and left a voicemail for Jennifer Crumbley expressing concerns. \"I'm calling from Oxford High School,\" the voicemail said. \"One of the teachers had sent an email to the office because she was concerned. He was on his phone looking at bullets.\" Jennifer Crumbley was initially concerned when she texted her son about the disturbing voicemail she had just listened to, evidence presented by the prosecution showed. After he downplayed the situation, she reassured him she wasn't angry and advised him to be more careful. On Nov. 30, 2021, he turned in math homework that included drawings. The school's counselor texted what they felt were disturbing drawings to Jennifer Crumbley and called her to come into the school. She responded, saying she couldn't come in. After the conversation, Jennifer Crumbley texted her husband James about the situation. She told him she was concerned, and James Crumbley responded that he was very concerned after seeing his son's drawings. VIDEO: Parents to be sentenced for son's school shooting ABCNews.com \"Eventually, they both came in,\" Marc Keast, Oakland County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, said. \"The school counselor told them, I think you need to get him services. You need to take him home. And both Jennifer Crumbley and James Crumbley said they couldn't do it. They're being told by a school counselor that this is suicidal ideation.\" Jennifer Crumbley's lawyer, Shannon Smith, challenged this after Jennifer Crumbley told her on the stand that the school counselor told he didn\u2019t believe her son was harmful. \u201cHe told us that he didn't feel my son was a risk and actually gave him the option if he wanted to stay at school or go home,\u201d Jennifer Crumbley said. \u201cMy son wanted to stay at school. And then I said, I'm going to go back to work.\u201d Prosecutors said during the trial that neither Jennifer nor James Crumbley mentioned to the counselor that they bought him a gun four days earlier, and they did nothing to look for it. Approximately 90 minutes later, their son shot and killed Hana St. Juliana, 14, Tate Myre, 16, and Madisyn Baldwin and Justin Shilling, both 17, and injured seven others. After the shooter's actions gained widespread attention, McDonald's investigation shifted from him to his parents once it was discovered where he obtained the gun. \"As soon as I heard that they were called to the school that day,\" McDonald said, \"the messages about \" \u2018LOL don't get caught.\u2019\" Those were very, very concerning to me. And so, when they presented the case on the shooter, I addressed that: 'What about the parents?'\" During a press conference, McDonald stated, \"It is egregious that a parent could read those words and know that their son had access to a deadly weapon that they gave him. It is unconscionable, and I think it is criminal.\" \"When you get down to the actual elements, their big defense has been that they locked their weapon,\" McDonald said. \"First, they went to the substation and were asked at least two or three times where the weapon was, and they never said it was locked.\" James Crumbley told the police that he had hidden an unloaded gun in his bedroom armoire. Based off evidence that was presented to the jury, Jennifer Crumbley was the last adult to have possession of the gun, and the video of her walking out of the shooting range with the gun is the last known evidence of its whereabouts prior to the shooting. The jury found her guilty based on this key factor, as stated by the jury's forewoman to the media. MORE: Parents of Michigan shooting victims speak before James, Jennifer Crumbley sentenced for son's attack Jennifer Crumbley was found guilty on Feb. 6, 2024, on all four counts of involuntary manslaughter. As soon as Jennifer Crumbley's trial ended, James Crumbley's trial started. His defense was different from Jennifer Crumbley's due to him making the 911 call that his gun was missing and having no knowledge of his obtained access to a gun he had hidden. \"It boils down to reasonable foreseeability and whether or not James had knowledge of what his son was capable of or what his son was planning,\" defense attorney Mariell Lehman said. \"He had no knowledge that his son had obtained access to the firearms that James thought he had responsibly hidden and prevented his son from having access to.\" McDonald and her team focused on how James Crumbley was not shocked that his son obtained the gun. \"When you think about what he knew about the gun, about his son, and then he sees that drawing, what do you do?\u201d Williams asked. \"And any responsible person is going to do a couple of things. They're going to ask him what's going on, and they would look at that drawing and say, my God, that's the same gun we just bought him.\" A month later, James Crumbley was also found guilty on all four counts of involuntary manslaughter. \"No amount of years in prison is going to make their grief or pain any less,\" McDonald said. \"It's not going to bring anybody back.\"",

So that's what we were teaching. You get in small group of people, we first started with four, you first four go immediately. Then it cut down to one- and two-man's response to the active shooter.

            "content": "On April 20, 1999, a tragedy in our schools changed them forever. Two students, who created a plan for mayhem, launched a devastating attack inside a school \u2013 once considered a safe and protected space \u2013 the likes of which our nation and the world had never seen before. The plot, well-planned, was focused on one thing: killing. The end result was twelve murdered students and one murdered teacher, all within a school that, prior to the attack, was far removed from the kind of violence typically perceived to be associated with larger cities, but that now occurred in the Denver, Colorado suburb of Columbine. The Columbine school attack sent a shockwave around our nation and the world. Schools, faculty, students, parents, and the law enforcement community were deeply shaken. These \"safe spaces\" were now considered a target for violent behavior, and no one readily understood why. This dangerous new dynamic triggered a sea change in school safety and security that we are still dealing with today. Police stand outside the east entrance of Columbine High shool as bomb squads and SWAT teams secure students, April 20, 1999, in Littleton, Colo., after two masked teens on a \"suicide mission\" stormed the school and blasted fellow students with guns and explosives before turning the weapons on themselves. Mark Leffingwell/AFP via Getty Images One of those changes was the deeper involvement of the federal government in school safety. Congress passed a multitude of laws to try to address this new school threat, including schools being designated part of the nation's critical infrastructure in 2011. In January 2013, Congress passed a landmark law called the Investigate Assistance for Violent Crimes Act , which empowered the federal government, if requested by state law enforcement officials, to task various government agencies to \"assist in the investigation of violent acts and shootings occurring in a place of public use and in the investigation of mass killings and attempted mass killings,\" including schools. Why was this law passed? Another school shooting occurred just one month earlier, this time at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. I had the opportunity to visit the scene at Sandy Hook Elementary School during President Obama's visit in the aftermath. The attack devastated the local community, which lost 20 first-grade students and six school staffers to yet another act of seemingly inexplicable gun violence. At the time, one of my own children was in first grade. This horrendous attack shocked the nation to its core and many, especially in law enforcement, myself included, wanted to help. Police check the scene at the aftermath of a school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Dec. 14, 2012. Don Emmert/AFP via Getty Images That tragedy, and the passage of the Investigate Assistance for Violent Crimes Act, compelled every federal agency to act, including the U.S. Secret Service, for which I worked at the time. As an agency within the Department of Homeland Security with a focus on the prevention of targeted violence, both the Secret Service and I found ourselves in the center in what was, and continues to be, an attack on our schools. MORE: School shooting survivors share their stories, from Columbine to Oxford High As part of the federal response, the most valuable things the Secret Service brought to the table from its decades of tracking and preventing deadly violence against political figures was its expertise in preventing targeted violence and ensuring physical security, both of which could help schools put in place better practices and protocols to make them safer. Prior to Columbine, school shootings and attacks were a relatively unknown occurrence. The most notorious was the University of Texas at Austin tower shooting in 1966, in which 14 people were murdered by a sniper and 31 injured. More recently, schools across the nation saw a drastic increase in gun violence following pandemic school closures. So far in 2024, as of this writing, there have been 18 reported shootings at K-12 schools in the U.S., resulting in eight deaths and 21 people injured, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive . The statistics can be misleading, however, since the motives behind such shootings are largely unclassified \u2013 they could be the result of gang violence, criminal activity, or other reasons, as opposed to a school and its occupants being specifically targeted, as was the case at Columbine. An officer walks outside of Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, May 24, 2022. An 18-year-old gunman killed 14 children and a teacher at an elementary school in Texas according to the state's governor, in the nation's deadliest school shooting in years. Allison Dinner/AFP via Getty Images Even prior to the passage of the Investigate Assistance for Violent Crimes Act, the Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) had been working on preventing school violence. The groundbreaking 2002 study , titled \"The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative: Implications for the Prevention of School Attacks in the United States,\" sought to answer the questions of why these acts were happening and how to identify them, and to propose methods by which to mitigate them via the threat assessment process. MORE: 25 years after Columbine, survivors say they're still haunted by the attack That NTAC report helped identify some precursor behavioral patterns that could be used to identify and potentially mitigate acts of targeted violence in schools. It included 10 key points to that end: \u2022 Incidents of targeted violence at school rarely were sudden, impulsive acts. \u2022 Prior to most incidents, other people knew about the attacker's ideas and/or plans to attack. \u2022 Most attackers did not threaten their targets directly prior to advancing the attack. \u2022 There is no accurate or useful \"profile\" of students who engaged in targeted school violence.

Moreover, many had considered or attempted suicide. Many attackers felt bullied, persecuted or injured by others prior to the attack. \u2022 Most attackers had access to weapons, and had used weapons prior to the attack. \u2022 In many cases, other students were involved in the attack in some capacity. \u2022 Despite prompt law enforcement responses, most shooting incidents were stopped by means other than law enforcement intervention. Through the Department of Homeland Security, the Secret Service began to conduct presentations for schools, law enforcement officers and parents around the nation about how to identify these behavioral patterns, and mitigate the pathways to an attack.

The answer is that we don't have enough evidence to say it's safe, and in fact, there is growing evidence that social media use is associated with harm to young people's mental health,\" said U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy last year. \"Children are exposed to harmful content on social media, ranging from violent and sexual content, to bullying and harassment. And for too many children, social media use is compromising their sleep and valuable in-person time with family and friends,\" Murthy added. \"We are in the middle of a national youth mental health crisis, and I am concerned that social media is an important driver of that crisis \u2013 one that we must urgently address.\" Yet social media has been and continues to be almost universally used by students \u2013 and many parents remain cyber and social media ignorant. A makeshift memorial in remembrance of 13 victims killed during a school shooting at Columbine High School. Steve Liss/Getty Images Due to the accessibility and use of social and online media, Columbine-inspired attacks are a concern on this, the 25th anniversary of the shootings. The January 2024 Perry High School shooting in Perry, Iowa, and the March 2023 shootings at Nashville's Covenant School were committed by people later believed to have been at least partly inspired by Columbine, based on social media and other online activity. And despite the creation of a school safety website resource page within the Department of Homeland Security, we watched in horror as 19 students and two teachers were fatally shot, and 17 more injured, by a former student at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, which exposed the ongoing flaws in school safety, security, and proper response. School dynamics have changed, and educators and administrators deal with more challenges than ever before, every day. But as a poll taken just months after the Robb Elementary School shooting shows, parents' concern for their children's safety at school is higher now than it's been in more than 20 years. Which is why \u2013 with my children still in school, the advocacy of my spouse and with a grave concern for our nation's schools' safety \u2013 I drew upon my Secret Service training and took a job as a security coordinator in a local school district. That job has placed me in the line of sight of all the safety issues impacting schools, many of which continue to evolve, leaving many educators without the proper training to handle them. Donald J.

            "content": "After four days of jury selection, Donald Trump has a full jury in his New York criminal hush money trial , where he's facing felony charges related to a 2016 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Judge Juan Merchan swore in five additional alternate jurors on Friday and scheduled opening statements for Monday. MORE: Trump hush money trial updates: Judge sets opening statements for Monday Tensions ran high in the courtroom at times Friday, as defense attorneys attempted to grill potential witnesses about their social media histories and opinions on the former president. Two potential jurors broke down to tears during questioning, telling the judge they were too anxious about the case to serve as fair jurors. Both were excused. Here are four big takeaways from the fourth day of the historic trial: Alternate jurors sworn in Five additional alternate jurors were sworn in to hear the case on Friday. \"We have now completed jury selection for this case,\" Judge Merchan said. The alternate jurors are five women and one man. Below is a breakdown of all the alternates: Alternate Juror No. 1: Female, Analyst for Asset Manager Alternate Juror No. 2: Female, Unemployed Alternate Juror No. 3: Male, Audio Professional Alternate Juror No. 4: Female, Contract Specialist Alternate Juror No. 5: Female, Creative Operations for Clothing Company Alternate Juror No. 6: Female, Project Manager for Construction Company Judge denies Trump's request for emergency stay An appeals court judge denied the defense's request for an emergency stay of the trial on Friday. Trump earlier Friday filed the emergency appeal as he sought to change the venue of the trial based on some of the responses prospective jurors gave during the jury selection process. The appeals court judge denied Trump's request to delay the start of the trial. Judge won't order prosecutors to disclose 1st witness Judge Juan Merchan declined to order prosecutors to disclose their first witness after defense attorneys remade a request from yesterday. \"I still think that under the circumstances, the people's response is understandable, and I am not going to compel them to do anything,\" Merchan said, citing a hearing set for Tuesday to hold Trump in contempt for violating the judge's limited gag order. On Thursday, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump might attack the initial witnesses if he learned their names. Today, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass offered a compromise -- that they would turn over the first witness's name on Sunday with a strict condition. \"If that should be tweeted, that will be the last time we extend that courtesy,\" Steinglass said. Steinglass said that while the testimony of the first witness will likely begin on Monday, it is unlikely the witness finishes their direct examination by the end of the day. Prospective alternates voice varied opinions of Trump Many of the prospective alternates spoke freely about their opinions of former President Trump during individual questioning by defense attorney Susan Necheles. As the former president looked on, one man said there were many categories to Trump: \"He's a family man. He's a businessman,\" the man said. \"Clearly he has brought a lot of value to the economy.\" But he said his opinion was split over Trump himself. \"I really like lower taxes in this country. I like lower regulation,\" the man said. \"When I think about the Republican Party and why we bring religion and women's rights with their own bodies,\" that's where he said he splits from Trump, concluding his impression is both \"neutral and positive.\" Former President Donald Trump speaks to the media after leaving the courtroom for the day at Manhattan Criminal Court during his trial for allegedly covering up hush money payments, on April 19, 2024, in New York. Spencer Platt, POOL via Reuters Another man conceded he posted online a handful of times about Trump in 2016 and \"around the time of the insurrection.\" Asked for his impression of Trump, he responded, \"I'd say it's fairly negative.\" \"You continue to hold that opinion of a strong dislike?\" Necheles asked him. \"Based on his rhetoric,\" the man answered, though he declared himself open-minded. \"What is your opinion?\" Necheles asked another prospective alternate, the management consultant who likes the outdoors. \"I think we are not in agreement with a lot of policies. But it's also something that I've had to take a step back and really talk to a lot of people who are close to me that he has connected with,\" he responded. \"You need to take both sides.\" Trump reiterates his plans to testify Trump reiterated his plans to testify in his criminal trial as he exited the courtroom at the end of the day. \"We just had another hearing and the trial starts on Monday, which is long before a lot of people thought,\" he said. \"The judge wants to go as fast as possible.\" The former president again, without evidence, called the trial a witch hunt orchestrated by his political rivals.",

            "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel -- The head of Israeli military intelligence resigned on Monday over the failures surrounding Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7 attack, the military said, becoming the first senior figure to step down over his role in the deadliest assault in Israel's history. Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva's decision could set the stage for more resignations among Israel's top security brass over Hamas' attack, when militants blasted through Israel's border defenses, rampaged through Israeli communities unchallenged for hours and killed 1,200 people, most civilians, while taking roughly 250 hostages into Gaza. That attack set off the war against Hamas in Gaza, now in its seventh month. \u201cThe intelligence directorate under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with. I carry that black day with me ever since, day after day, night after night. I will carry the horrible pain of the war with me forever,\u201d Haliva wrote in his resignation letter, which was provided by the military. Haliva, as well as other military and security leaders, were widely expected to resign in response to the glaring failures that led up to Oct. 7 and the scale of that attack's ferocity. But the timing of the resignations has been unclear because Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza and battling the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the north. Tensions with Iran are also at a high following attacks between the two enemies. Some military experts have said resignations at a time when Israel is engaged on multiple fronts is irresponsible and could be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Shortly after the attack, Haliva had publicly said that he shouldered blame for not preventing the assault as the head of the military department responsible for providing the government and the military with intelligence warnings and daily alerts. While Haliva and others have accepted blame for failing to stop the attack, others have stopped short, most notably Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said he will answer tough questions about his role but has not outright acknowledged direct responsibility for allowing the attack to unfold. He has also not indicated that he will step down, although a growing protest movement is demanding election s be held soon. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid welcomed the resignation, saying it was \u201cjustified and dignified.\u201d \u201cIt would be appropriate for Prime Minister Netanyahu to do the same,\u201d he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The Hamas attack, which came on a Jewish holiday, caught Israel and its vaunted security establishment entirely off guard. Israelis' sense of faith in their military \u2014 seen by most Jews as one of the country's most trustworthy institutions \u2014 was shattered in the face of Hamas' onslaught. The resignation could help restore some of that trust. The resignation came as Jews around the world prepared to celebrate Passover, a weeklong holiday that begins Monday evening and marks the biblical exodus of Jews from slavery in Egypt. With roughly 130 people still held captive in Gaza, Passover is certain to take on a more somber hue this year: for many Israelis, it\u2019s hard to fathom a celebration of freedom when dozens of people are still being held hostage. Hamas' attack set off the devastating war that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the local health ministry. The ministry's count doesn't distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, but it says at least two-thirds of the dead are children and women. The fighting has devastated Gaza\u2019s two largest cities, and driven 80% of the territory\u2019s population to flee to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave. The war has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe that has drawn warnings of imminent famine. The attack also sent shock waves through the region. Beyond Hezbollah and Iran, tensions have rocked the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as well as cities and towns within Israel itself.

            "date": "2024-04-16 17:54:00",
            "content": "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s once most powerful drug lord, Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n is claiming he cannot get phone calls or visits in the maximum security U.S. prison where he is serving a life sentence. Guzm\u00e1n, who in the past was able to break out of Mexican prisons seemingly at will, wrote a letter to District Court Judge Brian M. Cogan in the Eastern District of New York in late March, complaining that he hadn\u2019t been able to speak with his twin daughters. He was convicted for running an industrial-scale drug smuggling operation and is serving his sentence at a maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado. In May 2023, \"the facility stopped giving me calls with my daughters. And I haven\u2019t had calls with them for seven months,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n wrote. \u201cI have asked when they are going to give me a call with my daughters and the staff here told me that the FBI agent who monitors the calls does not answer. That\u2019s all they\u2019ve told me.\u201d \u201cIt is unprecedented discrimination against me,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n complained. \u201cThey have decided to punish me by not letting me talk to my daughters.\u201d Guzm\u00e1n also asked the judge to authorize a visit by his wife, Emma Coronel, but did not say when he was last allowed to see her. Coronel also pleaded guilty to drug charges in 2021 but was later released. \u201cI ask that you please authorize her to visit me and to bring my daughters to visit me, since my daughters can only visit me when they are on school break, since they are studying in Mexico ,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n wrote. Cogan responded last week, saying that once Guzm\u00e1n was convicted, all arrangements are in the hands of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, and that he had no power to intervene. In his reply, Cogan also said that after his conviction, \u201cthe Bureau of Prisons became solely responsible\u201d for the conditions of Guzm\u00e1n's confinement and that the judge cannot change them. \u201cAccordingly, his request must be denied,\u201d the judge said. The letters were filed by the court to the case file, which is accessible to the public. In December, Guzm\u00e1n's 95-year-old mother died in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa. She apparently had not seen her son since he was sent to the prison in Colorado. Lawyers for Guzm\u00e1n's family did not respond to messages requesting comment.. Guzm\u00e1n led the Sinaloa cartel in bloody drug turf battles that claimed the lives of thousands of Mexicans. He escaped twice from Mexican prisons, once through a mile-long tunnel dug running from his cell. After he was extradited to New York, his three-month trial included tales of grisly killings, political payoffs, cocaine hidden in jalapeno cans and jewel-encrusted guns. There is also a chance he may one day see his son in prison. In 2023, Mexico extradited one of his many sons, Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, to the United States to face drug trafficking, money laundering and other charges. The younger Guzm\u00e1n is believed to have led the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s push to produce and export fentanyl to the United States, where it has been blamed for about 70,000 overdose deaths annually.",

Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, in Braunau am Inn. After lengthy wrangling over the future of the house where he was born, work started last year on turning it into a police station \u2014 a project meant to make it unattractive as a pilgrimage site for people who glorify Hitler.

They posed in front of the house for photos and one of the women gave the stiff-armed Hitler salute. Patrolling officers noticed the group and took them to a police station for questioning. The woman said that she hadn't meant the salute seriously, but officers said they found a chat with the others on her cellphone in which they shared Nazi-themed messages and pictures. Police said they were reporting all four to prosecutors on suspicion of violating the Austrian law that bans the symbols of Nazism.",

            "title": "Iran's supreme leader tacitly acknowledges that Tehran hit little in its attack on Israel",
            "date": "2024-04-21 08:56:00",
            "content": "JERUSALEM -- Iran's supreme leader on Sunday dismissed any discussion of whether Tehran's unprecedented drone-and-missile attack on Israel hit anything there, a tacit acknowledgment that despite launching a major assault, few projectiles actually made it through to their targets. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's comments before senior military leaders didn't touch on the apparent Israeli retaliatory strike on Friday on the central city of Isfahan, even though air defenses opened fire and Iran grounded commercial flights across much of the country. Analysts believe both Iran and Israel, regional archrivals locked in a shadow war for years, are trying to dial back tensions following a series of escalatory attacks between them as the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip rages on and inflames the wider region. Khamenei, 85, made the comments in a meeting attended by the top ranks of Iran's regular military, police and paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, a powerful force within its Shiite theocracy. \u201cDebates by the other party about how many missiles were fired, how many of them hit the target and how many didn\u2019t, these are of secondary importance,\" Khamenei said in remarks aired by state television. \u201cThe main issue is the emergence of the Iranian nation and Iranian military\u2019s will in an important international arena. This is what matters.\u201d Iran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles that sought to overwhelm Israel's air defenses in the April 13 attack \u2014 the first on Israel by a foreign power since Iraq i dictator Saddam Hussein launched Scud missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War. However, Israeli air defenses and fighter jets, backed by the U.S., the United Kingdom and neighboring Jordan, shot down the vast majority of the incoming fire. Satellite images analyzed Saturday by The Associated Press showed the Iranian attack caused only minor damage at the Nevatim air base in southern Israel, including taking a chunk out of a taxiway that Israel quickly repaired. Iran's attack came in response to a suspected Israeli strike on April 1 targeting a consular building next to the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria , which killed two Guard generals and others. \u201cToday, thanks to the work done by our armed forces, the Revolutionary Guard, the army, the police, each in its own way, praise be to Allah the image of the country around the world has become commendable,\" added Khamenei, despite Iran facing public anger over its economy and crackdowns on dissent. In other developments, Iraqi security forces in the western Nineveh province area were searching for \u201coutlaw elements\u201d who fired missiles across the border into Syria late Sunday, targeting a base for U.S.-led coalition forces, Iraq's Security Media Cell said. The searchers had found and destroyed a missile launcher, the statement added. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the reported attack. Maj. Gen. Tahseen al-Khafaji, head of the Security Media Cell, said about five missiles were launched across the border but it was unclear if they had hit or caused any damage at the targeted base. U.S. officials did not comment on whether any U.S. facility had been specifically targeted. One official said a coalition fighter destroyed a launcher in self-defense after reports of a failed rocket attack near a coalition base at Rumalyn, Syria. No U.S. personnel were injured, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that were not yet public. Two nights earlier, an explosion struck a base in Iraq belonging to the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of Iran-allied militias, killing one person and injuring eight. Militia officials initially described the explosion at the Kalsu military base north of Babylon as an airstrike that they blamed on U.S. forces. The U.S. Central Command denied it had carried out any airstrikes in Iraq, and Iraq\u2019s Security Media Cell said the country\u2019s air defense command had not detected any drones or war planes in near Babylon before or during the explosion. The PMF is designated as an \u201cindependent military formation\u201d within the Iraqi armed forces. In recent months, some of the coalition's member groups have staged attacks on U.S. forces based in the region, which they said was in retaliation for Washington\u2019s support of Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza. Those attacks halted after three U.S. soldiers were killed in a strike on a base in Jordan, near the Syrian border in late January, prompting U.S. retaliatory strikes in Iraq. ___ Associated Press writer Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.",

            "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A woman accused of serving her ex-husband\u2019s parents and an aunt poisonous mushrooms with lunch appeared in an Australian court on Monday charged with three counts of murder and five of attempted murder. Erin Patterson, 49, appeared briefly in the Latrobe Valley Magistrates Court by video link from a Melbourne prison where she has been held since she was arrested in November last year. Magistrate Tim Walsh said he would announce on May 7 whether Patterson will face a committal hearing in the same court in Morwell or in Melbourne. Morwell is a rural town near Patterson\u2019s home about 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of Melbourne, the Victoria state capital. Committal hearings determine whether prosecutors have sufficient evidence to put charges before a jury in a Victorian Supreme Court trial. It was Patterson\u2019s second court appearance on the charges. She has yet to enter any pleas and has not applied to be released on bail. She is accused of killing her former parents-in-law, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, and Gail Patterson\u2019s sister, Heather Wilkinson, 66. All three died in a hospital days after consuming a meal at Patterson\u2019s home in July last year. She is also accused of the attempted murder of her ex-husband, Simon Patterson, at that lunch and on three previous occasions dating back to 2021. Simon Patterson did not accept an invitation to attend the lunch. She also is charged with the attempted murder of Wilkinson\u2019s husband, Ian Wilkinson, 68. Ian Wilkinson spent seven weeks in a hospital following the lunch. Police say the symptoms of the four sickened family members were consistent with poisoning from wild Amanita phalloides, known as death cap mushrooms. The potential maximum sentence in Victoria for murder is life imprisonment, and for attempted murder is 25 years in prison. Patterson appeared in court on Monday wearing a blue prison sweater. Walsh asked if Patterson could hear at the outset of the hearing, and she replied, \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Her lawyer, Colin Mandy, said his client wanted the committal hearing held in Morwell, even if that meant a delay until next year. \u201cIf it happens next year, then Ms. Patterson\u2019s content to wait for that,\u201d Mandy told the magistrate. Mandy said she wanted the hearing to take place close to her home. Defense lawyers have provided prosecutors with a list of anticipated witnesses to be called at the committal. Mandy said he expected the hearing would last three weeks.",

            "date": "2024-04-17 14:19:00",
            "content": "SAN SALVADOR -- El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele released the father of a Salvadoran soccer player from prison after the athlete published a plea for his release on social media, authorities confirmed on Wednesday. Marcelo \u201cEl Chiky\u201d D\u00edaz, who plays for El Salvador's national team, on Tuesday published a letter on X, formerly Twitter , saying his father was wrongfully arrested by police as a suspected gang member on the way to see him play on March 30. D\u00edaz pleaded directly to Bukele, who has a firm clench on power after being reelected in February despite a constitutional ban on reelection. \u201cOn behalf of him, myself and our entire family, we ask you from the bottom of our hearts to amend this mistake and that my father can return home, to his routine, to his work and with his family,\u201d wrote the player, who assured that his father is a man who has never had problems with the law. The arrest of D\u00edaz's father is part of a larger gang crackdown in the Central American nation that has gained Bukele a soaring popularity but has also fueled accusations of mass human rights abuses. Following a wave of gang violence two years ago, Bukele in March 2022 announced a \u201cstate of emergency,\u201d suspending many key constitutional rights and locking up nearly 80,000 people \u2014 more than 1% of the El Salvador's population \u2014 the government said were suspected as being part of a gang. People are often arrested with little evidence of gang ties and locked up in prisons likened to torture chambers with little access to due process. In January, Bukele's vice president F\u00e9lix Ulloa told the Associated Press that the government had \u201cmade mistakes\u201d in arresting people who committed no crimes. He said around 7,000 people arrested under the state of emergency had since been released from prisons. Relatives often go years without seeing their loved ones, but on Wednesday \u2014 one day after the soccer player posted the letter on social media \u2014 authorities confirmed his father was set free. \u201cThanks to everyone, but mainly to God for being a God of justice,\" D\u00edaz wrote Wednesday on X. \u201cMy father is home. He is well, he is healthy, he has been well treated. My solidarity with all the families who are going through similar situations.\u201d While authorities issued no statement on the release, the incident appears to fall in line with Bukele's larger strategy as he seeks recognition on an international level. While he has been heavily criticized by human rights groups and other international leaders, the self-described \u201cworld's coolest dictator\u201d has harnessed social media to speak to his base. He has turned to celebrities, sports and entertainment events in what experts and critics say is an attempt to change the narrative about his presidency. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

            "date": "2024-04-21 09:19:00",
            "content": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrived in Cambodia on Sunday for a three-day official visit to reaffirm ties with Beijing\u2019s closest ally in Southeast Asia. His visit is the last stop on a three-nation regional swing that also took him to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. He is visiting amid foreign concerns about two big Chinese-funded projects in Cambodia \u2014 a planned canal and a naval base \u2014 that critics allege could aid Beijing\u2019s strategic military interests in Southeast Asia. China is Cambodia\u2019s most important ally and benefactor, with strong influence in its economy. That is illustrated by numerous Chinese-funded projects \u2014 particularly infrastructure, including airports and roads, but also private projects such as hotels, casinos and property development. More than 40% of Cambodia\u2019s $10 billion in foreign debt is owed to China . Wang is scheduled to have separate meetings with Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father, Hun Sen, now serving as president of the Senate after serving for 38 years as Cambodia\u2019s head of government until he stepped down last year to be succeeded by his son. Wang was also granted a royal audience with King Norodom Sihamoni. Hun Manet has shown no sign of deviating from his father\u2019s pro-Beijing foreign policy. In August 2023, Wang visited Cambodia just days after Hun Sen announced he would step down as prime minister in favor of his eldest son. Beijing\u2019s support allows Cambodia to disregard Western concerns about its poor record on human and political rights, and in turn Cambodia generally supports Beijing\u2019s positions on foreign policy issues such as its territorial claims in the South China Sea. Cambodia has recently reiterated its determination to go ahead with the Chinese-financed 180-kilometer (112-mile) long, $1.7 billion Funan Techo Canal project across four provinces in the southern part of the country to connect the capital, Phnom Penh, to the Gulf of Thailand. The plan has raised concern from neighboring Vietnam , where some scholars speculated the 100-meter (330-foot) -wide and 5.4 meter (18-foot) -deep canal could make it easier for China to send military forces southward, close to Vietnam\u2019s southern coast. There are often frosty relations between Vietnam and its massive northern neighbor China, which aggressively claims maritime territory claimed by Hanoi and in 1979 staged a brief invasion. The United States has also weighed in on the project, appealing for transparency on the part of Cambodia's government. Wesley Holzer, a U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Phnom Penh, was quoted as telling the Voice of America that \u201cthe Cambodian people, along with people in neighboring countries and the broader region, would benefit from transparency on any major undertaking with potential implications for regional water management, agricultural sustainability, and security,\u201d Hun Manet, speaking Thursday to government officials and villagers in southern Takeo province, dismissed the Vietnamese concern and vowed to push forward with the project, which he said would provide a huge benefit to Cambodia. China also is involved with another project causing foreign concern, its Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand , which the United States and some international security analysts say is destined to serve as a strategic outpost for Beijing\u2019s navy. The Ream base initially attracted attention in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30 years' use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships. Hun Sen in response repeatedly denied there was such an agreement, pointing out that Cambodia\u2019s constitution does not allow foreign military bases to be established on its soil and declaring that visiting ships from all nations are welcome. The base is situated on the Gulf of Thailand, adjacent to the South China Sea, where China has aggressively asserted its claim to virtually the entire strategic waterway. The U.S. has refused to recognize China\u2019s sweeping claims and routinely conducts military maneuvers there to reinforce its status as international waters. On Dec. 7, two Chinese naval vessels became the first ships to dock at a new pier at the base, coinciding with an official visit to Cambodia by China\u2019s top defense official.",

Lake Tanganyika's rising waters have invaded the port of Bujumbura, Burundi's economic capital, disrupting business there and elsewhere in the country that relies heavily on donor support to run government programs. \"We are issuing this statement to ask our development partners to combine efforts with the state of Burundi to help all people affected by these disasters,\" Interior Minister Martin Niteretse said April 17. \"We need that support.\u201d Between September and April 7, some 203,944 people were affected by flooding, with 19,250 homes and 209 classrooms destroyed. The number of people internally displaced by flooding rose by 25%, reaching over 98,000, according to Violet Kenyana Kakyomya, the U.N. resident coordinator in Burundi. Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries, with 80% of its 13 million people employed in agriculture, according to the World Bank. Flooding there has created surreal scenes like game rangers entering the waterlogged Rusizi National Park in a canoe. The Boulevard du Japon, a major highway in Bujumbura, has been flooded in recent days. Climate experts say flooding in Burundi and elsewhere in the region is part of extreme conditions linked to the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. \u201cIt must be said directly that these floods are associated with climate changes that affect Burundi like other countries in the region,\u201d said Jean Marie Sabushimike, a geographer and disaster management expert who teaches at the University of Burundi. While climate change is the trigger, the impact of the flooding is exacerbated by poor land-use planning \u201cthat does not take into account areas at very high risk of flooding,\u201d he said. The rising waters of Lake Tanganyika have caused the Kanyosha river to overflow, damaging homes and other property in Bujumbura. Some in the city have been unable to return to their homes \u2014 or leave.

Meanwhile, in Kenya 35 people have died since mid-March in flooding events that have affected more than 100,000 people, according to the U.N., which cites Red Cross figures in the most recent update. Some residential areas in Nairobi, the capital, flooded as rivers broke their banks Sunday night. The Kenyan government agency in charge of roads warned Nairobi residents to avoid flooded highways, including one to the coastal city of Mombasa. Those who live by the Nairobi river were urged to move to higher ground. Flooding and mudslides have also been reported in western Kenya. In the northern region, a passenger bus was swept away by floodwaters on a bridge earlier in April, with disaster avoided after 51 passengers were rescued. Kenya's meteorology department predicts that rainfall will peak this week. __ Musambi reported from Nairobi, Kenya.",

            "date": "2024-04-18 01:24:00",
            "content": "TOKYO -- The United States ambassador to the United Nations said Thursday that America will stand with Japan until all the Japanese abducted by North Korea decades ago return home to end their painful separation. Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the comments on Thursday as she began her visit to Tokyo by meeting with the families of those kidnapped. Japan says North Korea abducted at least 17 Japanese citizens, possibly many more, to train them as agents during the 1970s and 1980s. After admitting in 2002 it had abducted 13 Japanese, North Korea apologized and allowed five to return home for a visit. They have since stayed in Japan. Pyongyang said eight others had died and denied that the other four entered its territory and never provided a reinvestigation it has promised. The twelve who are still missing include teenage students and others living along Japan\u2019s coasts. Many were bundled into small boats and taken across the sea to North Korea. \u201cThe United Stats stands with all the families, with all of Japan and with the international community in pressing for a resolution that will allow all families separated by the regime\u2019s policies to be reunited,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said at the outset of her meeting with five relatives of the abductees and a representative from their support group at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. \u201cI\u2019m all too familiar with the pain and the loss and the suffering that you family members here are experiencing,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how painful it is for you, and then how long you have had to endure this pain.\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said she has worked on North Korea-related issues throughout her career. U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is committed to raising the abduction issue \u201cat every opportunity and calling for the return of abducted Japanese citizens to their family,\u201d the ambassador said, adding that America sticks to that policy regardless of the leadership. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has repeatedly stated his determination to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to achieve the return of the abductees. Experts say Kim wants improved ties with Japan to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies, while Kishida, stung by a major corruption scandal in his governing party, wants to use possible progress in the abduction issue to turn around his dwindling support ratings at home. They say a summit, however, would be difficult because Japan cannot accept the preconditions set by Pyongyang in order to resolve the abduction issues. Sakie Yokota, 88, whose then-13-year-old daughter, Megumi, was abducted in 1977 from Japan\u2019s northern coast on her way home from school, told Thomas-Greenfield that she, her husband and Megumi\u2019s brothers searched for her for 20 years until they found out she was abducted. They are still waiting to reunite with her, she said. \u201cAll I want is to see her, while I\u2019m still well,\u201d Yokota said, beseeching the ambassador for continued support toward resolving the problem. Thomas-Greenfield arrived in Tokyo after her earlier visit to Seoul, where she and South Korean officials discussed a new mechanism for monitoring North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Russia and China have thwarted U.S.-led efforts to step up U.N. sanctions on North Korea over its ballistic missile testing since 2022, underscoring a deepening divide between permanent Security Council members over Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine . The United States, South Korea and Japan have been deepening security ties amid growing tensions in the region from North Korea and China.

The limited strike was believed to show Iran that Israel has the ability to cause real damage, but at the same time not provoke Iran. Iran called the Israeli strike a dramatic exaggeration by the media. In a meeting at the United Nations, Iranian Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian said \"the downed micro-aerial vehicle did not cause any financial or life damage.\" The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed not damage was done to the Natanz nuclear facility. Shuki Friedman of the Jewish People Policy Institute, a former head of the Iran sanctions program for the Israeli prime minister's office, likened the strike to Israel sending Iran a \"text message.\" \"Israel sent the message that 'we can reach anywhere,'\" and to \"demonstrate capabilities of a much more meaningful attack,\" Friedman said.

AFP via Getty Images Mick Mulroy, a former deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East and an ABC News national security and defense contributor, agreed the attack was carefully calibrated. \"I believe the Israeli's are determined to show Iran that it could target a sensitive facility in Iran, but did so in a manner not to provoke a response,\" he said Related Stories Israel, Iran play down apparent Israeli strike. The muted responses could calm tensions -- for now Apr 18, 9:55 PM G7 ministers eye targeted sanctions on Iran and a message of restraint for Israel at Italy meeting Apr 17, 12:31 AM NATO and the EU urge G7 nations to step up air defense for Ukraine and expand Iran sanctions Apr 18, 5:37 AM \"They also with the notable exception of their national security minister chose not to publicly discuss (the incident) as that would of been counterproductive to trying to contain and deescalate the situation,\" Mulroy added. The U.S. appeared to be doing the same. At the Pentagon, aides on Thursday were teleworking or declared themselves busy with no plans to brief reporters. The State Department, too, was quiet. Such a slow pace can be typical in Washington for a Friday, as staffers eye the exits for an early weekend. But the quiet hallways were noteworthy, given that a close U.S. ally had just launched a direct attack on Iran and no comment was to be found. At the White House, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, who briefed reporters at length throughout the week, was not at the podium for the daily press briefing. When pressed by reporters about whether declining comment was part of an administration strategy to de-escalate, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would say she was going to be \u201csuper mindful\u201d in her remarks. \u201cI understand the interest and I'm going to be disappointing many people here. This afternoon, I just don't have anything to share,\u201d she said. She added that \u201cmore generally,\u201d the U.S. has been clear \u201cwe do not want to see this conflict escalate.\u201d One U.S. official who declined to discuss any detailed offered this assessment of the unusual silence so long as they were granted anonymity: \"In the end, we're trying to stop a war here.\" ABC's Matt Gutman contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 09:48:00",
            "content": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South Africa's ruling African National Congress lost a second court case against a new rival party fronted by former President Jacob Zuma on Monday. A judge in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in the eastern city of Durban dismissed the ANC's case alleging copyright infringement against the MK Party for using a name and a logo the ANC claims ownership of. The MK Party was formed late last year and was given added importance ahead of a national election in May when former ANC leader Zuma joined. MK takes its full name \u2014 uMkhonto weSizwe \u2014 from the now-disbanded military wing set up by the ANC and Nelson Mandela in the 1960s. The MK Party's logo showing a man holding a spear and a shield is similar to the old military wing's logo. The ANC's request for payment in the form of royalties or damages from MK was rejected. The ANC has governed South Africa for 30 years since the first democratic elections following the end of the apartheid system of racial segregation in 1994. But it is under increasing pressure from voters over the country's deep problems, which include record levels of unemployment, worsening poverty, high rates of violent crime, government corruption and an electricity crisis. Analysts say the ANC will likely lose its majority for the first time in the May 29 election. Zuma's MK Party is among a group of challengers expected to erode its vote. The ANC lost another case against MK and the national electoral body last month after claiming the new party was not properly registered and should be disqualified from the election. That case was dismissed by a separate court. Zuma, 82, has made a contentious return to politics since losing the support of the ANC and being forced to step down as president of Africa's most advanced economy in 2018 amid allegations of corruption. He was initially barred from standing as a candidate in this year's election because of his criminal record for a contempt of court conviction in 2021, but he won an appeal against that. He is also currently on trial for corruption, although that case has been bogged down in delays for two years. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

            "date": "2024-04-22 08:43:00",
            "content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia\u2019s top court on Monday rejected appeals lodged by two losing presidential candidates who are demanding a revote, alleging widespread irregularities and fraud at the February polls. The 5-to-3 majority decision by the eight-judge panel of the Constitutional Court rejected the arguments, saying the legal teams of the losing candidates had failed to prove allegations that Prabowo Subianto\u2019s victory was the result of widespread fraud. The Court \u201crejects the petitioner\u2019s appeal entirely,\u201d Constitutional Court Chief Justice Suhartoyo said Monday, after a panel of eight judges took a marathon six hours to publicly read its reasoning in turn on both separate appeals. The verdict cannot be appealed. The General Elections Commission, known as KPU, had certified a landslide victory for president-elect Subianto, but his rivals, former Jakarta Gov. Anies Baswedan and former Central Java Gov. Ganjar Pranowo alleged that the victory had depended on large-scale fraud and widespread state interference. They also alleged nepotism, challenging the candidacy of outgoing President Joko Widodo\u2019s eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as Subianto's running mate. Baswedan and Pranowo argued that Raka, 37, should have been disqualified because the minimum age for candidates is 40, and they asked the court to bar him from a revote. Before the election , Raka was granted a controversial exception to that requirement by the Constitutional Court, which was then led by Anwar Usman, Widodo\u2019s brother-in-law. Usman was later forced to resign as chief justice for failing to recuse himself. The case was decided by eight justices instead of the full nine-member court because Usman, who is still on the court as an associate justice, was required to recuse himself. Subianto, the current defense minister, won the election with 58.6% of the votes, or more than 96 million ballots \u2014 more than twice the number received by each of the two runners-up, according to the KPU. The losing candidates accused Widodo of widespread abuse of power, saying he used officials at every level, ranging from cabinet members to village heads, and state policies such as social aid programs, to provide support for Subianto and Raka. Indonesian presidents are expected to remain neutral in elections to succeed them. Baswedan and Pranowo\u2019s legal challenges complained that hefty social aid from the government was disbursed in the middle of the campaign \u2014 far more than the amounts spent during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and Widodo distributed funds in person in a number of provinces. But the top court dismissed the charges, saying it was not convinced that the president had intervened to change the requirements for candidates in favor of his son and that he did not commit nepotism when he approved and supported his son\u2019s candidacy for vice president. \u201cA position obtained through general elections cannot be qualified as a form of nepotism,\u201d judge Arief Hidayat said. The court found that there was no proof that Widodo and his administration bent laws and norms to support Subianto. The decision was widely expected after four Indonesian Cabinet members testified in the court in April 5, that no rules were violated in the distribution of government aid. However, in a dissenting opinion, judge Saldi Isra said it was impossible to deny that social assistance was disbursed in the middle of the campaign for electoral purposes is impossible. \u201cI have a moral obligation to warn in order to anticipate and prevent a repetition of similar situations in the future,\u201d Isra said. Hundreds of protesters who had gathered near the court melted away as the broadcast of proceedings on a TV screen outside indicated their candidate\u2019s case was unsuccessful. Subianto, who was linked to human rights abuses during the authoritarian rule of Suharto, previously made four bids for the presidency and twice unsuccessfully challenged his losses to Widodo. His refusal to accept the results of the 2019 presidential election led to violence that left nine people dead in Jakarta. Widodo, the first Indonesian president from outside the Jakarta elite who is widely popular, will end his second and final term in office in October.",

Duda has previously spoken of Poland\u2019s openness to nuclear sharing within NATO.

            "content": "LONDON -- Two men, including one who was reported to be a parliamentary researcher, were charged with spying for China , British prosecutors said Monday. Police said Christopher Berry, 32, and Christopher Cash, 29, were charged with \u201cproviding prejudicial information to a foreign state, China.\" They will appear at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on Friday. Police allege the two men collected, recorded or communicated information \u201cprejudicial to the safety or interests of the state\u201d and violated the Official Secrets Act between late 2021 and February 2023. \u201cThis has been an extremely complex investigation into what are very serious allegations,\u201d said Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan Police counterterrorism command. Authorities did not release details about the two men. But Berry is reportedly an academic based in Oxfordshire, and The Sunday Times reported last year that Cash was a parliamentary researcher who held a pass that allows full access to the Parliament buildings, issued to lawmakers, staff and journalists after security vetting. The report said Cash worked with senior lawmakers from the governing Conservatives, including Alicia Kearns, who now heads the powerful Foreign Affairs Committee, and her predecessor in that role, Tom Tugendhat, who is now security minister. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said last year that he raised the issue with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, saying he raised \u201cvery strong concerns\u201d about interference in British democracy. At the time, Cash issued a statement through his lawyers maintaining his innocence. The Chinese Embassy issued a statement calling the allegations fabricated. Also on Monday, three people were arrested in Germany on suspicion of spying for China and arranging to transfer information on technology with potential military uses. British intelligence authorities have ratcheted up their warnings about Beijing's covert activities in recent years. In 2022, the head of the MI5 domestic intelligence agency, Ken McCallum, named China, Russia and Iran as the leading security threats to the U.K. He said that Chinese authorities' attempts to shape British politics included targeting and influencing a range of people in politics, including those early in their political careers. Last month, several British lawmakers, including leading China critic and former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, told reporters they had long been subjected to attempted hacking and impersonation attempts by hackers linked to the Chinese government. The lawmakers were speaking as American and British authorities announced a new set of sanctions and criminal charges against hackers linked to the Chinese government who are accused of targeting a huge range of officials and corporations in a sweeping state-backed operation.",

The two regional rivals are NATO allies but have been at odds for decades over a series of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean and drilling rights in the Mediterranean, and have come to the brink of war three times in the last 50 years. A dispute over energy exploration rights in 2020 led to the two countries\u2019 warships facing off in the Mediterranean. Monday\u2019s meeting in the Defense Ministry in Athens was to discuss confidence-building measures, following a similar meeting in Ankara last November. The two countries have engaged in the confidence-building process on and off for years, trying to seek common ground on a series of lower-key issues as a means of improving ties. The meeting comes ahead of planned talks in Ankara on May 13 between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Tense ties have improved significantly over the past year, with Erdogan visiting Athens in December and signing a raft of trade, energy and education deals. But Mitsotakis\u2019 announcement last week that Greece will create two marine parks for the protection of sea mammals and birds \u2014 one in the Ionian Sea in western Greece and one in the central Aegean \u2014 has angered Turkey. Omer Celik, spokesman for Erdogan\u2019s ruling party, said last week that Ankara considers the creation of the marine parks \u201ca step that sabotages the normalization process\u201d in relations, and said Turkey would \u201cin no way allow actions toward the declaration of marine parks in the Aegean Sea.\u201d Mitsotakis, speaking last week after a meeting of European leaders in Brussels, expressed surprise at what he described as \u201cTurkey\u2019s totally unjustified reaction to an initiative which at the end of the day is of an environmental nature.\u201d The Greek prime minister said the recent improvement in relations between Greece and Turkey was \u201cundeniable and measurable,\u201d but that this did not mean Turkey had changed its positions on the delineation of maritime zones in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean. \u201cThese positions remain positions which are deeply problematic for our country,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cBut this does not prevent us from being able to talk, to create a general good climate and invest more in a positive agenda and less in the issues which divide us and over which we clearly disagree.\u201d Turkey\u2019s delegation at Monday\u2019s talks was led by Deputy Foreign Minister Burak Akcapar, while the Greek one was headed by Ambassador Theocharis Lalakos, Greece\u2019s Defense Ministry said.",

            "content": "TUNIS, Tunisia -- Jewish Tunisia ns who organize an annual pilgrimage to one of the world\u2019s oldest synagogues are planning a scaled-down event next month, citing concerns about security less than a year after a deadly shooting there shook their community. Thousands regularly make the journey to Djerba \u2014 the North African island where many of Tunisia\u2019s remaining 1,500 Jews reside \u2014 to celebrate the Jewish holiday Lag B\u2019Omer. But this year, the community has decided to limit them to the 26-century-old El-Ghriba synagogue instead of the island-wide events traditionally held. \u201cThose who come to visit are welcome and they can hold religious rituals, light a candle, inside the synagogue,\u201d Perez Trabelsi, the head of the island\u2019s Jewish community, told The Associated Press. The decision comes more than six months into the Israel-Hamas war, which has reverberated throughout the Middle East and North Africa, inciting mass street protests from Morocco to Iraq. In Tunisia, most of the protests have been peaceful but in October, demonstrators desecrated a synagogue in Al-Hammah on the mainland. The limits to the Lag B\u2019Omer pilgrimage are a blow to Djerba\u2019s tourism industry after it welcomed more than 7,000 people for the three-day event last year. Days after it concluded, a 30-year-old national guardsman killed five people at the El-Ghriba synagogue, sparking panic among the population and visitors. The shooting and the Israel-Hamas war are politically charged topics in the North African country. Trabelsi attributed the decision to limit this year's Lag B\u2019Omer festivities to security concerns over the shooting, not the war. He said the community didn't feel threatened, but noted that its leaders felt obliged to protect it. He praised Tunisian authorities for working to provide security for the event and in a statement on Friday underlined the significance of the pilgrimage: \u201cTunisia and Djerba will remain lands of tolerance, coexistence and peace.\" Similar questions have been raised about annual pilgrimages to Jewish sites in Morocco, historically home to North Africa\u2019s largest Jewish community. The International Federation of Moroccan Jews has called for canceling collective celebrations of the Mimouna holiday and avoiding festive events in public spaces, according to local media reports.",

            "content": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Two separate explosions from ordnance left over from Cambodia\u2019s decades of warfare killed five people and injured two others, the head of the country\u2019s demining agency said Monday. Some 4 million to 6 million land mines and other unexploded munitions are estimated to have littered Cambodia\u2019s countryside during almost three decades of war and disorder that ended in 1998. On Saturday, four members of a family in the northeastern province of Mondulkiri who had gone into the forest to collect resin were killed when a grenade exploded from a handheld B-41 rocket launcher believed to date from the 1980s, according to Heng Ratana, director general of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre. He said he did not know what set off the device, which also injured a 6-year-old girl and the mother in the same family. Heng Ratana also told The Associated Press that a 47-year-old man who was a dealer of sand used in construction was killed on Sunday in the southern city of Sihanoukville when a 105-mm artillery shell exploded. The director general was unable to provide further details. Despite a very active demining program, many dangerous munitions remain in place, posing a hazard to villagers. Cambodia reported 7,392 suspected hazardous areas totaling 681 square kilometers (263 square miles) as of the end of 2022, according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. There were 65,043 casualties, including 19,822 deaths, caused by land mines and other explosive remnants of war from January 1979 to February 2024, the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority said. There have been an average of 37 casualties a year recorded for 2021-2023, a sharp drop from when the mine removal programs were started. Cambodian deminers are among the world\u2019s most experienced, and several thousand have been sent in the past decade under U.N. auspices to work in Africa and the Middle East. Cambodia last year began training deminers from Ukraine, which also suffers from a high density of land mines and other unexploded munitions.",

A busy bridge reopened and police were allowed to enter the ruins. Firefighters scaled down their presence, with some remaining there protectively in case small pockets of fire reignite or walls tumble. Though some streets near the 400-year-old landmark were still blocked for traffic, drivers were able to reach the city\u2019s center via Knippel Bridge for the first time since the fire. \u201dNow we are at a stage where the police can come in and inspect some things,\u201d said Jakob Vedsted Andersen, head of the Greater Copenhagen Fire Department, adding that police quickly checked out wreckage after firefighters stabilized it. The cause of the fire was still unknown, Vedsted Andersen said. Tuesday's blaze destroyed more than half the building that was under renovation, toppling the green copper roof and the iconic dragon-tail spire. The most valuable paintings and items inside had been saved from the flames, and no one was injured. Many people came to see the ruins over the weekend. On Thursday, a large section of the outer wall of the building collapsed inwards. The following day, firefighters used giant shears on a crane to cut away dangling scaffolding but suffered a setback after a crane's shear attachment, used to cut through debris, fell into the ruins. It was later recovered. The blaze is believed to have started on the roof of the building, which had been wrapped up in scaffolding. The Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, dating back to 1615, and was headquartered there, has vowed repeatedly to rebuild the Old Stock Exchange. No decision has yet been made about who will finance the reconstruction, a project that would cost millions, if not billions of kroner (dollars) and take years. The exchange sits on the waterfront next to the Danish parliament. It is considered a leading example of the Dutch Renaissance architectural style in Denmark. The Chamber of Commerce moved into the building after Copenhagen\u2019s stock exchange left in 1974.",

            "content": "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong has long been a major producer and consumer of great food , and a great amount of plastic and Styrofoam to go with it. That\u2019s going to change as new legislation aiming to stop the sale and distribution of Styrofoam products and single-use plastic cutlery went into effect on Monday. Under the new law, single-use cutlery such as forks, spoons, straws and plates cannot be sold or distributed for both dine-in and takeaway customers. However, plastic food containers and cups can still be given out for takeaways. The regulation of disposable plastic tableware and other plastic products in Hong Kong aims to reduce their use at the source to cut down on pollution, Hong Kong\u2019s Environmental Protection Department said in an emailed response to The Associated Press. Restaurants were given a six-month grace period. A second phase of the ban, expected next year, will ban all single-use plastics including containers for both dine-in and takeaway. Many restaurants have already begun implementing the new measure. Kuen Fat Kitchen is a typical lunch stop for many people in Hong Kong. Even before the new law was introduced, it had already started to reduce the use of Styrofoam boxes. Owner Kitty Chan said the changes will mean higher costs. \u201cFor a single-use cutlery set, you might think it\u2019s just a small change, but switching the plastic spoon to a paper spoon doubles the cost for us. So, it\u2019s not so friendly to the business of the food and beverage industry,\u201d Chan added. Customers at Kuen Fat Kitchen have mixed feelings. Some don\u2019t want to face extra hassle when going out to eat if they are asked to bring their own containers and utensils. \u201cWhen I\u2019m at work, I only have an hour for lunch, and I need to eat efficiently. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s convenient for me to bring my own cutlery and do the washing up afterwards. It\u2019s not convenient and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said customer Darren Seng. Others recognized the environment al impacts of their dining-out habits. \u201cI think it's better for the environment,\u201d said resident Thomson Choi. Single-use plastic cutlery is the second-largest source of plastic waste after single-use plastic bags in Hong Kong, according to Greenpeace. Many businesses are changing to alternative plastics made of natural resources to comply with new rules, instead of improving their packaging, the organization added. Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam hopes that the new law will discourage the throwaway culture and promote reusables, instead of \u201cgreener\u201d disposables. \u201cAny kind of plastic ban policy should aim to influence the public to stay away from plastic. We should move on, and have a new approach,\u201d said Tam. \u201cBut we would like to remind the government that it should devote more resources to promote reusable instead of disposable. This is the way to solve the root of the problem.\u201d According to the latest figures by Hong Kong's government in 2022, the city disposed 11,128 tons of solid waste per day, among which plastics contributed 2,369 tons. Hong Kong is reliant on the city\u2019s three landfills to handle its waste, but they are expected to be filled up by around 2026, according to the government. The city plans to implement municipal solid waste charging from Aug. 1, but the logistics have yet to be worked out. It would compel individual homes, restaurants, and all businesses to pay for trash they throw away.",

            "content": "WARSAW, Poland -- Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk expressed satisfaction on Monday after a series of candidates supported by his party won weekend races for mayor. Candidates from his pro-European Union centrist Civic Coalition, or running with the party's backing, won in a series of cities in the second round of local election s held on Sunday, among them Krakow, Poznan, Wroclaw and Rzeszow. \u201cIt is very difficult to clearly say who won and who lost,\u201d Tusk said Monday. \u201cBut if we compare these results, especially in the most attractive places, on these attractive battlefields ... then I actually have reasons for satisfaction.\u201d \u201cLaw and Justice has simply disappeared in many places,\u201d Tusk added at a news conference, referring to the main opposition party. The results put Civic Coalition in a favorable position as the country looks next to elections to the European Parliament on June 9. Mayors were chosen in a total of 748 cities and towns where no single candidate won at least 50% of the vote during the first round on April 7. Candidates for Tusk\u2019s party also recaptured cities where they had not held power for many years, including Zielona Gora, Legnica and Torun. The local and regional elections were viewed as a test for Tusk's pro-European Union government four months after it took power at the national level. Sunday's second round strengthened the Tusk government's leverage in the cities, which should facilitate cooperation on development projects and allotment of EU funds. Tusk's allies also won in some places in the first round two weeks ago, including in Warsaw, where incumbent Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski was an easy victor. In the first round, the right-wing Law and Justice, prevailed on the level of regional assemblies in the country's 16 provinces, where it took 34.3% of the votes, while Tusk's Civic Coalition got 30.6%. Law and Justice governed on the national level from 2015-23. Tusk\u2019s socially liberal Civic Coalition traditionally has strong support in cities, while Law and Justice has a more solid base in conservative rural areas, particularly in eastern Poland. Civic Coalition is the largest group in a three-party coalition that governs the EU nation of 38 million people. The coalition is pro-European Union but otherwise spans a wide ideological spectrum with left-wing politicians in the Left party as well as conservatives in the Third Way.",

Lake Tanganyika's rising waters have invaded the port of Bujumbura, Burundi's economic capital, disrupting business there and elsewhere in the country that relies heavily on donor support to run government programs. \"We are issuing this statement to ask our development partners to combine efforts with the state of Burundi to help all people affected by these disasters,\" Interior Minister Martin Niteretse said April 17. \"We need that support.\u201d Between September and April 7, some 203,944 people were affected by flooding, with 19,250 homes and 209 classrooms destroyed. The number of people internally displaced by flooding rose by 25%, reaching over 98,000, according to Violet Kenyana Kakyomya, the U.N. resident coordinator in Burundi. Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries, with 80% of its 13 million people employed in agriculture, according to the World Bank. Flooding there has created surreal scenes like game rangers entering the waterlogged Rusizi National Park in a canoe. The Boulevard du Japon, a major highway in Bujumbura, has been flooded in recent days. Climate experts say flooding in Burundi and elsewhere in the region is part of extreme conditions linked to the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. \u201cIt must be said directly that these floods are associated with climate changes that affect Burundi like other countries in the region,\u201d said Jean Marie Sabushimike, a geographer and disaster management expert who teaches at the University of Burundi. While climate change is the trigger, the impact of the flooding is exacerbated by poor land-use planning \u201cthat does not take into account areas at very high risk of flooding,\u201d he said. The rising waters of Lake Tanganyika have caused the Kanyosha river to overflow, damaging homes and other property in Bujumbura. Some in the city have been unable to return to their homes \u2014 or leave. Joachim Ntirampeba, resident of the village of Gatumba near the Congo border, said that while he had witnessed many flooding events over the years, this time \u201cit\u2019s terrible.\" He said it's \u201cthe first time\u201d he's seen such heavy flooding. Meanwhile, in Kenya 35 people have died since mid-March in flooding events that have affected more than 100,000 people, according to the U.N., which cites Red Cross figures in the most recent update. Some residential areas in Nairobi, the capital, flooded as rivers broke their banks Sunday night. The Kenyan government agency in charge of roads warned Nairobi residents to avoid flooded highways, including one to the coastal city of Mombasa. Those who live by the Nairobi river were urged to move to higher ground. Flooding and mudslides have also been reported in western Kenya. In the northern region, a passenger bus was swept away by floodwaters on a bridge earlier in April, with disaster avoided after 51 passengers were rescued.

            "content": "LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged Monday that the first deportation flights carrying migrants who enter the country illegally to Rwanda would leave in 10-12 weeks, as he vowed to end the Parliamentary deadlock over a key policy promise before an election expected later this year. Sunak made the comments at a news conference where he demanded that the unelected House of Lords stop blocking legislation that would permit the deportation flights, a central part of the government's strategy to \u201cstop the boats\u201d carrying migrants across the English Channel illegally. The prime minister vowed that Parliament would remain in session until the legislation is passed. The House of Commons will take up the bill later in the day, followed by consideration in the House of Lords. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Sunak said, adding that commercial charter planes are booked to carry the asylum seekers to Rwanda. Illegal channel crossings are a potent political issue in Britain, where they are seen as evidence of the government's failure to control migration. The number of people arriving on small boats soared to 45,774 in 2022 from just 299 four years earlier. Small boat arrivals dropped to 29,437 last year as the government cracked down on people smugglers and reached an agreement to return Albanians to their home country. While Sunak acknowledged that he wouldn't meet his self-imposed deadline of getting the first deportation flights in the air this spring, he blamed the delays on continued resistance from the opposition Labour Party. His drive to finally push the legislation through Parliament comes less than two weeks before local elections that will be a key barometer of support for Sunak's Conservative Party, which is trailing in opinion polls. The prime minister declined to provide details about how many people were expected to be on the flights or exactly when they would take off because, he said, opponents are likely to continue to try to frustrate the policy. Migrant advocates have already said they plan to challenge the law in the European Court of Human Rights. \u201cWe are ready, plans are in place, and these flights will go come what may,\" Sunak said. \"No foreign court will stop us from getting flights off.\u201d The bill has been stalled for two months as it bounced back and forth between the two houses of Parliament, with the Lords repeatedly offering amendments that were then rejected by the Commons. The Lords don\u2019t have the power to kill the legislation, but they must give their assent before it can become law. The Conservative Party plans to send some migrants to Rwanda as a deterrent to persuade people that it isn\u2019t worth the risk of crossing the English Channel on leaky inflatable boats. The plan, pursued by three prime minsters over the past two years, has so far been stymied by a series of court rulings and vocal opposition from migrant advocates who say it is illegal and inhumane. The current legislation, known as the Safety of Rwanda Bill, is a response to a Supreme Court decision that blocked the deportation flights because the government couldn\u2019t guarantee the safety of migrants sent to Rwanda. After signing a new treaty with Rwanda to beef up protections for migrants, the government proposed the new legislation declaring Rwanda to be a safe country. Alex Carlile, an independent member of the House of Lords, said the amendments are designed to improve \u201cill-judged, badly drafted, inappropriate\u201d legislation that is \u201cillegal in current U.K. and international law.\u201d \u201cThis is, in my view, the most inexplicable and insensitive day I\u2019ve experienced in nearly 40 years in one or other house of Parliament,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWhat Rishi Sunak is asking Parliament to do is say that an untruth is a truth.\u201d ____ Follow AP\u2019s global migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

Prosecutors said the three German citizens are accused of having acted for Chinese intelligence since some point before June 2022. They are also suspected of violating German export laws by exporting a special laser without permission. One of the suspects, identified only as Thomas R. in line with German privacy laws, was allegedly an agent for an employee of China's Ministry of State Security and procured information in Germany on \u201cmilitarily usable innovative technologies\u201d for that person, federal prosecutors said in a statement. To do that, prosecutors said, he used Herwig F. and Ina. F, a couple who own a company in Duesseldorf that was used to contact and work with German researchers. The couple allegedly set up a research transfer agreement with an unidentified German university, the first step in which was to draw up a study for a Chinese partner on the technology of machine parts that could be used for powerful ship engines, including those in battleships. Thomas R.'s handler at the MSS was behind the Chinese partner and the project was financed by the Chinese state, prosecutors said. At the time of the arrests, the suspects were in negotiations on further research projects that could be useful for expanding China's naval combat strength, they added. The suspects also procured with MSS funding a special laser and exported it to China without permission, although it was classified as a \u201cdual-use\u201d instrument under European Union rules, prosecutors said. The homes and offices of the suspects, who were arrested in Duesseldorf and in Bad Homburg, near Frankfurt, were searched. The suspects were arrested a week after a three-day visit to China by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, his second since he took office in late 2021. German officials wouldn't be drawn on whether the government was aware of the case at the time but said the trip hadn't played any role in the timing of the arrests. In a strategy for relations with China released last year, the German government pointed to a \"systemic rivalry\u201d with the Asian power and a need to reduce risks of economic dependency, but highlighted its desire to work with Beijing on challenges such as climate change and maintain strong trade ties. The document stated that \u201cwe take decisive action to counter all analog and digital espionage and sabotage activities by Chinese intelligence services and state-controlled groups, whether these activities be in or directed against Germany.\u201d Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Monday's arrests were \u201ca great success for our counterespionage.\u201d \u201cWe are keeping an eye on the significant danger from Chinese espionage in business, industry and science,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe are watching these risks and threats very closely and have warned and sensitized people clearly so that protective measures can be stepped up everywhere.\u201d",

Harald fell ill in late February during a private holiday with his wife, Queen Sonja, on the Malaysian resort island of Langkawi. He received a temporary pacemaker there due to a low heart rate on March 2. Harald returned to Norway aboard a medical airplane and was immediately transferred to a hospital. He underwent a second surgey to receive a permanent pacemaker 10 days later at Oslo\u2019s university hospital. At first, he was expected to be on sick leave for two weeks, but that was extended several times. During that time, his 50-year-old son, Crown Prince Haakan, has been assuming the king\u2019s duties. Harald\u2019s duties as Norway\u2019s head of state are ceremonial and he holds no political power. He ascended to the throne following the death of his father, King Olav, in 1991.",

            "content": "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog said Monday that U.S. search giant Google must fix its advertising search restrictions affecting Yahoo in Japan . The Japan Fair Trade Commission said in a statement that its recent study of Google\u2019s practices showed it was undermining fair competition in the advertising market. Yahoo Japan Corp., which has since merged with the Japanese social media platform Line, began keyword-targeted search advertising services using Google's technology after the two companies formed a tie-up in 2010. The FTC alleges that Google had imposed restrictions in its search advertising agreement with Yahoo Japan that for more than seven years hindered its ability to compete in targeted search ads. An FTC investigation into whether that violated the Anti-Monopoly Law led Google to drop the restrictions. Google said in an emailed statement that it has cooperated fully with the commission's probe, and stressed the commission has not found it had outright violated anti-monopoly laws. It promised to carry out the commission's directives to offer \u201cvaluable\u201d search functions to Japanese users and advertisers. Line Yahoo declined comment. Google will be under review for the next three years, to ensure it carries out needed changes, the commission said. It did not impose any fines or other penalties on Google, which remains popular among Japanese. The commission\u2019s move follows another setback for Google in Japan. Last week, Japanese doctors filed a civil lawsuit against the company, demanding damages for what they claim are groundless derogatory and often false comments. The Tokyo District Court suit demands 1.4 million yen ($9,400) in damages for 63 medical professionals, for reviews posted on Google Maps. Google said in response that it's working \u201c24 hours a day\u201d to reduce misleading or false information on its platform, combining human and technological resources \u201cto delete fraudulent reviews.\u201d ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",

            "date": "2024-04-22 04:28:00",
            "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australia n judge on Monday ruled that social media platform X must block every user in the world from accessing video of a bishop being stabbed in a Sydney church, extending the prohibition beyond users in Australia. X Corp., the tech company rebranded by billionaire Elon Musk when he bought Twitter last year, announced last week it would fight in court Australian orders to take down posts relating to a knife attack on Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel in an Assyrian Orthodox church as a service was being streamed online on April 15. The material was geoblocked from Australia but remained available elsewhere. But the regulator that made the orders, Australia\u2019s eSafety Commission, which describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, successfully applied to the Federal Court in Sydney for a temporary global ban on the sharing of video of the bishop being stabbed. In an after-hours hearing, Justice Geoffrey Kennett suppressed the footage from all X users until Wednesday, when an application for a permanent ban will be heard. X has 24 hours to \u201chide\u201d the footage from users, the judge ruled. The regulator's lawyer, Stephen Tran, had argued that geoblocking Australia did not meet the definition of \u201cremoval\u201d of the footage under Australian law. Tran said the footage was a \u201cgraphic and violent video\u201d that would cause \u201cirreparable harm if it's continuing to circulate.\" X's lawyer Marcus Hoyne said he had been unable to get instructions from his San Francisco-based client because it was early Monday morning in the United States. Musk has described eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant as the \u201cAustralian censorship commissar.\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had earlier criticized X for refusing to remove graphic posts about the knife attack on a bishop and priest at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church. Albanese said social media posts, misinformation and dissemination of violent images had exacerbated suffering from the church attack, which the two clerics survived, as well as a knife attack at a Sydney shopping mall two days earlier which killed six people. \u201cSocial media has a social responsibility,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cI find it extraordinary that X chose not to comply and are trying to argue their case.\u201d The platform\u2019s Global Government Affairs team said on Saturday Inman Grant had ordered it to remove some posts that commented on the church attack, but it said the posts did not violate X\u2019s rules on violent speech. X said the Australian regulator had demanded the platform \u201cglobally withhold these posts or face a daily fine of $785,000.\u201d \u201cX believes that eSafety\u2019s order was not within the scope of Australian law and we complied with the directive pending a legal challenge,\u201d the Global Government Affairs account said. \u201cWhile X respects the right of a country to enforce its laws within its jurisdiction, the eSafety Commissioner does not have the authority to dictate what content X\u2019s users can see globally,\u201d it said. \u201cWe will robustly challenge this unlawful and dangerous approach in court,\u201d it added. The live feed of the church attack and social media posts that followed attracted a crowd of 2,000 people and fueled a riot against police, who barricaded the young suspected attacker inside the place of worship. The rioting injured 51 police officers and damaged 104 police vehicles, officials said. Three alleged rioters had been arrested by Sunday and police on Monday released images of 12 suspects they accuse of being the main instigators of the violence, taken from video of the riot. A 16-year-old boy accused of the stabbings has been charged with terrorism offenses. He has received online condemnation and praise for the attack.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines -- American and Filipino forces launched their largest combat exercises in years Monday in a show of allied firepower near the disputed South China Sea that has alarmed Beijing. The annual exercises by the longtime treaty allies will run until May 10 and involve more than 16,000 of their military personnel, along with more than 250 French and Australian forces. While the Philippine military maintains that the Balikatan \u2014 Tagalog for \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder\u201d \u2014 trainings are not directed at a particular country, some of their main conflict scenarios are set in or near the disputed South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine coast guard and accompanying ships have figured in a series of increasingly tense territorial faceoffs since last year. In encounters in disputed areas, Chinese coast guard vessels have resorting to water cannons, blocking and other dangerous maneuvers that have caused injuries to Philippine navy personnel and damaged supply boats. The Philippine military said a key focus of this year\u2019s drills is territorial defense. \u201cWe\u2019re dead serious about protecting our territory \u2014 that\u2019s why we do these Balikatan exercises,\u201d Col. Michael Logico, who speaks for the Philippine military on the combat drills, told The Associated Press. As the disputes between China and the Philippines have escalated, President Joe Biden and his administration has repeatedly warned that the United States is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if it is attacked. U.S. Marine Lt. Gen. William Jurney said in the ceremony that the large-scale military exercises will demonstrate that the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty between the U.S. and the Philippines \u201cis no mere piece of paper.\u201d Washington lays no claim to the contested waters but has declared that freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of the disputes are in its national interest. Philippine military chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner, who opened the exercises in a ceremony, said that as Pacific coastal nations, the United States and the Philippines \u201cunderstand the importance of maritime cooperation in addressing the complex challenges that threaten peace and security in our region.\u201d China strongly criticized the exercises, saying the Philippines was \u201cganging up\u201d with countries from outside Asia in an obvious reference to the United States and its security partners, and warned that the drills could instigate confrontation and undermine regional stability. The combat drills will include a joint sail by the U.S., Philippine and French navies in and near disputed waters off the western Philippine province of Palawan, the sinking of a mock enemy ship by combined U.S. and Philippine firepower, and the retaking of an occupied island off the northwestern Philippines, according to the Philippine military. China specifically opposed the transport of a U.S. ground-launched missile system to the northern Philippines ahead of the exercises. No missile would be fired but the aim was to build familiarity among military participants with the hi-tech weaponry in a tropical setting. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed China's grave concern over the deployment of the missile system \u201cat China's doorstep.\u201d \u201cThe U.S. move exacerbates tensions in the region and increases the risk of misjudgement and miscalculation,\u201d he said in response to a question in a news briefing in Beijing last week. \u201cThe Philippines needs to think twice about being a cat's paw for the U.S. at the expense of its security interests and stop sliding down the wrong path.\" The Biden administration has been strengthening an arc of alliances to better counter China, including in a possible confrontation over Taiwan , an island democracy that Beijing claims as its own. That dovetails with efforts by the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to defend its territorial interests by boosting joint military exercises with the U.S. He has also allowed rotating batches of American forces to stay in additional Philippine military camps under a 2014 defense pact, including in his country's north, which lies just a sea border away from Taiwan and southern China. ___ Associated Press journalist Iya Forbes in Manila contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 03:20:00",
            "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel -- The head of Israeli military intelligence resigned on Monday over the failures surrounding Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7 attack, the military said, becoming the first senior figure to step down over his role in the deadliest assault in Israel's history. Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva's decision could set the stage for more resignations among Israel's top security brass over Hamas' attack, when militants blasted through Israel's border defenses, rampaged through Israeli communities unchallenged for hours and killed 1,200 people, most civilians, while taking roughly 250 hostages into Gaza. That attack set off the war against Hamas in Gaza, now in its seventh month. \u201cThe intelligence directorate under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with. I carry that black day with me ever since, day after day, night after night. I will carry the horrible pain of the war with me forever,\u201d Haliva wrote in his resignation letter, which was provided by the military. Haliva, as well as other military and security leaders, were widely expected to resign in response to the glaring failures that led up to Oct. 7 and the scale of that attack's ferocity. But the timing of the resignations has been unclear because Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza and battling the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the north. Tensions with Iran are also at a high following attacks between the two enemies. Some military experts have said resignations at a time when Israel is engaged on multiple fronts is irresponsible and could be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Shortly after the attack, Haliva had publicly said that he shouldered blame for not preventing the assault as the head of the military department responsible for providing the government and the military with intelligence warnings and daily alerts. While Haliva and others have accepted blame for failing to stop the attack, others have stopped short, most notably Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said he will answer tough questions about his role but has not outright acknowledged direct responsibility for allowing the attack to unfold. He has also not indicated that he will step down, although a growing protest movement is demanding election s be held soon. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid welcomed the resignation, saying it was \u201cjustified and dignified.\u201d \u201cIt would be appropriate for Prime Minister Netanyahu to do the same,\u201d he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The Hamas attack, which came on a Jewish holiday, caught Israel and its vaunted security establishment entirely off guard. Israelis' sense of faith in their military \u2014 seen by most Jews as one of the country's most trustworthy institutions \u2014 was shattered in the face of Hamas' onslaught. The resignation could help restore some of that trust. The resignation came as Jews around the world prepared to celebrate Passover, a weeklong holiday that begins Monday evening and marks the biblical exodus of Jews from slavery in Egypt. With roughly 130 people still held captive in Gaza, Passover is certain to take on a more somber hue this year: for many Israelis, it\u2019s hard to fathom a celebration of freedom when dozens of people are still being held hostage. Hamas' attack set off the devastating war that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the local health ministry. The ministry's count doesn't distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, but it says at least two-thirds of the dead are children and women. The fighting has devastated Gaza\u2019s two largest cities, and driven 80% of the territory\u2019s population to flee to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave. The war has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe that has drawn warnings of imminent famine. The attack also sent shock waves through the region. Beyond Hezbollah and Iran, tensions have rocked the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as well as cities and towns within Israel itself. On Monday, Israeli police said that a car had slammed into pedestrians in Jerusalem, wounding three lightly, and security camera video showed two men exiting the car with a rifle before the fleeing the scene. Police later said they arrested the two men. ___ This story has been edited to correct the spelling of Maj. Gen.

            "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Papua New Guinea\u2019s Prime Minister James Marape accused Joe Biden of disparaging the South Pacific island nation by implying that an uncle of the U.S. president had been eaten by \u201ccannibals\u201d there during World War II. Biden\u2019s comments offended a key strategic ally as China moves to increase its influence in the region. The president spoke at a Pennsylvania war memorial last week about his Army Air Corps aviator uncle Second Lt. Ambrose J. Finnegan Jr., whom he said was shot down over Papua New Guinea, which was a theater of heavy fighting. \u201cThey never found the body because there used to be \u2014 there were a lot of cannibals for real in that part of New Guinea,\u201d Biden said, referring to the country\u2019s main island. Marape said in a statement on Sunday that Biden \u201cappeared to imply his uncle was eaten by cannibals.\u201d \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labeled as such,\u201d Marape said in a statement provided by his office to The Associated Press on Monday. \u201cWorld War II was not the doing of my people; however, they were needlessly dragged into a conflict that was not their doing,\u201d Marape added. The rift comes as Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began a visit on Monday to Papua New Guinea, Australia\u2019s nearest neighbor. Albanese and Marape will commemorate strong defense ties between the two countries by walking part of a pivotal battle ground known as the Kokoda Track later this week. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that PNG has no stronger partner than Australia and our defense and security ties have never been stronger,\u201d Albanese told reporters before departing Australia. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday Biden was speaking to the bravery of his uncle and the many U.S. service members that put their lives on the line. \u201cHe takes this very seriously. His uncle, who served and protected this country, lost his life serving. And that should matter,\u201d she said. Biden's account that Finnegan's plane was shot down was not supported by military records. Finnegan was a passenger on a Douglas A-20 Havoc transport plane that crashed into the ocean after both engines failed on May 14, 1944, according to a Pentagon report. One crew member survived but no trace was found of the plane or three other people on board, including Finnegan. Marape\u2019s statement was released on the same day he met China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Port Moresby to discuss building closer relations. Marape also called on the U.S. to find its war dead in Papua New Guinea\u2019s jungles and to clean up the wreckage of war. \u201cThe remains of WWII lie scattered all over PNG, including the plane that carried President Biden\u2019s uncle,\" Marape said. \u201cPerhaps, given President Biden\u2019s comments and the strong reaction from PNG and other parts of the world, it is time for the USA to find as many remains of World War II in PNG as possible, including those of servicemen who lost their lives like Ambrose Finnegan,\u201d he said. \u201cThe theaters of war in PNG and Solomon Islands are many, and littered with the remains of WWII including human remains, plane wrecks, ship wrecks, tunnels and bombs. Our people daily live with the fear of being killed by detonated bombs of WWII,\u201d Marape added.",

            "title": "Takeaways from AP report on how the search for the coronavirus origins turned toxic",
            "date": "2024-04-22 02:51:00",
            "content": "BEIJING -- The Chinese government froze meaningful efforts to trace the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, despite publicly declaring it supported an open scientific inquiry, an Associated Press investigation has found. The AP drew on thousands of pages of undisclosed emails and documents, leaked recordings, and dozens of interviews that showed the freeze began far earlier than previously known \u2014 in the first weeks of the outbreak \u2014 and involved political and scientific infighting in China as much as international finger-pointing. Crucial initial efforts were hindered by bureaucrats in Wuhan trying to avoid blame who misled the central government; the central government, which silenced Chinese scientists and subjected visiting U.N. officials to stage-managed tours; and the World Health Organization itself, which may have compromised early opportunities to gather critical information, according to internal materials obtained by AP. Secrecy clouds the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Even the date when Chinese authorities first started searching for the virus\u2019 origins is unclear. The first publicly known search for the coronavirus took place on Dec. 31, 2019, when Chinese Center for Disease Control scientists visited the Wuhan market where many early COVID-19 cases surfaced. But WHO officials heard of an earlier inspection of the market on Dec. 25, 2019, according to a recording of a confidential WHO meeting provided to the AP. In the recording, WHO\u2019s top virus expert, Peter Ben Embarek, told colleagues that Chinese officials that day were \u201clooking at what was on sale in the market, whether all the vendors have licenses (and) if there was any illegal (wildlife) trade.\u201d Ben Embarek said the probe was \u201cnot routine\u201d and WHO would \u201ctry to figure out what happened.\u201d Such a probe has never been publicly mentioned by Chinese authorities or WHO. WHO said in an email that it was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any investigation on Dec. 25, 2019. Other experts said any visit to the market that day would be significant, especially if animal samples were taken because they could be critical evidence of how COVID-19 jumped to humans. Zhang Yongzhen was the first scientist to publish a sequence of the COVID-19 virus. One day after he wrote a memo urging health authorities to act quickly, China\u2019s top health official ordered his lab closed. \u201cThey used their official power against me and our colleagues,\u201d Zhang wrote in an email provided to AP by Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist. Among Chinese doctors and scientists, the sense grew that Beijing was hunting for a scapegoat. The government opened investigations into top health officials, according to two former and current China CDC staff and three others familiar with the matter. China CDC staff were encouraged to report colleagues who mishandled the outbreak to the Communist Party\u2019s disciplinary bodies, according to two of the people. As criticism of China grew, the Chinese government deflected blame. Instead of firing health officials, they declared their virus response a success and closed investigations into the officials with few job losses. \u201cThere were no real reforms, because doing reforms means admitting fault,\u201d said a public health expert in contact with top Chinese health officials who asked that he not be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Early on, Chinese scientists were silenced and politicians took control. As WHO negotiated with China for a mission to investigate COVID-19 in early 2020, it was China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, not scientists, that decided the terms. China refused a visa for WHO\u2019s Ben Embarek, then the agency\u2019s top animal virus expert. The itinerary dropped nearly all the items linked to an origins search, according to draft agendas obtained by AP. Taking charge of the WHO visit was Liang Wannian, an epidemiologist close to top Chinese officials who was widely seen as pushing the party line, not science-backed policies, according to nine people familiar with the situation who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Liang also ordered the Wuhan market disinfected before samples could be collected and promoted an implausible theory that COVID-19 originated from frozen food imported into China. On a train ride with Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Liang lobbied the U.N. agency to praise China\u2019s response in its public report. The new section was so flattering that colleagues emailed Aylward to suggest he \u201cdial it back a bit.\u201d By the time WHO led another visit to Wuhan in January 2021, the origins hunt had become highly politicized. Liang, the Chinese official in charge of two earlier WHO visits, organized market workers to tell WHO experts no live wildlife was sold and cut recent photos of wildlife at the market from the report. The WHO team concluded a lab leak was \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d But just months later, WHO chief Tedros said it was \u201cpremature\u201d to dismiss the lab leak theory and pressed China to be more transparent, infuriating Chinese officials China told WHO any future missions to find the origins of COVID-19 should be elsewhere, according to a letter obtained by AP. Since then, global cooperation has ground to a halt. Chinese scientists are still under heavy pressure, according to 10 researchers, medical experts and health officials. Researchers who published papers on the coronavirus ran into trouble with Chinese authorities. Others were barred from travel abroad for conferences and WHO meetings. The head of the China CDC Institute of Viral Disease was forced to retire over the release of sensitive market data, according to a former China CDC official who declined to be named, fearing repercussions. \u201cIt has to do with the origins, so they\u2019re still worried,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf you try and get to the bottom of it, what if it turns out to be from China?\u201d ___ Cheng reported from Geneva.",

            "content": "Israeli police said they have arrested two people after a car slammed into pedestrians in Jerusalem on Monday, lightly wounding three. Footage taken by a CCTV camera and aired by Israeli media showed a car plowing into three ultra-Orthodox Jews, sending at least two flying over the dashboard. Palestinians have carried out periodic attacks on Israeli cities and towns since the country\u2019s war against Hamas began on Oct. 7. During that time, violence has surged in the West Bank. Also Monday, Palestinian civil defense in Gaza said it had found 283 bodies on the grounds of a Khan Younis hospital, and Israel's chief of military intelligence resigned over the failure to prevent the Oct. 7 attack, the first senior official to do so. The conflict, now in its seventh month, has sparked regional unrest pitting Israel and the U.S. against Iran and allied militant groups across the Middle East. Israel and Iran traded fire directly this month, raising fears of all-out war. The war was sparked by the unprecedented Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel in which Hamas and other militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 hostages. Israel says militants are still holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, at least two-thirds of them children and women. It has devastated Gaza\u2019s two largest cities and left a swath of destruction. Around 80% of the territory\u2019s population have fled to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave. The U.S. House of Representatives approved a $26 billion aid package on Saturday that includes around $9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza, which experts say is on the brink of famine, as well as billions for Israel. The U.S. Senate could pass the package as soon as Tuesday, and President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately Currently: \u2014 Israel's chief of military intelligence resigns, citing failure to prevent Oct. 7 attacks \u2014 Israeli strikes on Rafah kill 22, mostly children \u2014 A Palestinian baby in Gaza is born an orphan \u2014 Iran\u2019s supreme leader tacitly acknowledges that Tehran hit little in its attack on Israel \u2014 Israel and Iran\u2019s apparent strikes and counterstrikes give new insights into both militaries \u2014 Israeli leaders criticize expected U.S. sanctions against military unit in West Bank Here is the latest: CAIRO \u2014 The head of the World Health Organization on Monday called for safe passage for humanitarian aid missions throughout Gaza after an aid team failed to complete its most recent trip to hard-hit northern Gaza. United Nations agencies and aid groups say the ongoing hostilities, Israeli military restrictions on goods and the breakdown of order inside Gaza make it increasingly difficult to bring vital aid to much of the coastal enclave. WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement that a mission by the WHO and its partners on Saturday at Kamal Adwan and Awda hospitals in northern Gaza was only partly completed \u201cdue to severe delays at checkpoints and ongoing hostilities.\u201d \u201cAs a result, fuel and medical supplies did not reach Kamal Adwan, for the second time in the last seven days, and partners were also unable to assess needs at Awda to support restoration of services,\u201d he said. He said the team managed to evacuate four patients from Kamal Adwan, along with their caretakers, including a 9-year-old boy suffering from a head tumor. \u201cWe again call for compliance with international humanitarian law, including access to health care and humanitarian aid for civilians in desperate need of help.\u201d He also called for a cease-fire. Israel has isolated northern Gaza since the opening days of the ground offensive in late October after ordering its population to flee to the south. Tens of thousands of people remained there despite the flattening of entire neighborhoods and severe shortages of food and water. CAIRO \u2014 The Gaza Health Ministry said the bodies of 54 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 104 injured, it said Monday. That brings the overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war to at least 34,151, the ministry said. Another 77,084 have been injured, it said. The Health Ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies but has said that women and children make up most of those killed. The Israeli military says it has killed 12,000 militants, without providing evidence to back up the claim. CAIRO \u2014 The Palestinian civil defense in the Gaza Strip said Monday it had uncovered 283 bodies from a temporary burial ground inside the main hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. The burial area in the Nasser hospital was built when Israeli forces were besieging the facility last month. At the time, people were not able to bury the dead in a cemetery and dug graves in the hospital yard, the group said. In a statement, the department said a total of 283 bodies have been recovered from the hospital yard since Friday. The civil defense said some of the bodies were of people killed during the hospital siege. Others were killed when Israeli forces raided the hospital, also last month. After the military withdrew from Khan Younis earlier this month, residents have been returning to the site in search of the bodies of their loved ones with the aim of burying them in permanent graves elsewhere. Civil defense workers began recovering bodies from the cemetery more than a week after Israel\u2019s military withdrew its forces from the city. The International Committee of the Red Cross has given 1,500 body bags and protective gear to the civil defense to help dig up the cemetery and move the bodies, it said. Israel sent troops into Khan Younis in December, part of its blistering ground offensive that came in response to Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. JERUSALEM \u2014 Israelis were set to begin celebrating Passover, a holiday meant to symbolize freedom, on Monday, against the backdrop of a brutal war in Gaza and the continued captivity of over 100 hostages in the strip. Passover is a major Jewish holiday, celebrated over the course of a week, that commemorates the biblical story of the exodus of ancient Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Jews will gather for a meal, called a \u201cseder,\u201d on Monday night to read the Passover story aloud. In Israel, some prepared to leave chairs at the seder table empty to symbolize the captives remaining in Gaza. Of some 250 hostages captured during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, roughly 130 remain in captivity. Efforts to strike a deal to secure their return have stalled, and Israeli officials say at least 30 are now dead. Many Israelis also have friends or family members killed or wounded in the Hamas attack, which killed 1,200 across southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine celebrating Pesach, the freedom holiday, without my son,\u201d said Dalit Shtivi, whose son Idan Shtivi is being held hostage in Gaza. \u201cI\u2019m begging there will be a deal.\u201d In Jerusalem\u2019s ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim, families threw bread into small fires on the street and dunked dishes into cauldrons of boiling water. It\u2019s typical for observant Jews to cleanse their homes of \u201cchametz,\u201d or grains, before the start of passover to commemorate the unleavened bread the Jews ate in their flight from Egypt. JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli police say they have arrested two suspects believed to have rammed a car into a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem Monday morning, lightly wounding three. The police said the two suspects were found after fleeing the scene and hiding near a closed business. The Monday attack was the latest to strike Israeli cities and towns since the war against Hamas broke out on Oct. 7. Palestinians have during that time carried out a number of attacks against Israelis, some of them deadly. During that time, violence has also surged in the West Bank. TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 Israeli authorities said they had arrested a suspect in the killing of a 14-year-old Jewish West Bank settler. The teen\u2019s disappearance earlier this month sparked rampages by Israeli settlers in a number of Palestinian communities. At least one Palestinian man was killed, Palestinian health officials said, and dozens were injured in the rampages and in confrontations with the settlers. A joint statement Monday by the Israeli internal security agency, Shin Bet, Israeli police and the military said Ahmed Dawabsheh, 21, was arrested in an overnight raid in the Palestinian village of Duma. Duma was one of the areas where the settlers rampaged after 14-year-old Binyamin Achimair\u2019s disappearance. The developments were the latest tensions roiling the West Bank, which has seen surging violence since the war in Gaza began on Oct. 7. JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli police said a car slammed into pedestrians in Jerusalem on Monday, wounding three people lightly. The three were injured when a car ran them over in the neighborhood of Romema, northeast of the city center. Footage of the incident taken by a CCTV camera and aired by Israeli media showed a car plowing into three ultra-Orthodox Jews, sending at least two flying over the dashboard. Two people exit the car with a gun, and appear to attempt to shoot, but fumble with the gun before running out of the camera\u2019s view. Police said they were searching for the two attackers, who they said had exited the vehicle with a submachine gun and fled the scene. Palestinians have carried out a number of attacks in Israeli cities and towns, some of them deadly, since the war against Hamas broke out on Oct. 7.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 02:40:00",
            "content": "ISLAMABAD -- Iranian and Pakistani leaders vowed to strengthen economic and security cooperation in a meeting on Monday, as the two countries seek to smooth over a diplomatic rift. Their meeting was part of efforts by Islamabad and Tehran to mend ties which had been briefly strained in January when each carried out strikes in other's territory, targeting militants accused of attacking their own security forces. Iran\u2019s President Ebrahim Raisi and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharifin spoke to reporters after meeting at Sharif's office, hours after Raisi arrived in Islamabad for a three-day visit. Authorities have deployed hundreds of additional police and paramilitary forces to ensure security during the visit. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant violence in recent months, mostly blamed on Pakistani Taliban and insurgents targeting security forces in Pakistan and neighboring Iran. Sharif welcomed Raisi with an honor guard ceremony in front of the premier's office. According to a statement released by the premier\u2019s office, the two leaders discussed a range of bilateral issues and vowed to cooperate to fight terrorism, as well as jointly reiterating condemnations of Israel's war in Gaza. Sharif praised Iran\u2019s \u201cstrong stand on the issue of Palestine\u201d and said \u201cPakistan is also with the Palestinians.\u201d In his televised remarks, Raisi said that the killings by Israel in Gaza were being committed with the support of the United States and other Western countries. He criticized the international organizations, including the United Nations, saying \"they say they support human rights, but they proved that they are inefficient\u201d. He also vowed to boost what he called \u201cunacceptably\u201d meager bilateral trade and called for setting up more border markers. Pakistan and Iran set up the first such border market in southwestern Pakistan's Baluchistan province last year, promising to set up five more such markets under a 2012 agreement. The two leaders also signed eight cooperation agreements, according to Sharif's office. Authorities said the two sides also discussed the multi-billion gas pipeline project, on hold since 2014. The project \u2014 opposed by Washington for what it says is a violation of sanctions imposed on Tehran over its nuclear program \u2014 launched in 2013 to supply Iranian natural gas to energy-starved Pakistan. Iran says it has already completed the pipeline on its side of the border after investing $2 billion. Pakistan was supposed to finish construction on its territory by the end of 2014, but work stalled, leading to tensions between the two nations. The Iranian president is set to meet with his Pakistani counterpart Asil Ali Zardari who helped launch the pipeline project after travelling to Iran in 2013. He also met with Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar. The two discussed regional and global developments and \u201caffirmed commitment to peace and constructive dialogue for resolving regional challenges.\" Raisi is accompanied by his spouse and a high-level delegation. He plans to visit Karachi, the country's biggest city, and Lahore, where he will meet with the country's recently elected first female chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif. The visit comes after Iran's airstrike into Israel, which was in response to an Israeli strike in Syria that had killed two Iranian generals in a consular building. Pakistan is among the countries that has no diplomatic relations with Israel because of the issue of Palestinian statehood.",

            "title": "Toxic: How the search for the origins of COVID-19 turned politically poisonous",
            "date": "2024-04-22 02:36:00",
            "content": "BEIJING -- The hunt for the origins of COVID-19 has gone dark in China , the victim of political infighting after a series of stalled and thwarted attempts to find the source of the virus that killed millions and paralyzed the world for months. The Chinese government froze meaningful domestic and international efforts to trace the virus from the first weeks of the outbreak, despite statements supporting open scientific inquiry, an Associated Press investigation found. That pattern continues to this day, with labs closed, collaborations shattered, foreign scientists forced out and Chinese researchers barred from leaving the country. The investigation drew on thousands of pages of undisclosed emails and documents and dozens of interviews that showed the freeze began far earlier than previously known and involved political and scientific infighting in China as much as international finger-pointing. As early as Jan. 6, 2020, health officials in Beijing closed the lab of a Chinese scientist who sequenced the virus and barred researchers from working with him. Scientists warn the willful blindness over coronavirus \u2019 origins leaves the world vulnerable to another outbreak, potentially undermining pandemic treaty talks coordinated by the World Health Organization set to culminate in May. At the heart of the question is whether the virus jumped from an animal or came from a laboratory accident. A U.S. intelligence analysis says there is insufficient evidence to prove either theory, but the debate has further tainted relations between the U.S. and China. Unlike in the U.S., there is virtually no public debate in China about whether the virus came from nature or from a lab leak. In fact, there is little public discussion at all about the source of the disease, first detected in the central city of Wuhan. Crucial initial efforts were hampered by bureaucrats in Wuhan trying to avoid blame who misled the central government; the central government, which muzzled Chinese scientists and subjected visiting WHO officials to stage-managed tours; and the U.N. health agency itself, which may have compromised early opportunities to gather critical information in hopes that by placating China, scientists could gain more access, according to internal materials obtained by AP. In a faxed statement, China's Foreign Ministry defended China\u2019s handling of research into the origins, saying the country is open and transparent, shared data and research, and \u201cmade the greatest contribution to global origins research.\u201d The National Health Commission, China's top medical authority, said the country \u201cinvested huge manpower, material and financial resources\u201d and \u201chas not stopped looking for the origins of the coronavirus.\u201d It could have played out differently, as shown by the outbreak of SARS, a genetic relative of COVID-19, nearly 20 years ago. China initially hid infections then, but WHO complained swiftly and publicly. Ultimately, Beijing fired officials and made reforms. The U.N. agency soon found SARS likely jumped to humans from civet cats in southern China and international scientists later collaborated with their Chinese counterparts to pin down bats as SARS\u2019 natural reservoir. But different leaders of both China and WHO, China\u2019s quest for control of its researchers, and global tensions have all led to silence when it comes to searching for COVID-19\u2019s origins. Governments in Asia are pressuring scientists not to look for the virus for fear it could be traced inside their borders. Even without those complications, experts say identifying how outbreaks begin is incredibly challenging and that it\u2019s rare to know with certainty how some viruses begin spreading. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing how quickly the search for the origins of (COVID-19) escalated into politics,\u201d said Mark Woolhouse, a University of Edinburgh outbreak expert. \u201cNow this question may never be definitively answered.\u201d Secrecy clouds the beginning of the outbreak. Even the date when Chinese authorities first started searching for the origins is unclear. The first publicly known search for the virus took place on Dec. 31, 2019, when Chinese Center for Disease Control scientists visited the Wuhan market where many early COVID-19 cases surfaced. However, WHO officials heard of an earlier inspection of the market on Dec. 25, 2019, according to a recording of a confidential WHO meeting provided to AP by an attendee. Such a probe has never been mentioned publicly by either Chinese authorities or WHO. In the recording, WHO\u2019s top animal virus expert, Peter Ben Embarek, mentioned the earlier date, describing it as \u201can interesting detail.\u201d He told colleagues that officials were \u201clooking at what was on sale in the market, whether all the vendors have licenses (and) if there was any illegal (wildlife) trade happening in the market.\u201d A colleague asked Ben Embarek, who is no longer with WHO, if that seemed unusual. He responded that \u201cit was not routine,\u201d and that the Chinese \u201cmust have had some reason\u201d to investigate the market. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to figure out what happened and why they did that.\u201d Ben Embarek declined to comment. Another WHO staffer at the Geneva meeting in late January 2020 confirmed Ben Embarek\u2019s comments. The Associated Press could not confirm the search independently. It remains a mystery if it took place, what inspectors discovered, or whether they sampled live animals that might point to how COVID-19 emerged. A Dec. 25, 2019, inspection would have come when Wuhan authorities were aware of the mysterious disease. The day before, a local doctor sent a sample from an ill market vendor to get sequenced that turned out to contain COVID-19. Chatter about the unknown pneumonia was spreading in Wuhan\u2019s medical circles, according to one doctor and a relative of another who declined to be identified, fearing repercussions. A scientist in China when the outbreak occurred said they heard of a Dec. 25 inspection from collaborating virologists in the country. They declined to be named out of fear of retribution. WHO said in an email that it was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the Dec. 25 investigation. It is not included in the U.N. health agency\u2019s official COVID-19 timeline. When China CDC researchers from Beijing arrived on Jan. 1 to collect samples at the market, it had been ordered shut and was already being disinfected, destroying critical information about the virus. Gao Fu, then head of the China CDC, mentioned it to an American collaborator. \u201cHis complaint when I met him was that all the animals were gone,\u201d said Columbia University epidemiologist Ian Lipkin. Robert Garry, who studies viruses at Tulane University, said a Dec. 25 probe would be \u201chugely significant,\u201d given what is known about the virus and its spread. \u201cBeing able to swab it directly from the animal itself would be pretty convincing and nobody would be arguing\u201d about the origins of COVID-19, he said. But perhaps local officials simply feared for their jobs, with memories of firings after the 2003 SARS outbreak still vivid, said Ray Yip, the founding head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outpost in China. \u201cThey were trying to save their skin, hide the evidence,\u201d Yip said. The Wuhan government did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Another early victim was Zhang Yongzhen, the first scientist to publish a sequence of the virus. A day after he wrote a memo urging health authorities to action, China\u2019s top health official ordered Zhang\u2019s lab closed. \u201cThey used their official power against me and our colleagues,\u201d Zhang wrote in an email provided to AP by Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist. On Jan. 20, 2020, a WHO delegation arrived in Wuhan for a two-day mission. China did not approve a visit to the market, but they stopped by a China CDC lab to examine infection prevention and control\u202fprocedures, according to an internal WHO travel report. WHO\u2019s then-China representative, Dr. Gauden Galea, told colleagues in a private meeting that inquiries about COVID-19\u2019s origins went unanswered. By then, many Chinese were angry at their government. Among Chinese doctors and scientists, the sense grew that Beijing was hunting for someone to blame. \u201cThere are a few cadres who have performed poorly,\u201d Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in unusually harsh comments in February. \u201cSome dare not take responsibility, wait timidly for orders from above, and don\u2019t move without being pushed.\u201d The government opened investigations into top health officials, according to two former and current China CDC staff and three others familiar with the matter. Health officials were encouraged to report colleagues who mishandled the outbreak to Communist Party disciplinary bodies, according to two of the people. Some people both inside and outside China speculated about a laboratory leak. Those suspicious included right-wing American politicians, but also researchers close to WHO. The focus turned to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a high-level lab that experimented with some of the world\u2019s most dangerous viruses. In early February 2020, some of the West\u2019s leading scientists, headed by Dr. Jeremy Farrar, then at Britain\u2019s Wellcome Trust, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, then director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, banded together to assess the origins of the virus in calls, a Slack channel and emails. They drafted a paper suggesting a natural evolution, but even among themselves, they could not agree on the likeliest scenario. Some were alarmed by features they thought might indicate tinkering. \u201cThere have (been) suggestions that the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab,\u201d Holmes, the Australian virologist, who believed the virus originated in nature, wrote in a Feb. 7, 2020, email. \u201cI do a lot of work in China, and I can (assure) you that a lot of people there believe they are being lied to.\u201d American scientists close to researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology warned counterparts there to prepare. James LeDuc, head of a Texas lab, emailed his Wuhan colleague on Feb. 9, 2020, saying he\u2019d already been approached by U.S. officials. \u201cClearly addressing this will be essential, with any kind of documentation you might have,\u201d he wrote. The Chinese government was conducting its own secret investigation into the Wuhan Institute. Gao, the then-head of the China CDC, and another Chinese health expert revealed its existence in interviews months and years later. Both said the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing, which Holmes, the Australian virologist, also heard from another contact in China. But Gao said even he hadn't seen further details, and some experts suspect they may never be released. WHO started negotiations with China for a further visit with the virus origins in mind, but it was China\u2019s Foreign Ministry that decided the terms. Scientists were sidelined and politicians took control. China refused a visa for Ben Embarek, then WHO\u2019s top animal virus expert. The itinerary dropped nearly all items linked to an origins search, according to draft agendas for the trip obtained by the AP. And Gao, the then-head of the China CDC who is also a respected scientist tasked with investigating the origins, was left off the schedule. Instead, Liang Wannian, a politician in the Communist Party hierarchy, took charge of the international delegation. Liang is an epidemiologist close to top Chinese officials and China's Foreign Ministry who is widely seen as pushing the party line, not science-backed policies, according to nine people familiar with the situation who declined to be identified to speak on a sensitive subject. Liang ruled in favor of shutting the Wuhan market at the beginning of the outbreak, according to a Chinese media interview with a top China CDC official that was later deleted. Significantly, it was Liang who promoted an implausible theory that the virus came from contaminated frozen food imported into China. Liang did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Most of the WHO delegation was not allowed to go to Wuhan, which was under lockdown. The few who did learned little. They again had no access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology or the wildlife market and obtained only scant details about China CDC efforts to trace the coronavirus there. On the train, Liang lobbied the visiting WHO scientists to praise China\u2019s health response in their public report. Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saw it as the \u201cbest way to meet China\u2019s need for a strong assessment of its response.\u201d The new section was so flattering that colleagues emailed Aylward to suggest he \u201cdial it back a bit.\u201d \u201cIt is remarkable how much knowledge about a new virus has been gained in such a short time,\u201d read the final report, which was reviewed by China\u2019s top health official before it went to Tedros. As criticism of China grew, the Chinese government deflected blame. Instead of firing health officials, they declared their virus response a success and closed investigations into the officials with few job losses. \u201cThere were no real reforms, because doing reforms means admitting fault,\u201d said a public health expert in contact with Chinese health officials who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. In late February 2020, the internationally respected doctor Zhong Nanshan appeared at a news conference and said that \u201cthe epidemic first appeared in China, but it did not necessarily originate in China.\u201d Days later, Chinese leader Xi ordered new controls on virus research. A leaked directive from China\u2019s Publicity Department ordered media not to report on the virus origins without permission, and a public WeChat account reposted an essay claiming the U.S. military created COVID-19 at a Fort Detrick lab and spread it to China during a 2019 athletic competition in Wuhan. Days later, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson repeated the accusation. The false claims enraged U.S. President Donald Trump, who began publicly blaming China for the outbreak, calling COVID-19 \u201cthe China virus\u201d and the \u201ckung-flu.\u201d Chinese officials told WHO that blood tests on lab workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were negative, suggesting they hadn\u2019t been previously infected with bat coronaviruses. But when WHO pressed for an independent audit, Chinese officials balked and demanded WHO investigate the U.S. and other countries as well. By blaming the U.S., Beijing diverted blame. It was effective in China, where many Chinese were upset by racially charged criticism. But outside China, it fueled speculation of a lab leak coverup. By the time WHO led another visit to Wuhan in January 2021, a year into the pandemic, the atmosphere was toxic. Liang, the Chinese health official in charge of two earlier WHO visits, continued to promote the questionable theory that the virus was shipped into China on frozen food. He suppressed information suggesting it could have come from animals at the Wuhan market, organizing market workers to tell WHO experts no live wildlife was sold and cutting recent photos of wildlife at the market from the final report. There was heavy political scrutiny, with numerous Chinese officials who weren\u2019t scientists or health officers present at meetings. Despite a lack of direct access, the WHO team concluded that a lab leak was \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d So it came as an infuriating surprise to Chinese officials when, months later, WHO chief Tedros said that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to rule out the lab leak theory, saying such lab accidents were \u201ccommon,\u201d and pressed China to be more transparent. China told WHO any future missions to find COVID-19 origins should be elsewhere, according to a letter obtained by AP. Since then, global cooperation on the issue has ground to a halt; an independent group convened by WHO to investigate the origins of COVID-19 in 2021 has been stymied by the lack of cooperation from China and other issues. Chinese scientists are still under heavy pressure, according to 10 researchers and health\u202fofficials. Researchers who published papers on the coronavirus ran into trouble with Chinese authorities. Others were barred from travel abroad for conferences and WHO meetings. Gao, the then-director of the China CDC, was investigated after U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a review of COVID-19 data, and again after giving interviews on the virus origins. New evidence is treated with suspicion. In March 2023, scientists announced that genetic material collected from the market showed raccoon dog DNA mixed with COVID-19 in early 2020, data that WHO said should have been publicly shared years before. The findings were posted, then removed by Chinese researchers with little explanation. The head of the China CDC Institute of Viral Disease was forced to retire over the release of the market data, according to a former China CDC official who declined to be named to speak on a sensitive topic. \u201cIt has to do with the origins, so they\u2019re still worried,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIf you try and get to the bottom of it, what if it turns out to be from China?\u201d Other scientists note that any animal from which the virus may have originally jumped has long since disappeared. \u201cThere was a chance for China to cooperate with WHO and do some animal sampling studies that might have answered the question,\u201d said Tulane University\u2019s Garry. \u201cThe trail to find the source has now gone cold.\u201d ___ Cheng reported from Geneva.",

            "content": "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Monday test-fired suspected short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, the country\u2019s neighbors said, as speculation swirled that it could soon launch a banned satellite into orbit. South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the weapons launched from the North\u2019s capital region flew about 300 kilometers (185 miles) before crashing in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan . The ranges suggest the weapons could likely target sites in South Korea. The Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly condemned the launches, saying they were a \u201cclear provocation\u201d that threatens peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said it will maintain readiness to \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d respond to North Korean provocations in step with its military alliance with the United States. Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that North Korea launched at least one ballistic missile that flew 250 kilometers (155 miles) at a maximum altitude of about 50 kilometers (30 miles). He said that North Korea's repeated missiles tests and other provocative actions threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community. Japan\u2019s coast guard urged ships to use caution against falling objects, but there were no immediate reports of damage. North Korea in recent months has maintained an accelerated pace in weapons testing as it continues to expand its military capabilities while diplomacy with the United States and South Korea remained stalled. Observers say North Korea likely believes an upgraded weapons arsenal would give it leverage to win greater concessions from the U.S. if negotiations resume. North Korea said Saturday that it tested a \u201csuper-large\u201d cruise missile warhead and a new anti-aircraft missile in a western coastal area earlier last week. In early April, North Korea also test-launched what it called a solid-fuel intermediate-range missile with hypersonic warhead capabilities, a weapon that experts say is meant to attack remote targets in the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam and beyond. In past years, North Korea has test-fired nuclear-capable missiles designed to strike sites in South Korea, Japan and the mainland U.S. Many experts say North Korea already possesses nuclear missiles that can reach all of South Korea and Japan, but it has yet to develop functioning intercontinental ballistic missiles that can travel to the continental U.S. In response to North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear threats, the United States and South Korea have been strengthening their bilateral military drills and trilateral exercises with Japan. On Monday, the chairman of South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kim Myung-soo, met with U.S. Space Command Commander Stephen N. Waiting for discussions on countering North Korean threats, according to South Korea\u2019s military. Some experts say North Korea could launch its second spy satellite this month to mark a key anniversary such as the April 15 birthday of its founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of leader Kim Jong Un, or the April 25 founding anniversary of a predecessor of the North\u2019s military. U.N. Security Council resolutions ban North Korea from launching both ballistic missiles and satellites. The world body considers a satellite launch a test of its prohibited ballistic missile technology. South Korea\u2019s military said Monday that it had detected evidence that North Korea is preparing for a spy satellite launch but there are no signs that it\u2019s imminent. Last November, North Korea placed what it called its first military spy satellite into orbit, though there are widespread doubts about its capability. In late December, Kim Jong Un said North Korea would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

            "content": "QINGDAO, China -- One of China 's top military leaders took a harsh line on regional territorial disputes, telling an international naval gathering in northeastern China on Monday that the country would strike back with force if its interests came under threat. The 19th biennial meeting of the Western Pacific Naval Symposium opened in the port city of Qingdao, where China\u2019s northern naval force is based, providing a vivid backdrop to China's massive military expansion over the past two decades that has seen it build or refurbish three aircraft carriers. The four-day meeting has drawn representatives from partners and competitors including Australia, Cambodia, Chile, France, India and the U.S. and comes amid heightened tensions over China\u2019s assertive actions in the Taiwan Strait and the East and South China seas, and as China's navy has grown into the world\u2019s largest by number of hulls. Zhang Youxia, the vice chairman of the ruling Communist Party's Central Military Commission, which controls the armed forces, spoke of \u201ccommon development\u201d and said \u201cdecoupling, friction and confrontation will only divide the world into isolated islands guarding against each other with suspicion.\u201d However, he then turned to China's territorial claims, which have not been recognized under international law and in some cases have been denied. Beijing has ignored rulings not in its favor, particularly in the South China Sea, where it is in dispute with five other parties over islands, waterways and undersea resources. Japan continues to defend its control over the uninhabited Senkaku island chain, called Diaoyu by China, in the East China Sea, against incursions by the Chinese coast guard. Taiwan last week reinforced its foothold in the disputed South China Sea by establishing satellite communications between the main island and its garrison on Taiping Island, also known as Itu Aba, the largest land feature in the highly contested Spratly Island chain. China has created seven artificial islands in the area by piling sand and cement on top of coral reefs and then equipping them with airstrips and other military infrastructure. Zhang said China's territorial sovereignty \u201cbrooks no infringement and its core interests cannot be challenged. We do not provoke trouble, but we will never flinch in face of provocation. The Chinese military will resolutely defend the reunification and interest of the motherland.\" Zhang has spoken in the past of Beijing's determination to take control of the self-governing island republic of Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory, using force if necessary. With its crucial high-tech economy, Taiwan has been building up its defenses on its own and with help from the U.S., where Congress this weekend approved $8 billion in military aid for Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific. Taiwan is also building its own submarines and trainer aircraft and waiting on the delivery of upgraded versions of F-16 fighters, battle tanks and other hardware from the U.S. Zhang appeared to press China's unilateralist approach to foreign relations and military conflicts as espoused by Xi Jinping, the top military commander, Communist Party leader and head-of-state for life, who has eliminated all dissenting views. China \u201cremains committed to resolving maritime disputes with directly concerned countries through friendly consultations, but we will not allow our good faith to be abused,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cParticularly over the self-governing island republic of Taiwan that Beijing threatens to use force to bring under its control. We will take justified actions to defend our rights in accordance with the law.\u201d Zhang's comments follow a major shakeup of the Chinese military in recent months that has seen the still-unexplained disappearance of former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and several top officers in the missile corps. ___ Bodeen reported from Taipei, Taiwan.",

            "content": "GUWAHATI, India -- Voters at a handful polling places in a northeastern Indian state went back to the polls amid tight security on Monday after violence disrupted the vote last week. Indian election authorities voided the results at 11 of Manipur state's nearly 3,000 polling stations after armed men damaged election machines during the first day of voting in national elections on Friday. State officials said that at at least six of the stations, armed men broke the electronic voting machines which citizens use to cast their ballots. Manipur has been wracked by ethnic violence between the state\u2019s two dominant ethnic groups since May 2023. Around 200 people have been killed and over 60,000 displaced as mobs have rampaged through villages and torched houses. The unrest broke out when Christian Kukis protested a demand by the mostly Hindu Meiteis for a special status that would let them buy land in hills that populated by Kukis and other tribal groups. The clashes have persisted despite the army\u2019s presence in Manipur, a state of 3.7 million people tucked in the mountains on India\u2019s border with Myanmar . The world\u2019s largest democratic election began in India on Friday, as millions across 21 states cast their votes. The six-week long multi-phase election is seen as a referendum on Narendra Modi, the populist prime minister who has made Hindu nationalism mainstream as he seeks a third, straight term as the country\u2019s leader. The votes will be counted on June 4. The main opposition Congress party on Friday had alleged that the vote was being rigged in Manipur and demanded re-polling at 47 stations. Earlier that day, there were incidents of clashes among armed groups in the state. Despite the violence, the state saw 66.5% voter turnout. Other parts of the state state will also head to the polls on April 26 for a second phase of voting. ___ This article has been edited to correct the voter turnout figure for Manipur state.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 01:10:00",
            "content": "BAGHDAD -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Iraq on Monday for his first official visit in more than a decade as his country seeks greater cooperation from Baghdad in its fight against a Kurdish militant group that has a foothold in northern Iraq. Other issues also loom large between the two countries, including water supply issues and exports of oil and gas from northern Iraq to Turkey , which have been halted for more than a year. Erdogan\u2019s last visit to Iraq was in 2011, when he was Turkey\u2019s prime minister. Iraqi government spokesperson Bassem al-Awadi said in a statement that Erdogan\u2019s visit will be a \u201cmajor starting point in Iraqi-Turkish relations\u201d and will include the signing of a deal on a \u201cjoint approach to security challenges\u201d and a \u201cstrategic agreement on the water file,\u201d among other issues. Erdogan has said his country plans to launch a major operation against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist movement banned in Turkey and with operations in Iraq, during the summer, with the aim of \u201cpermanently\u201d eradicating the threat it poses. Turkey has carried out numerous ground offensives against the group in northern Iraq in the past while Turkish jets frequently target suspected PKK targets in the region. Ankara now aims to create a 30- to 40-kilometer (19 to 25-mile) deep security corridor along the joint border with Iraq, Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler told journalists last month. The group, whose fight for an autonomous Kurdish state in southeast Turkey has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1980s, is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. Baghdad has complained in the past that Turkish operations against the PKK violate its sovereignty, but appears to be coming closer to Ankara\u2019s stance. In March, after a meeting between the Iraqi and Turkish foreign ministers, Baghdad announced that the Iraqi National Security Council had issued a ban on the PKK, although it stopped short of designating it as a terrorist organization. The two countries issued a joint statement in which they said the group represents a \u201csecurity threat to both Turkey and Iraq\u201d and that its presence on Iraqi territory was a \u201cviolation of the Iraqi Constitution.\u201d Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told journalists during a visit to Washington last week that Iraq and Turkey have \u201ctrue interests with one another and common projects.\u201d He noted that the PKK has long had a presence in northern Iraq, \u201cbut we are not allowing any armed group to be on Iraqi territory and using it as a launch pad for attacks.\u201d Ankara has argued that the presence of PKK bases poses a threat to the planned construction of a major trade route, the Iraq Development Road, that would connect the port of Grand Faw in Basra, southern Iraq, to Turkey and Europe through a network of rail lines and highways. Baghdad might take a similar approach to the PKK as it has taken to Iranian Kurdish dissident groups based in northern Iraq. The presence of the Iranian dissidents had become a point of tension with Tehran, which periodically launched airstrikes on their bases in Iraq. Last summer, Iran and Iraq reached an agreement to disarm the dissident groups and relocate their members from military bases to displacement camps. Talks between Erdogan and Iraqi officials are also expected to focus on energy cooperation as well as the possible resumption of oil flow through a pipeline to Turkey. A pipeline running from the semiautonomous Kurdish region to Turkey has been shut down since March 2023, after an arbitration court ruling ordered Ankara to pay Iraq $1.5 billion for oil exports that bypassed the Iraqi central government. The sharing of oil and gas revenues has long been a contentious issue between Baghdad and Kurdish authorities in Irbil. Water rights are also likely to be a key issue on the table. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which provide most of Iraq\u2019s fresh water, originate in Turkey. In recent years, Iraqi officials have complained that dams installed by Turkey are reducing Iraq\u2019s water supply. Experts fear that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing water shortages in Iraq, with potentially devastating consequences. Mustafa Hassan, a resident of Baghdad said that he hopes that Erdogan\u2019s visit \u201cwill help to solve problems related to water, because Iraq is suffering from a water scarcity crisis, and this affects agriculture.\u201d ___ Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington, and Ali Jabar in Baghdad, contributed to this report.",

            "content": "TOKYO -- An initial analysis of flight data recorders recovered from the crash of two Japan ese navy helicopters showed no sign of mechanical problems, Japan\u2019s defense minister said Monday, indicating likely human error. One of the eight crew members died and a search is continuing for the seven others. Defense Minister Minoru Kihara said an initial analysis of data from the two flight data recorders on each helicopter showed no abnormality during their flight and that mechanical failure was most likely not the cause of the crash. The two SH-60K reconnaissance helicopters from the Maritime Self-Defense Force lost contact late Saturday during nighttime anti-submarine training near Torishima island, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) south of Tokyo, officials said. A crew member who was recovered early Sunday from the water was later pronounced dead. Searches continued Monday for the seven who were still missing, along with the fuselage of the aircraft. The seabed at the crash site east of Torishima is about 5.5 kilometers (3.4 miles) deep and the recovery is considered a challenge. Officials believe the two helicopters likely came too close and collided, Kihara said. The flight data recorders from the two aircraft were found close together, along with a blade from each helicopter, a number of helmets and fragments believed to be from both aircraft \u2014 signs the two SH-60Ks crashed almost at the same spot, officials said. The twin-engine, multi-mission helicopters developed by Sikorsky and known as Seahawks were modified and produced in Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Japan has about 70 of the modified Seahawks. The crash comes as Japan, under its 2022 security strategy, accelerates its military buildup and fortifies its defenses on southwestern Japanese islands in the Pacific and East China Sea to counter threats from China\u2019s increasingly assertive military. Japan in recent years has conducted its own extensive naval exercises as well as joint drills with the United States and other partners. Saturday\u2019s nighttime anti-submarine warfare training involved only the Japanese navy, navy chief of staff Ryo Sakai said. In 2017, a Japanese navy SH-60J, an earlier generation Seahawk, crashed during nighttime training due to human error, killing three crew. In July 2021, two SH-60s had a minor collision off the southern island of Amami Oshima, with both suffering blade damage, but causing no injuries. Following the 2021 collision, the navy introduced a set of measures aimed at ensuring enough distance between aircraft. Sakai said Saturday\u2019s crash could have been prevented if all safety measures had been adequately followed. In the U.S., the fatal crash of a MH-60S Seahawk during training off the coast of California in 2021 was attributed to mechanical failure from unsuspected damage during maintenance, according to the U.S. Navy.",

Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, the governing Morena party\u2019s candidate, remained in the front passenger seat of the vehicle listening calmly with her window down. Masked men filmed the interaction on their cell phones and one shook her hand before letting her move on. The men, who identified themselves as local residents, said they felt \u201cpowerless\u201d because the government has not done enough to provide security. They asked her to take action as president so that their township, Motozintla, along Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala, does not become a \u201cdisaster\u201d like other communities in the region. During her campaign swing through Chiapas, Sheinbaum was escorted by the army and national guard. The border area of Chiapas has been plagued by violence as the rival Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels battle for territory. Thousands of people have been displaced as the cartels work to control migrant, drug and weapons smuggling routes and forcibly recruit locals. Later Sunday, Sheinbaum confirmed the incident had occurred, but downplayed it and said she did not believe the men were part of an organized crime group. She described the encounter as \u201cvery strange\u201d because she said a media outlet critical of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration first published it. Sheinbaum has maintained a comfortable lead in the presidential race, according to polls. A federal lawmaker from L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s party who was traveling with Sheinbaum had earlier described the encounter on the social platform X.

            "date": "2024-04-22 00:16:00",
            "content": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian commander Oleksiy Tarasenko witnessed a frightening shift last month in Russia's efforts to punch through Kyiv\u2019s defense of the industrial region known as the Donbas. Standing against Russia\u2019s unyielding advance in the strategic front-line town of Chasiv Yar, he noticed that, instead of making typical light infantry assaults, Moscow\u2019s forces were taking brazen risks by launching battalion- and platoon-sized attacks, sometimes with up to 10 combat vehicles. His men destroyed up to 80 tanks in the weeks that followed, but it did not slow the enemy. The confidence of the Russian military reflected the Kremlin's knowledge that Ukraine \u2019s ammunition supplies were dwindling as the U.S. dawdled over approving more military aid. Saturday\u2019s passage by the U.S. House of Representatives of a much-awaited $61 billion package for Ukraine puts the country a step closer to an infusion of new firepower that will be rushed to the front line to fight Moscow\u2019s latest attacks. But the clock is ticking, with Russia using all its might to achieve its most significant gains since its invasion by a May 9 deadline, when Moscow commemorates World War II Victory Day. In the meantime, Kyiv has no choice but to wait for replenishment. Seeing a window of opportunity, Russia has seized the momentum on the battlefield and forced Kyiv\u2019s forces to cede tactically significant territory, one painful meter (yard) after another. Wave after wave of mechanized units came for Tarasenko's brigade. Protected under an umbrella of attack drones and artillery fire, they reached the foot of Chasiv Yar, which is the gateway to Ukraine\u2019s defensive backbone in the Donetsk region. \u201cThey concentrated disproportionately enormous resources in this direction,\u201d said Tarasenko, deputy commander of the 5th Separate Assault Brigade. \u201cThe most difficult thing is to cope with this constant onslaught from the enemy, which does not change, even though the enemy is losing a lot of military equipment and soldiers.\u201d The Pentagon has said it could get weapons moving to Ukraine within days if the Senate and President Joe Biden give final approval to the aid package. But experts and Ukrainian lawmakers said it could take weeks for the assistance to reach troops, giving Russia more time to degrade Ukrainian defenses. The seven-month effort to pass the package effectively held Ukraine hostage to the internal politics of its biggest ally. It also raised concerns about how the shifting sands of American politics will influence future military support. European partners cannot match the volume and scope of American assistance, which remains Kyiv's main hope to win the war. But that support has come with red lines, including rules that forbid using Western-supplied weapons for strikes inside the Russian Federation. Some Ukrainian officials argue that such limits handicap their ability to cripple the enemy's more robust capabilities. Assuming the assistance arrives in the next two months, plans are afoot for a potential late-summer offensive. Analysts have argued that future support should not count on one big decisive battle, but a sustained strategy over many years. But first, Ukraine must hold off Russia's attempts to break defensive lines and entrenched positions. In the past month, The Associated Press spoke to a dozen commanders across the active zones of the eastern front line, from Kupiansk in the northeast to Bakhmut farther south. They said their soldiers have rationed shells and struggled to repel enemy attacks with insufficient artillery ammunition. They are also running critically low on air-defense missiles, not only for high-end Patriot systems that protect cities, but also for tactical air systems. That has given Russian fighter-bombers an opportunity to lob thousands of deadly aerial glide bombs against Ukrainian positions, razing defenses to the ground, something Russia\u2019s air force has not been able to do before. Since January, the Kremlin has seized 360 square kilometers (140 square miles) of Ukrainian territory, roughly the size of the American city of Detroit, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. Ukrainian commanders have complained about dire ammunition shortages since late December. By February, heads of artillery units in several regions said they had less than 10% of the supplies they needed as Kyiv rushed to economize shells. Nowhere are supplies more needed than in Chasiv Yar, where after weeks of fierce fighting, Moscow is intent on conquering the town. Ukraine\u2019s commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrski, said Russia\u2019s top military leadership ordered its soldiers to capture the town by May 9, Russia\u2019s Victory Day, a holiday that marks the defeat of Nazi Germany. To reach that goal, Russia unleashes daily drone assaults and glide bombs on Ukrainian forces that have no way to counterattack. Time is of the essence, said Yurii Fedorenko, commander of the Achilles battalion of the 92nd brigade in the Chasiv Yar region. \u201cThey simply destroyed our positions with massive strikes. Now those positions are constantly hit by artillery, making it impossible to recapture them,\" he said. \u201cNow we have nothing to answer the enemy with,\u201d he added. Commanding men who have reached extreme levels of burnout, Fedorenko acknowledged the Russians were steadily advancing. At the time of the interview, Russian forces were just 500 meters (1,640 feet) from the town, he said. The soldiers who died to protect land that was lost could have been spared if the U.S. aid had been approved earlier, he said. \u201cOur losses could be reduced to a minimum, and we would not have lost territories that would later have to be reconquered.\u201d Russia picked up momentum soon after gaining control of Avdiivka in February. Immediately, Moscow\u2019s troops sought to reinforce their tactical success and push further into larger, strategically significant towns \u2014 Kostiantynivka, Sloviansk and Druzkhivka \u2014 that together form the fortress wall of Ukraine\u2019s main defense of the Donetsk region. A win in Chasiv Yar, which had a prewar population of 12,000, would bring Russia one step closer to breaking that barricade. \u201cIf the Russians manage to take Chasiv Yar, they are only about 5 to 7 kilometers away from the southernmost link in that chain,\u201d said George Barros, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. If Russia manages to push into the seam between Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka, it would be able to attack the fortress belt, he said. \u201cThen we get into the territory where the Russians might be making some really substantial operational gains and eroding Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend the rest of Donetsk,\u201d he said. An injection of new supplies would give Ukrainian forces cover and help them push the enemy back. But Russia will continue to have the upper hand in both manpower and ammunition. The Russian military has the ability to generate 20,000 to 30,000 new volunteers per month, and it holds a roughly 6-to-1 advantage in artillery. Until now, that reality has precluded any potential for a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Russian fighters \u201cdo not have the feeling that they will now lose some critical armored vehicle unit or soldier unit for which they will no longer have new reinforcements,\u201d Tarasenko said. \u201cThey don\u2019t worry about it. That is their advantage.\u201d",

            "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A woman accused of serving her ex-husband\u2019s parents and an aunt poisonous mushrooms with lunch appeared in an Australian court on Monday charged with three counts of murder and five of attempted murder. Erin Patterson, 49, appeared briefly in the Latrobe Valley Magistrates Court by video link from a Melbourne prison where she has been held since she was arrested in November last year. Magistrate Tim Walsh said he would announce on May 7 whether Patterson will face a committal hearing in the same court in Morwell or in Melbourne. Morwell is a rural town near Patterson\u2019s home about 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of Melbourne, the Victoria state capital. Committal hearings determine whether prosecutors have sufficient evidence to put charges before a jury in a Victorian Supreme Court trial. It was Patterson\u2019s second court appearance on the charges. She has yet to enter any pleas and has not applied to be released on bail. She is accused of killing her former parents-in-law, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, and Gail Patterson\u2019s sister, Heather Wilkinson, 66. All three died in a hospital days after consuming a meal at Patterson\u2019s home in July last year. She is also accused of the attempted murder of her ex-husband, Simon Patterson, at that lunch and on three previous occasions dating back to 2021. Simon Patterson did not accept an invitation to attend the lunch. She also is charged with the attempted murder of Wilkinson\u2019s husband, Ian Wilkinson, 68. Ian Wilkinson spent seven weeks in a hospital following the lunch. Police say the symptoms of the four sickened family members were consistent with poisoning from wild Amanita phalloides, known as death cap mushrooms. The potential maximum sentence in Victoria for murder is life imprisonment, and for attempted murder is 25 years in prison. Patterson appeared in court on Monday wearing a blue prison sweater. Walsh asked if Patterson could hear at the outset of the hearing, and she replied, \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Her lawyer, Colin Mandy, said his client wanted the committal hearing held in Morwell, even if that meant a delay until next year. \u201cIf it happens next year, then Ms. Patterson\u2019s content to wait for that,\u201d Mandy told the magistrate. Mandy said she wanted the hearing to take place close to her home. Defense lawyers have provided prosecutors with a list of anticipated witnesses to be called at the committal. Mandy said he expected the hearing would last three weeks.",

            "content": "MALE, Maldives -- Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu's political party has swept parliamentary election s in a strong endorsement of his pro-China foreign policy, according to preliminary results reported Monday by local media. The People's National Congress won 70 out of 93 seats in Sunday's vote, and along with three seats secured by its allies has taken absolute control of Parliament, according to the preliminary results. The Maldivian Democratic Party, led by former President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who is seen as pro-India, held 65 seats in the previous Parliament but won only 15 seats, the news site Mihaaru.com reported. Official results are expected later Monday. The election was closely watched by regional powers India and China , which are competing for influence in the archipelago nation, which has a strategic location in the Indian Ocean. Muizzu\u2019s election as president last year sharpened the rivalry between India and China as he took a pro-China stand and acted to remove Indian troops stationed on one of Maldives' islets. Sunday's election was easier than expected for Muizzu, who had been expected to face a tough fight because some of his allies had fallen out and more parties entered the race. Six political parties and independent groups fielded 368 candidates for the 93 seats in Parliament. The number of seats is six more than in the previous Parliament following adjustments for population growth. Muizzu ran for president on a campaign theme of \u201cIndia out,\u201d accusing his predecessor of compromising national sovereignty by giving India too much influence. At least 75 Indian military personnel were stationed in the Maldives and their known activities were operating two aircraft donated by India and assisting in the rescue of people stranded or faced with calamities at sea. Muizzu has taken steps to have civilians take over those activities. Relations were strained further when Indian social media activists started a boycott of tourism in Maldives. That was in retaliation for three Maldivian deputy ministers making derogatory statements about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for raising the idea of promoting tourism in Lakshadweep, India\u2019s own string of islands similar to the Maldives. India has fallen from being the top source of foreign visitors to Maldives to No. 6, according to Maldives government statistics. Muizzu visited China earlier this year and negotiated an increase in the number of tourists and inbound flights from China. In 2013, Maldives joined China\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative meant to build ports and highways to expand trade \u2014 and China\u2019s influence \u2014 across Asia, Africa and Europe.",

            "date": "2024-04-21 22:04:00",
            "content": "NAPLES, Italy -- Europe is the fastest-warming continent and its temperatures are rising at roughly twice the global average, two top climate monitoring organizations reported Monday, warning of the consequences for human health, glacier melt and economic activity. The U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization and the European Union's climate agency, Copernicus, said in a joint report that the continent has the opportunity to develop targeted strategies to speed up the transition to renewable resources like wind, solar and hydroelectric power in response to the effects of climate change. The continent generated 43% of its electricity from renewable resources last year, up from 36% the year before, the agencies say in their European State of the Climate report for last year. More energy in Europe was generated from renewables than from fossil fuels for the second year running. The latest five-year averages show that temperatures in Europe are now running 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, compared to 1.3 degrees Celsius higher globally, the report says \u2014 just shy of the targets under the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. \u201cEurope saw yet another year of increasing temperatures and intensifying climate extremes \u2014 including heat stress with record temperatures, wildfires, heat waves, glacier ice loss and lack of snowfall,\u201d said Elisabeth Hamdouch, the deputy head of unit for Copernicus at the EU\u2019s executive commission. The report serves up a continental complement for WMO's flagship state of the global climate report, which has been published annually for three decades, and this year came with a \u201cred alert\u201d warning that the world isn't doing enough to fight the consequences of global warming. Copernicus has reported that March marked the 10th straight month of record monthly temperatures. The average sea-surface temperature for the ocean across Europe hit its highest annual level in 2023, the Europe report said. The European report focuses this year on the impact of high temperatures on human health, noting that deaths related to heat have risen across the continent. It said more than 150 lives were lost directly last year in connection with storms, floods and wildfires. The cost of weather- and climate-related economic losses in 2023 were estimated at more than 13.4 billion euros (about $14.3 billion). \u201cHundreds of thousands of people were affected by extreme climate events in 2023, which have been responsible for large losses at continental level, estimated to be at least in the tens of billions of euros,\u201d said Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo. Extreme weather fanned heat waves, wildfires, droughts and flooding, the report said. High temperatures have contributed to a loss of glacier ice on the continent, including in the Alps \u2014 which have lost about 10% of their remaining glacier ice over the last two years. Still, the report\u2019s authors pointed to some exceptions, such as how temperatures were below average in Scandinavia and Iceland even if the mercury was higher than average across much of the continent as a whole.",

Thousands of die-hard supporters of Bolsonaro attended. Musk, a self-declared free speech absolutist, is a target in an ongoing investigation over the dissemination of fake news by supporters of Bolsonaro. Musk said the social platform X wouldn't comply with a high court justice's order to remove certain accounts accused of spreading disinformation. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who took over Twitter \u2014 now X \u2014 in late 2022, accused Justice Alexandre de Moraes of suppressing free speech and violating Brazil\u2019s constitution. He noted on X that users could seek to bypass any shutdown of the social media platform by using VPNs, or virtual private networks. That prompted de Moraes to include Musk in an ongoing investigation into so-called digital militias and open a new investigation into obstruction, incitement and criminal conspiracy. Several speakers lauded Musk at Sunday's rally. \"What you see here are people who love liberty, who will not give up and will not kneel down to dictators, people who are willing to give their lives for freedom,\u201d said Gustavo Gayer, a pro-Bolsonaro congressman. For his part, the former president lauded Musk for demonstrating \u201ccourage\u201d in the face of what he called censorship by de Moraes. \u201cHe is the man who really preserves true freedom for all of us,\u201d said Bolsonaro, who is himself under investigation for a plethora of crimes ranging from aiding an effort to overturn the 2022 election results and plotting a coup against his leftist successor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Brazil is an important market for social media companies. About 40 million Brazilians, or about 18% of the population, access X at least once per month, according to the market research group Emarketer.",

            "content": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip -- Sabreen Jouda came into the world seconds after her mother left it. Their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike shortly before midnight Saturday. Until that moment, the family was like so many other Palestinians trying to shelter from the war in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. Sabreen's father was killed. Her 4-year-old sister was killed. Her mother was killed. But emergency responders learned that her mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, was 30 weeks pregnant. In a rush at the Kuwaiti hospital where the bodies were taken, medical workers performed an emergency cesarean section. Little Sabreen was near death herself, fighting to breathe. Her tiny body lay in the recovery position on a small piece of carpet as medical workers gently pumped air into her open mouth. A gloved hand tapped at her chest. She survived. On Sunday, in the hours after the airstrike, she whimpered and wriggled inside an incubator at the nearby Emirati hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. She wore a diaper too big for her and her identity was scrawled in pen on a piece of tape around her chest: \u201cThe martyr Sabreen al-Sakani\u2019s baby.\" \u201cWe can say there is some progress in her health condition, but the situation is still at risk,\u201d said Dr. Mohammad Salameh, head of the unit. \u201cThis child should have been in the mother\u2019s womb at this time, but she was deprived of this right.\u201d He described her as a premature orphan girl. But she is not alone. \u201cWelcome to her. She is the daughter of my dear son. I will take care of her. She is my love, my soul. She is a memory of her father. I will take care of her,\u201d said Ahalam al-Kurdi, her paternal grandmother. She clutched her chest and rocked with grief. At least two-thirds of the more than 34,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza since this war began have been children and women, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The other Israeli airstrike in Rafah overnight killed 17 children and two women from an extended family. Not everyone is immediately recovered after such attacks. \u201cMy son was also with them. My son became body parts and they have not found him yet. They do not recognize him,\u201d said Mirvat al-Sakani, Sabreen's maternal grandmother. \u201cThey have nothing to do with anything. Why are they targeting them? We don\u2019t know why, how? We do not know.\u201d On Sunday, the survivors buried the dead. Children in bloodied wraps were placed in body bags and into the dusty ground as families wailed. Little boys watched and tried to keep their footing at the edge of a grave. ___ Find more of AP\u2019s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

Amid calls for his resignation, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley is also expected to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Home Secretary James Cleverly, who together are responsible for law and order in the city. \u201cWe remain focused on doing everything possible to ensure Jewish Londoners feel safe in this city,\u201d the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement Sunday. \u201cWe know recent events and some of our recent actions have contributed to concerns felt by many.\u201d The meeting comes as London police struggle to manage tensions sparked by the Israel-Hamas war, with some Jewish residents saying they feel threatened by repeated pro-Palestinian marches through the streets of the U.K. capital. The marches have been largely peaceful. However, many demonstrators accuse Israel of genocide and a small number have shown support for Hamas, the group that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and which has been banned by the U.K. government as a terrorist organization. The Metropolitan Police force has deployed thousands of officers during each of the dozen major marches as it seeks to protect the rights of the pro-Palestinian protesters and prevent clashes with counterdemonstrators and Jewish residents. In addition to meeting with leaders of the Jewish community, senior police officers wrote to the man at the center of the latest controversy, offering to meet with him to apologize and discuss what more could be done to \u201censure Jewish Londoners feel safe.\u2033 Gideon Falter, chief executive of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, was wearing a traditional Jewish skullcap when he was stopped by police while trying to cross a street in central London as demonstrators filed past on April 13. One officer told Falter he was worried that the man\u2019s \u201cquite openly Jewish\u201d appearance could provoke a reaction from the protesters, according to video posted on social media by the campaign group. A second officer then told Falter he would be arrested if he refused to be escorted out of the area, because he would be \u201ccausing a breach of the peace.\u201d Metropolitan Police initially apologized for the language the officer used in describing Falter\u2019s appearance, but said counterdemonstrators had to be aware \u201cthat their presence is provocative.\u201d The department later deleted that apology from its social media accounts and issued a second statement. \u201cIn an effort to make a point about the policing of protest we caused further offense,\u201d the force said on Friday. \u201cThis was never our intention. ... Being Jewish is not a provocation. Jewish Londoners must be able to feel safe in the city.\u201d",

            "content": "The $95 billion foreign aid package that passed the House on Saturday included legislation to force a sale of TikTok by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. If the measure becomes law and if that sale then doesn't occur within a year, the app would be banned in the U.S. amid widespread data-sharing and foreign influence fears -- which TikTok says are baseless . So, what's next for the push to divest or ban the hugely popular social media platform in the U.S.? The future in the Senate and beyond The Senate plans to take up the foreign aid package next week, starting Tuesday, putting it on track for final passage by midweek. The campaign to force TikTok to be divested or be banned has earned broad bipartisan support, with lawmakers echoing worries that TikTok could harvest Americans' user data for Beijing -- or be used as a vehicle to spread Chinese propaganda. House Speaker Mike Johnson hailed an earlier version of the sell-or-ban bill that passed the House in March , saying it \"demonstrates Congress' opposition to Communist China's attempts to spy on and manipulate Americans, and signals our resolve to deter our enemies.\" Some supporters of divestment also note that China already restricts hugely popular American platforms like YouTube in their country. TikTok has defended its data management at length , saying U.S. user traffic flows through a third party within the U.S., along with additional oversight protections. The TikTok logo is displayed outside TikTok social media app company offices in Culver City, Calif., on March 16, 2023. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images, FILE ByteDance is \"not owned or controlled by any government or state entity,\" TikTok says, though skeptics believe ByteDance could hypothetically be forced under Chinese law to comply with the government there. While there are some critics on Capitol Hill of the push against TikTok, the divestment-or-ban legislation continues to gain steam, and the White House said President Joe Biden would sign the earlier version of the bill. High-profile Democrats like Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell of Washington have now signaled support for the TikTok provision, too. Cantwell was an obstacle to the House's previous bill to force a sale or ban of TikTok, which passed in March and then stalled in the Senate. But she's since come around, saying last week that House Republicans earned her support by amending their legislation to extend the deadline for when ByteDance would be required to sell the app from six months to a year after the law were to go into effect. The TikTok measure could still be stripped out of the foreign aid legislation in the Senate, but that would require the entire package to be sent back to the House for another vote -- at the same time that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have stressed urgency for acting on the additional money for Ukraine and Israel.

The company has mounted aggressive efforts to sway lawmakers to their position, but it's unclear what their strategy is now. In a statement, TikTok slammed the renewed efforts behind divestment. \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" the platform said. TikTok would likely sue to block the divestment legislation from going into effect at the end of the one-year sale window. Rep.

In March, China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao indicated officials would seek to block any transfer of the app's technology, saying the country would \"firmly oppose\" a forced sale. Of perhaps the greatest concern is the app's algorithm, seen as essential to its popularity in surfacing viral video content. Users are already familiar with the algorithm's success, even if they don't realize that's what allows the app to feed users a never-ending stream of videos related to their interests. Selling TikTok without that technology would be like selling a car without an engine. What are TikTokers saying? Many TikTokers say they oppose the legislation, which could upend their digital media careers and businesses, and they are making their voices heard. A group of about 50 held a demonstration in front of the Capitol while the House voted on the package on Saturday. A group of 30-plus creators also recently signed an open letter to President Joe Biden warning him that taking action against the app would be a \"serious error\" that could be \"alienating young voters\" in this election year. Another group of TikTok creators are planning to rally outside the Capitol on Tuesday.",

            "content": "Speaker Mike Johnson earned praise from both a top Republican and a progressive Democrat on Sunday for allowing votes on a $95 billion foreign aid package , suggesting he'll be able to hold onto his job if conservative hard-liners make good on their threat to force a vote to remove him as the leader of the House. \"I am so proud of the speaker, Mike Johnson. He went through a transformation,\" House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said on ABC News' \"This Week.\" \"At the end of the day, a profile in courage is putting the nation above yourself -- and that's what he did. He said, 'At the end of the day, I'm going to be on the right side of history, irrespective of my job,' and I think that was what I admired so much.\" Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, agreed. \"I disagree with Speaker Johnson on many issues, and I've been very critical of him,\" Khanna told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl in a separate interview. \"But he did the right thing here and he deserves to keep his job 'til the end of his term.\" Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Johnson's loudest critics within their party, has proposed but not yet acted on a motion to vacate the speakership over his support for the foreign aid bills -- in particular $60.8 billion to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. More Republicans, including House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, voted against the Ukraine aid bill than for it over the weekend. Greene would need only one other Republican to join her in ousting Johnson, as happened last year to Kevin McCarthy, unless enough Democrats side with him. According to Khanna on Sunday, they will -- even absent additional concessions. \"Would you and fellow Democrats that will protect him at this moment -- ask for anything in return?\" Karl pressed. \"I'll leave the negotiations to ... [Minority Leader Hakeem] Jeffries, but I don't think everything in politics needs to be transactional,\" Khanna said. \"I think here you have Speaker Johnson, who not only put this up for a vote but he also separated the bills, which I thought was courageous. He let people vote their conscience on Taiwan, on the offensive aid to Israel, on Ukraine. And I give him credit for that.\" The House votes on Saturday -- advancing the four foreign aid bills for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific allies -- marked a dramatic reversal for Republican leaders like Johnson, who for months have said additional funds to Ukraine must be tied to a tightening of U.S. border and immigration laws. But efforts to broker compromise on that point failed to win over enough conservatives. A high-profile agreement in the Senate to overhaul border policy was quickly rejected by Johnson and others as insufficient after opposition from former President Donald Trump. And then, earlier this month, Johnson announced his support for individual votes on additional aid, including to Ukraine as well as to Israel, currently at war with Hamas. \"To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\" Johnson said last week, invoking his own son, who is going to the Naval Academy. On \"This Week,\" McCaul was pressed by Karl over Johnson's changing views -- and the lengthy delay involved in the legislative process, to ultimately end up with Congress backing a similar amount of aid as the White House first proposed last year. McCaul said that Johnson initially supported the position of hard-line Republicans but recognized that with the government divided, another path had to be chosen. \"He tried to do what the, you know, say the Freedom Caucus wanted him to do. It wasn't going to work in the Senate or the White House,\" McCaul said. \"At the end of the day, we were running out of time. Ukraine's getting ready to fall.\" Johnson's classified briefings and hearing from Republican leaders on the issue like House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner had influenced his thinking, McCaul said. He signaled that, essentially, Johnson, once a little-known legislator, had to learn on the job after being thrust into the speakership in the fall amid a chaotic power struggle within the GOP's House conference.

Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on April 16, 2024. Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/Reuters \"The stock in Mike Johnson's gone way up. I think the respect for him's gone way up because he did the right thing irrespective of his job. That garnered a lot of respect,\" McCaul continued. \"And also from the Democrat side.\" Beyond just the foreign aid bills that were approved on Saturday, Johnson has had to repeatedly use the votes of the Democratic minority in order to move forward on some key legislation, like government funding. That's because Republicans hold only a very narrow majority of a few votes but have been unable to reach consensus among themselves on various bills. Asked on \"This Week\" if such a dynamic indicates the House is actually now in some kind of \"coalition government,\" McCaul replied, \"I don't know, maybe some people like that.\" He then dinged lawmakers like Greene for her ultimatum against Johnson. \"When the motion gets threatened every week in the Congress, that is being abused,\" McCaul said. \"And I think we need to fix that. That is a tool that's being abused by a minority when the majority of my conference don't agree with them.\" He said that on the issue of Ukraine aid, Republican colleagues like Greene, who decry more aid as a waste over major domestic problems, \"bought into this notion that it's an either/or proposition. ... You can't support Ukraine without the border. We can do both. We're a great nation. Now we are stuck in a political issue here.\" \"The eyes of the world are watching and our adversaries are watching and history is watching,\" he went on to say. \"And that's what I kept telling my colleagues.\" Rep. Khanna, in his separate interview, expanded on his views on another big part of the aid votes this weekend: more money for Israel as it fights Hamas in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack sparked a war. Khanna was one of 37 Democrats who voted against the individual aid bill for Israel, but he sought to draw a contrast between his opposition for offensive funds versus defensive funds to allow Israel to protect itself. \"It was a hard vote. I mean, look, it -- this was a stance against a blank check for [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and offensive weapons unconditionally while he's talking about going into Rafah ... when we know more women and children are going to die,\" Khanna said, echoing the increasing criticism that Israel's bombardment of Gaza cities has killed far too many civilians. (Israel insists it takes steps to protect civilians.) \"We wanted to make it clear that there has to be a change in strategy and no more famine and suffering in Gaza,\" Khanna said, continuing: \"So why are we giving this unconditionally to Netanyahu when the entire world is saying that there's famine there, that we need a new strategy, that we need release of the hostages [thought to be held by Hamas] and peace?\" Pressed by Karl on his vote against funding for Israel in the wake of Iran's direct strikes on the country this month -- marking a new phase in what has long been seen as a shadow war between them -- Khanna said he would have supported strictly defense-related monies. The goal, however, should be an end to the fighting through coalition building in the region, he said. \"The reality is, until we have a security cooperation effort, a diplomatic architecture in the Middle East, with Iran, with Saudi Arabia, with Israel, you're never going to get peace,\" he said. Khanna also took a skeptical view of the legislative push to force TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell it or face a ban in the U.S. amid data security and foreign influence concerns, which TikTok calls baseless. \"I don't think it's going to pass First Amendment scrutiny because I think there are less restrictive alternatives. ... I doubt it survives scrutiny in the Supreme Court,\" Khanna predicted.",

            "date": "2024-04-21 12:20:00",
            "content": "Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer is pushing back on claims that the institution has become increasingly political , reflecting the partisan divides in America at large as the high court weighs in on Donald Trump's candidacy , abortion access and more. \"I've not seen politics in the court, and I've been a judge for 40 years,\" Breyer told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl in an interview that aired Sunday. \"Not politics in the sense in which I understood that word when I worked for Sen. [Ted] Kennedy. ... No, that isn't there. That just isn't there.\" Breyer, who retired in 2022, is the author of the new book \"Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism, Not Textualism.\" Over his nearly three decades on the high court, Breyer saw its ideological balance shift more to the right and the justices now split 6-3 between conservatives and liberals. But the judges' decisions don't match the ideological divides seen in the White House and in Congress, Breyer said. Rather, the justices are driven by their interpretations of the law and Constitution, their relationships with each other -- and, to some extent, an awareness of how they are seen by the public. Appearing on \"This Week,\" he addressed some of the broad dynamics at the court but avoided commenting directly on its decisions, including overruling Roe v. Wade's guarantees to national abortion access in 2022 or, earlier this year, unanimously ruling that former President Trump can remain on the 2024 ballot following challenges to his candidacy under the Constitution's \"insurrection clause.\" That case thrust the Supreme Court into the middle of a presidential election in a way that it hadn't been for nearly a quarter of a century, since the landmark Bush v. Gore ruling settled the 2000 presidential election. Breyer wrote in his dissent at the time that he didn't believe the court should have taken up the matter. He said on \"This Week\" that dissents have real value -- but that unanimous rulings, as happened in the Trump ballot challenge, carry weight, too. Justice Stephen Breyer appears on ABC News This Week. ABC News \"I always thought, well, it doesn't hurt to publish these things [dissents]. It puts out another point of view. It shows people, which they would believe anyway, that not everybody's in agreement,\" he said. \"But there's also something to be said to try to keep down the extent to which you publicly reveal the disagreement.\" The Supreme Court this week will take up another Trump case with potentially vast legal and political ramifications: whether presidents have immunity from prosecution for conducting their official duties -- and whether Trump's challenges to his 2020 election loss fell within his official duties. If the justices side with Trump, that could upend two of the four criminal cases against him, though prosecutors maintain that his alleged criminal acts should fall outside of any immunity. He denies all wrongdoing. On \"This Week,\" Breyer was firm in his view when Karl questioned whether or not the court wanted to add to the political divide within the country: \"No, God of course not. But you're looking for an easy answer when -- I'm not being coy, [but I'm] saying, 'No, there aren't easy answers.'\" Related Stories 'This Week' Transcript 4-21-24: Michael McCaul Apr 21, 9:50 AM Supreme Court will take up the legal fight over ghost guns, firearms without serial numbers 1 hour ago Guest lineups for the Sunday news shows Apr 19, 6:58 PM Pressed by Karl about whether the justices privately weigh strategically ruling as a bloc on some cases, like on Trump's ballot access or the immunity question, in order to present a bipartisan consensus to the public, Breyer demurred. He said that there are certainly delicate deliberations among the justices: \"It may be that you can find a compromise in the conference or a way of approaching things in the conference that will, in fact, solve a number of problems. And that could be one of the problems.\" But he insisted there wasn't the kind of horse-trading Karl referenced. \"[Former Justice] Sandra O'Connor used to say this: The first unwritten rule is nobody speaks twice 'til everyone speaks once. Second unwritten rule: Tomorrow is another day. You and I were the greatest of allies on case one. Case two, we're absolutely at loggerheads,\" he said. Justice Stephen Breyer appears on ABC News This Week. ABC News Breyer also challenged the idea, increasingly prevalent among the conservative-leaning justices, that the courts should only focus on the text of statutes and the Constitution to determine the outcomes of cases, a legal theory known as textualism. As he highlights in his book, Breyer believes that judges must consider other factors when interpreting laws, too, including who wrote them, why they were written, how they reflect the values of the Constitution and the practical consequences of court decisions. \"Who wrote those words and what did they have in mind? What was Congress trying to do? What are the consequences if you go one way rather than another way? How does it fit into a set of values that begins with the Constitution?\" Breyer said. \"Judges have always done that kind of thing.\" That ideology is directly at odds with the textualist approach highlighted in the 2022 overruling of Roe in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case. In the majority ruling, Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote that, \"We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today's decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision.\" Despite acknowledging that the court's decisions will directly impact society at large, Breyer said that factor doesn't lead the decision-making process for justices. \"I would say that's in your mind,\" he said. \"When you say -- does that lead to your deciding X rather than not X? Well, I can never say never, but rarely.\" He quoted the late constitutional law professor Paul Freund. \"No judge should or will be moved by the temperature of the day, but every judge will be aware of the climate of the season.\"",

This copy may not be in its final form, may be updated and may contain minor transcription errors. For previous show transcripts, visit the \"This Week\" transcript archive . JONATHAN KARL, ABC \"THIS WEEK\" CO-ANCHOR: I'm joined now by the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Michael McCaul. So, let me ask you, Congressman, at the end, the vote was overwhelming, particularly on Ukraine. REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIR & (R) TEXAS: Right. KARL: On all of these bills. Why did it have to be so difficult? Why would \u2013 why did it take months to happen? MCCAUL: Well, I think, you know, the motion to vacate McCarthy, which is a rarely used tool \u2013 only twice in the history of Congress, right, and the threat of the motion to vacate kept this from coming to the floor in a timely basis. I have to say, watching your piece, I am so proud of the speaker, Mike Johnson. He went through a transformation. At the end of the day, a profile in courage is putting the nation above yourself. And that's when he did. He said at the end of the day I'm going to \u2013 I'm going to be on the right side of history irrespective of my job. And I think that was what I admired so much. KARL: It was a transformation. I mean he \u2013 he had initially said, no Ukraine funding until we take care of the border. He was with a lot of \u2013 you know, what \u2013 basically what the radicals are saying. What \u2013 how do you explain that transformation? What made Johnson become the steadfast guy on this? The \u2013 as you said, the profile in courage? MCCAUL: I think he tried to do what the, you know, say the Freedom Caucus wanted him to do. It wasn't going to work in the Senate or the White House. At the end of the day, we were running out of time. Ukraine's getting ready to fall. And I think the \u2013 I think the briefings that he got in the classified space, the advice he got from people like me and Mike Turner, House Intelligence, Armed Services, I think talking to world leaders, he became the man that went from a district in Louisiana to the speaker of the United States, to also someone who had to look at the entire world and had to carry the burden of that and make the right decision. And his son's going to Annapolis. He is smart. He knows what's at stake here if we surrender in Ukraine, like we did in Afghanistan. America will be weaker, not stronger. KARL: It's fascinating, he really was the one guy that could either make it happen or not happen. Is his job now in jeopardy? MCCAUL: I tell you what, he's got my support. And he has a lot of \u2013 I think he \u2013 his \u2013 the stock in Mike Johnson\u2019s gone way up. I think the respect for him\u2019s gone way up because he did the right thing irrespective of his job. That garnered a lot of respect. And also from the Democrat side. Now, that\u2019s not what you normally want. But I do think that \u2013 KARL: What's not what you normally want? MCCAUL: Well \u2013 KARL: To rely on Democrats? MCCAUL: To have to do that, right? KARL: Yes. MCCAUL: It shows you that we're in a bipartisan era to some strange \u2013 in some strange way where Democrats will be able to back the speaker on the other side of the aisle and not have him vacated out of the chair. But I think that \u2013 I think \u2013 I think he's in good shape. I really do. KARL: I mean, you already have enough Republicans to force it -- it only takes one to force the vote and you already have enough to remove him if it were only Republicans. So it looks like he's going to need to rely on Democrats to remain speaker of the House. How does that change the dynamic? I mean -- MCCAUL: Well, I think there are also -- KARL: We now have a coalition government in the -- in the House effectively? MCCAUL: Well, I don\u2019t know, maybe some people like that. I mean, there are -- KARL: Yeah. MCCAUL: I mean, there are -- there are those in my party -- look, the motion to vacate has only been used in history. Once Joe Cannon used it against himself to keep his position, and then McCarthy. When the motion gets threatened every week in the Congress, that is being abused. And I think we need to fix that. That is a tool that's being abused by a minority when the majority of my conference don't agree with them. And they use that because they think that gives them power, and it does if they have a gun to the speaker's head every day. And so, I think that's something that we\u2019ll -- we'll be looking at. KARL: I mean, when you look -- when you heard the way Johnson was talking about this moment in history, whether or not we support Ukraine, the warning that if we don't, if Putin succeeds there, he moves through Europe, potentially. It\u2019s certainly what -- particularly the Eastern Europeans worry about. You've made that case. Why is it that a majority of Republicans in the House voted against supporting Ukraine? MCCAUL: I think they bought into this notion that it's an either/or proposition. You can't secure the border -- you can't support Ukraine without the border. We can do both. We're a great nation. Now we are stuck in a political issue here. But, you know, America's back, and we have our allies back now. And the people, you know, in Israel, and in Ukraine, and in Taiwan, and our NATO allies now know that America's back. That we're leading the free world like Ronald Reagan did -- and, you know, Reagan brought down the Soviet Union for God's sakes. The eyes of the world are watching and our adversaries are watching, and history is watching. And that's what I kept telling my colleagues, do you want to be a Chamberlain or a Churchill? Because that is the moment in time that we are at. KARL: Well, one of your colleagues who agrees with you on this, Dan Crenshaw, said that looking at his colleagues that don't support this, fellow Republicans, it's -- I\u2019m guessing the reasoning is they want Russia to win so badly they're willing to oust the speaker over it. I mean, how is it that we have Republic -- the party of Reagan, or formerly the party of Reagan, acting as if they want Russia to succeed in Ukraine? MCCAUL: I grew up in the Cold War, and I see -- I see the whole thing differently. I think if we -- if we -- if we surrender on Ukraine like we did in Afghanistan, which was a debacle, is the United States of America going to be stronger or weaker? I would say weaker, and then Putin will invade Moldova. That\u2019s not Article 5. Georgia, he'll threaten the Baltics. And the United States has already -- we can't shrink from this responsibility. You know, I quoted Chamber -- Churchill yesterday, the gathering storm. He talked about how it was unnecessary war. He saw the axis of evil and Hitler coming to power, but then he says, also, this is an unnecessary war that could have been stopped. My dad was in that war. Just think if we could have stopped Hitler at Poland, how much blood and treasure we could have prevented. I think we're at the same moment in history now. KARL: So where's Trump on this? I mean, we saw it when we met with Viktor Orban in Turkey, Orban came out and said, not a penny more for Ukraine. Where's -- where\u2019s the leader (ph) of your party on this? MCCAUL: If you read through the tea leaves, he has not come out and condemned a vote for Ukraine. What he said -- KARL: Not yet, yeah. MCCAUL: -- what he said, it wouldn\u2019t happen if I\u2019d been president. He likes the idea of the loan program. You're going to hear Lindsey Graham talk today on Sunday. We\u2019ve been talking to him about this loan program, and Mike Johnson has, too. He likes the idea that it's not just a giveaway, but a loan program like the EU has for Ukraine. And so, I think what he wants is for a lifeline to be given to Ukraine so that when he gets into office, in his thinking, that he can then negotiate and save it. KARL: Well, it's a loan program that can be forgiven. Congressman McCaul, Chairman McCaul, thank you very much for joining us. MCCAUL: Thanks, Jon. Thanks for having me. KARL: Appreciate it. KARL: After a busy and dramatic day on Capitol Hill, I'm joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of California. Congressman Khanna, does Speaker Johnson deserve credit for how this played out? REP. RO KHANNA, (D) ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE & (D) CALIFORNIA: He does. Look, we came into Congress together and he always cared about civility. He actually led the civility pledge. KARL: That's right. Yes. KHANNA: And he \u2013 we had one issue, which was give individual votes. Don't lump things together. And I give him credit for doing this. I would actually vote to table any motion to vacate him. You know, Congressman McCaul quoted Churchill. One of the things Churchill said is that America always exhausted every wrong option until doing the right thing. KARL: Yes. KHANNA: And this shows that American democracy still is very strong.

In other words, you will protect Speaker Johnson's job if Marjorie Taylor Greene and the others go through with their threat to try to remove him? KHANNA: I would, though the end of the term. I expect Speaker Pelosi -- Speaker Jeffries will be there in 2025. KARL: Right \u2013 not \u2013 speaker, yes. Yes. KHANNA: But look, I'm a progressive Democrat and I think you would have a few progressive Democrats doing that. And I disagree with Speaker Johnson on many issues and have been very critical of him. But he did the right thing here and he deserves to keep his job until the end of his term. KARL: Now, would you and fellow Democrats that will protect him at this moment ask him anything in return? I mean do we effectively have \u2013 you heard me ask Congressman McCaul, a coalition government in the House? KHANNA: I'll leave the negotiations to Speaker Jeffries. KARL: Yes. KHANNA: But I don't think everything in politics needs to be transactional. I think here you have Speaker Johnson, who not only put this up for a vote, but he also separated the bills, which I thought was courageous. He let people vote their conscience on Taiwan, on the offensive aid to Israel, on \u2013 on Ukraine. And I give him credit for that. KARL: Now, you were one of the 37 who voted against the funding for Israel. Tell me \u2013 tell me more. Tell me why. I mean I \u2013 you know, why? And was that a high number or a low number in your \u2013 in your view? KHANNA: It was a high number. It was a hard vote. I mean, look, it \u2013 this was a stance against a blank check for Netanyahu and offensive weapons unconditionally while he's talking about going into Rafah with \u2013 when we know more women and children are going to die. And the reason that you had people like Jamie Raskin, Lloyd Doggett, myself, who have voted for Israel aid year after year and voted for Iron Dome, take this stand, is that we wanted to make it clear that there has to be a change in strategy and no more famine and suffering in Gaza. KARL: I'm sure you saw the report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" on Friday that the administration \u2013 the Biden administration is considering a billion-dollar arms deal with Israel. Are you concerned about how Biden is handling this? KHANNA: I am in terms of, I\u2019m glad that he's moving in the rhetoric. But we can't be shipping offensive weapon when Netanyahu, on his own terms, is defying the president's State Department, defying the president's secretary of defense. And we know that thousands of people are going to die. And, by the way, Jon, we know that Israel is still using the 2022 authorization and appropriation for Iron Dome, which I voted for, and many of the 37 who voted no voted for that funding. The money yesterday is not going to be used for another two and a half years. So why are we giving this unconditionally to Netanyahu when the entire world is saying that there's famine there, that we need a new strategy, that we need release of the hostages and peace? KARL: So have you -- have you given this message to the White House? KHANNA: They know. (LAUGHTER) KHANNA: They -- they've heard from many -- many of us. But it's not just progressive Democrats. I mean -- and we need an architecture for peace in -- in the Middle East. I mean, look, Iran's attacks were totally unjustified. We -- I voted to condemn them. But the reality is, until we have a security cooperation effort, a diplomatic architecture in the Middle East, with Iran, with Saudi Arabia, with Israel, you're never going to get peace. And we're not going to be able to do what Lindsey Graham wants, which is blow Iran off the map. So what is the alternative? How are we going to get diplomacy and peace? That's where President Biden should be leading, as President Obama did. KARL: I mean, given the Iran attack, attempted attack on Israel, I mean, it was for the most part unsuccessful. But, I mean, how do you -- how do you not support Israel in terms of defense aid at a time when the Iranians, you know, have done something they have never done before, which is try to directly attack the -- the Israelis... KHANNA: You know, I... KARL: ... directly from Iran to Israel? KHANNA: You absolutely do, and I supported Iron Dome funding. I would have voted for a -- we tried -- Dan Kildee introduced an amendment saying let's just make this about Iron Dome and David's Sling and Arrow 3. That amendment wasn't ruled in order. Many of us have voted for all the defensive aid. I'd still support it, and I'd support the United States using the Interceptors to knock anything down against Iran. But what we need is to figure out how we de-escalate, not give them offensive weapons now going to Hezbollah to expand the war. And by the way, Jon, look, I'm for the Labor tradition, from Ben-Gurion to Golda Meir to Rabin to Peres to Barak. I'm not for Begin to Sharon to Netanyahu. And what you've done is given a far-right Israeli government a carte blanche right now. KARL: And before you go, there was also the vote on TikTok that was part of this. I know you have opposed efforts to force the sale of TikTok with the threat of a ban. But now it looks like, if TikTok is not sold within a year, this bill becomes law that ByteDance has to either, you know, if it doesn't sell, it's banned in the United States? KHANNA: I don't think it's going to pass first amendment scrutiny because I think there are less restrictive alternatives. We could have made it a crime to transfer Americans' data to an adversarial foreign nation or foreign state interference. But to just ban 170 million Americans who are engaged in speech and livelihood, the federal judge in Montana struck it down. The judges struck it down when Trump tried this. I doubt it survives scrutiny in the Supreme Court. KARL: All right. Congressman Ro Khanna, thank you for joining us here on \"This Week.\" KHANNA: Thank you, Jon. JONATHAN KARL: That was President Biden and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, speaking following Breyer\u2019s 2022 announcement that he was retiring. Justice Breyer is out with a new book titled Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism, not Textualism. And Justice Breyer joins me now right here in the studio. Thank you for joining us. STEPHEN BREYER: Well, thank you very much. KARL: So let me get right at the thesis of the book. You make the case in this fascinating book, sweeping history of the Supreme Court, that justices should consider the practical consequences of a decision such as how those affected by the decision will react. How do you, how does that work in practice? BREYER: In practice, you do your best to figure out what\u2019s going to happen. When it\u2019s most likely to play a major role is when you look at the words of the Constitution and they don\u2019t tell you the answer. Look at the words of a statute. They don\u2019t tell you the answer. And so people, forever, since Chief Justice Marshall in 18-whatever it was, and, Holmes and Brandeis, they say, look at, somebody wrote those words. They had a reason and you\u2019re, you interpret them. KARL: Because, as you know, there\u2019s, there\u2019s an argument that you, that a Justice has to stay within the, the four corners of what\u2019s written on that page. Let\u2019s look at, for instance, in the, in the Dobbs decision, what Justice Alito wrote, \u201cwe do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today\u2019s decision, overruling Roe v--Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we will have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision.\u201d Why is he wrong? BREYER: Really? Because, well, let me give you a very simple case. You may know that if you have a person who has a child who\u2019s handicapped, the school board has to give that child a good education. And if the mother or father think not, they can bring a lawsuit. And if they win that lawsuit, the statute says they\u2019re entitled to their costs. And that was the case. Costs. Does cost include the cost of an educational expert? $29,000? Or does it just mean legal costs? So I say here, why don\u2019t you try this, Mister Textualist? Say it loud. Cost! Now do you know the answer? Say it twice. Cost, cost. Three times. Cost, cost, cost. doesn\u2019t tell you. So the other things the judges have always looked to too. Who wrote those words and what did they have in mind? What was Congress trying to do? What are the consequences if you go one way rather than another way? How does it fit into a set of values that begins with the Constitution? Judges have always done that kind of thing, and it is part of the role of interpreting, a statute or the Constitution. KARL: So let me ask you, though, as a Justice, when you\u2019re going through, a high profile controversial case, are you hearing the noise outside? I mean, I guess literally the protests outside the court, but more, more broadly, are you gauging and thinking about how the world is going to react, how the country is going to react to your decision? BREYER: Yes, I would say that\u2019s in your mind. KARL: And how, how do you do that? Are you how\u2013 BREYER: And when you say, does that lead, does that lead to your deciding x rather than not x? KARL: Yeah. BREYER: Well I can never say never, but rarely. Paul Freund. Professor, great professor, constitutional law said of the role of politics in the courts, in any court. He says no judge. No judge should or will be moved by the temperature of the day, but every judge will be aware of the climate of the season. KARL: So what about our time now, which the political system seems hopelessly divided. The court seems to reflect that division. BREYER: Hard to say. It\u2019s a different, it\u2019s a very complex institution. And where I think the politics that I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019ve not seen politics in the court. And I\u2019ve been a judge for 40 years. I have not seen- KARL: You have not seen politics in the Court. BREYER: Not politics in the sense in which I understood that word when I worked for Senator Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, when he was a senator. KARL: Yeah. BREYER: And I worked there for a few years. But, you get a phone call. Mayor of Worcester. Same time. Secretary of Defense. Which call will Senator Kennedy take first? KARL: Mayor of Worcester. BREYER: Of course. It\u2019s politics. Of course. Of course. I mean, politics was \u201chow popular is this? How unpopular is that? How are we going to get the Republicans to go long, possibly, or some Democrats too. How do we get all the people to the Senate meetings? Where do you want to stand when you\u2019re running for election and and and and.\u201d No, that isn\u2019t there. That just isn\u2019t there. KARL: So how important it was for the Supreme Court when they ruled in the Colorado case about whether or not Trump could be on the ballot, that that was a unanimous decision. BREYER: How important was it? KARL: Yeah. BREYER: Well, don\u2019t talk about that case because you\u2019ll know more about it than me because that\u2019s after I left the court. But in general, that is a very interesting question for me because, it\u2019s very tempting once you\u2019ve written a dissent. Even from a denial of a refusal to hear a case. Yeah, you\u2019ve written the dissent. Your real audience is the other judges but if you fail at that, now you\u2019ve written it, why not let the country have the virtue of seeing your--no, said Holmes. No said, Taft. And Taft said it\u2019s just ego. Keep it. You can, you can join the opinion even though you don\u2019t agree with it. And they did a lot in the Taft court. So I always thought, well, it doesn\u2019t hurt to publish these things. It puts out another point of view. It shows people which they would believe anyway, that not everybody\u2019s in agreement. But there\u2019s also something to be said to try to keep down the extent to which you publicly reveal the disagreement. KARL: Would the justices ever do the kind of horse trading we see in Congress? I mean, I don\u2019t mean to be crass about this, but you have two cases. BREYER: No. KARL: For the court that could determine the presidential election. Decide one it looks better for Donald Trump, the ballot access issue. One, absolute immunity that doesn\u2019t serve his purposes. And they both come out, send the country a message. BREYER: I mean, I mean, you look, it may be that you can find a compromise in the conference or a way of approaching things in the conference that will, in fact, solve a number of problems. And that could be one of the problems. KARL: It would be a very powerful message to the country to see. Two nine-o decisions that can\u2019t be broken down into straight political lines. BREYER: No, the second--Sandra O\u2019Connor, used to say this, the first unwritten rule is nobody speaks twice \u2018til everyone speaks once. Second unwritten rule, tomorrow is another day. You and I were the greatest of allies on case one. Case two. We\u2019re absolutely at loggerheads. So. KARL: But they are looking to how the country is going to, going to receive these decisions. BREYER: Be careful in saying that. I want to, say no, I want to say no, but I can\u2019t say no, never. I mean, you\u2019re up there in that. You\u2019re up there in that building which I can see a picture of. And, and in that building, you are making decisions that will affect people. Of course, knowing that a lot of people are going to read a case leads me to write, if it\u2019s my opinion to write, use certain language that is easy to understand and spend a lot of time trying to explain why. KARL: And you don\u2019t want to contribute to the political divide in the country? BREYER: No, God of course not. But, you\u2019re looking for, for an easy answer. When I\u2019m not being coy and saying, no, there aren\u2019t easy answers.",

            "date": "2024-04-20 19:03:00",
            "content": "Former President Donald Trump had intended to seize his first free Saturday since his first criminal trial began , in New York City, with a large rally in a crucial swing state as well as a fundraiser to shore up his support among the kinds of conservative backers who can help him eat into rival Joe Biden's cash advantage . But those plans were derailed, in part, by a severe weather system rolling over the Southeast -- including North Carolina, where many Trump supporters had already gathered at the Aero Center Wilmington by the time the event was called off amid a severe thunderstorm warning. \"We want to keep everybody safe. That's the most important thing,\" Trump was heard saying in a live phone call blasted out to the crowd gathered at the rally in Wilmington, adding that they will \"just do a rain check.\" The event would have been Trump's first campaign rally since the New York criminal trial started early in the week. He has denied all wrongdoing in the case but is confined to the courtroom most weekdays, except Wednesday, for a proceeding that is expected to take up to two months. The rally's postponement was unexpected but marked something of a setback for Trump in the early phase of his general election fight against President Biden. Trump only narrowly won North Carolina over Biden in 2020; holding it will likely be key to his chances in November. But the trial in New York -- the first of four that Trump faces -- has complicated his campaign schedule, and while he has made some efforts to maximize his time in the city outside of court, including a stop last week at a Harlem bodega after a day of jury selection, he has made notably fewer appearances before voters than Biden in recent weeks. The Biden campaign contends that Trump has been lagging their swing state efforts even before the trial began. MORE: Melania Trump makes rare appearance on 2024 campaign trail Separately on Saturday, Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, held dueling fundraisers in different states, with the former president raising money for his campaign and the Republican Party in North Carolina in the afternoon -- ahead of the canceled rally -- and the former first lady raising money for a conservative LGBTQ+ group at their Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in the evening. Especially for Melania Trump, it was a rare appearance at a fundraising event as she has mostly stayed away from the former president's campaign trail this election cycle and instead only occasionally been seen at private events at his properties. The last two times she was seen publicly were at a major Palm Beach fundraiser for the Trump campaign and Republicans earlier this month, where they said they raised more than $50 million -- and last month at a Palm Beach polling location, where the former president voted in the Florida Republican primary. She headlined the fundraiser for Log Cabin Republicans, the largest 501(c)4 nonprofit organization representing LGBT conservatives in the United States. The fundraiser was co-hosted by a slew of longtime Donald Trump allies and prominent Republican donors, including a former U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who also served as acting director of national intelligence in the Trump administration. He was the first openly gay person to hold a Cabinet-level position in the United States.

Other notable guests and co-hosts included former Trump-endorsed Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz, who lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in the 2022 election; Fox News CEO Roger Ailes' widow, Elizabeth Ailes; longtime Republican donor Saul Fox and Deborah Magowan, the wife of former Giants Chairman Peter Magowan, according to a source and an invitation for the fundraiser.

Ahead of the event Saturday morning, Grenell posted on X that Melania Trump \"will launch the most aggressive campaign we've ever seen from Republicans to win support from gay and lesbian Americans.\" \"We have largely achieved equality in America for gays,\" Grenell wrote, praising the United States as the champion of freedom and liberties and throwing support for Donald Trump. \"He is the best candidate for our safety, security and prosperity,\" he continued. \"He sees you as 100% equal - it's up to you to be responsible, hardworking and successful. Anyone telling you that you are oppressed in America or that you need special side agreements because you're gay is only seeking to control you. Break out from their condescending cult-like manipulations.\" \"You can be anything you want to be in America,\" Grenell wrote, claiming Trump will win a significant amount of the gay vote in 2024. While the former president differentiated himself from some other leading conservatives in embracing gay people, his anti-trans positions have drawn broader outcry from the LGBTQ+ community.

            "content": "The House of Representatives on Saturday passed a series of foreign aid bills that allocate $60.8 billion for Ukraine, $26.4 billion for Israel and $8 billion for Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific allies. Another bill, passed by a vote of 360-58, would force the sale of TikTok and imposes strong sanctions on Iran, China and Russia. An amendment to that bill requires the Treasury Department to submit a report on Iranian assets and sanction exemptions. The four bills will now be sent to the Senate as a package. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Saturday that the Senate will take up the bills on Tuesday afternoon. The bill providing $8 billion in security aid for the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan, passed overwhelmingly in the House by a vote of 385-34-1. Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan was the only member who voted present. The House passed the Ukraine foreign aid bill by a vote of 311-112-1. The House passed the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act by a vote of 366-58. Democrats briefly waved Ukrainian flags during the vote, an action that prompted House Speaker Mike Johnson to remind them it was a violation for members to wave flags on the floor. Earlier, a GOP border security bill failed by a vote of 215-199. It was considered under suspension and did not reach a two-thirds majority. This bill was separate from the four foreign aid bills. After Democrats helped Johnson avoid defeat and advance the legislation on Friday, lawmakers considered amendments and held debate on Saturday before voting on final passage. President Joe Biden thanked House members for passing foreign aid package for Ukraine and Israel and said that the package comes at a \"critical inflection point\" for those nations. \"It comes at a moment of grave urgency, with Israel facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine under continued bombardment from Russia,\" Biden said in a statement Saturday. Biden also pointed to the \"desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, Sudan, Haiti\" included in the funding. Biden hailed the work of leaders in the House and the bipartisan group of lawmakers who he said \"voted to put our national security first,\" and called on the Senate to get the package to his desk. \"I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs,\" Biden added.

Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it,\" Zelenskyy said in a statement. He added, \"The vital U.S. aid bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger. We hope that bills will be supported in the Senate and sent to President Biden's desk. Thank you, America!\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also thanked the House for approving aid.

Thank you friends, thank you America!\" Netanyahu said in a Tweet on X. Could the Speaker get ousted? Johnson's push to get the aid across the finish line has angered some of his conference's far-right members, causing a growing threat to his speakership. A third Republican, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, announced Friday he was joining a looming motion to oust Johnson just after the aid bills advanced. Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced the motion last month, accusing Johnson of \"standing with the Democrats\" after he worked across the aisle to avoid a government shutdown. After Johnson unveiled his plan to forge ahead on foreign aid, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky became the second hard-liner to back Greene's cause. Massie called on Johnson to resign, a suggestion Johnson flatly rejected . Speaker of the House Mike Johnson talks to reporters just after lawmakers pushed a $95 billion national security aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies closer to passage, at the Capitol, April 19, 2024. J. Scott Applewhite/AP All three lawmakers have expressed frustration on Johnson moving ahead with foreign aid without addressing immigration. Though earlier this year, a bipartisan border deal was produced by a group of senators but was quickly deemed dead on arrival by former President Donald Trump and Johnson. \"Our border cannot be an afterthought,\" Gosar said in a statement. \"We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away.\" MORE: Johnson says he won't change rules for ousting speakers after warnings from GOP hard-liners Green did not move to oust the Speaker on Saturday before the House adjourned until April 29, although she claimed her coalition against Johnson is growing. \"I'm actually going to let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents, because I think people have been too obsessed, with voting for foreign wars and the murder industry, here in America that actually understand how angry Americans are,\" Greene said Saturday. Johnson said Friday that the bills are \"not the perfect legislation\" but are \"the best possible product\" under the circumstances. It remains to be seen when, or if, the hard-liners force a vote on the motion to vacate the speaker's chair. If they do, Democrats would potentially need to step in to save Johnson's job. Several Democrats told ABC News Saturday that they're open to saving Speaker Johnson -- if Greene makes good on her threat to call for a vote to oust him -- if Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries gave them the okay, or at minimum didn't oppose the move. ABC News White House correspondent MaryAlice Parks asked the administration if President Joe Biden discussed that possibility with Speaker Johnson in their phone call earlier this week. \"We do not get involved when it comes to leadership in, whether it's the Senate or in the House,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded. \"We're very mindful. That is something that the members, in this case the members in Congress, have to decide on.\" ABC News' Jay O'Brien contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 12:36:00",
            "content": "The House on Friday cleared a key procedural hurdle in passing foreign aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, despite dozens of Republican defections, with Democrats helping Speaker Mike Johnson avoid a stinging defeat. Soon after, a third Republican said he would join a threatened move to oust him. The chamber voted 316-94 to advance the bills, setting up Saturday votes on final passage of $95 billion in foreign assistance that has been held up in a political fight in Washington for several months. Procedural votes such as Friday's are typically passed by the House majority alone, but Democrats stepped in to help push the legislation forward after Republican hard-liners collectively opposed the measure. More Democrats voted to advance the bills than Republicans. \"Democrats, once again, will be the adults in the room,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., during debate ahead of the vote. Leaving the House floor after the vote, Johnson said the four foreign aid bills are \u201cthe best possible product\u201d under the circumstances. \"We look forward to final passage on the bill tomorrow.\" The individual bills provide roughly $26 billion for Israel, $61 billion for Ukraine and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. The measures are similar to legislation passed by a bipartisan group in the Senate back in February, which tied all aid together into one measure. MORE: A TikTok ban is wrapped in Speaker Johnson's foreign aid package: What happens next? A fourth bill packaged into the foreign aid contains conservative priorities such as a TikTok ban bill, sanctions on Iran and legislation to seize Russian assets to help provide funding to Ukraine. \u201cUkraine, Israel and Taiwan are on the frontlines of the struggle to preserve democracy around the world,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., during debate. \u201cIn the case of Ukraine and Israel, these two nations are quite literally in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Pressure increased on lawmakers to pass aid after Iran's unprecedented attacks on Israel over the weekend. Johnson has forged ahead with the foreign aid measures, calling them pivotal, despite pushback from the right-flank of his party and looming threats to his job . A third House Republican, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, announced after Friday's vote his support for the motion to vacate the speaker's chair first introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene last month. In a statement, Gosar expressed frustration with moving ahead on aid to Ukraine rather than providing resources to the souther border. \"We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,\u201d Gosar said. Three Republicans supporting a motion to vacate would be enough to remove Johnson, unless Democrats decide to help defend the Republican speaker. On his way to the House floor for the vote, ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang asked Johnson if he was worried about possibly being ousted. \u201cI don\u2019t worry,\" Johnson responded. \"I just do my job.\" U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol April 16, 2024 in Washington, DC. Win Mcnamee/Getty Images But GOP hard-liners aired their frustrations with Johnson and his approach to this issue during debate. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that the speaker\u2019s cut a deal with the Democrats to fund foreign wars rather than to secure a border,\u201d Rep. Thomas Massie. Massie, R-Ky., earlier this week called on Johnson to resign and joined Greene's motion to vacate. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, also took issue with \"another $100 million to fund war, unpaid for, with zero border security -- under a rule which Republicans should oppose because it is a process predesigned to achieve a desired predetermined outcome, with no border security.\" \"This was all precooked,\" Roy said. \"It's why President Biden and Chuck Schumer are praising it.\" MORE: Johnson says he won't change rules for ousting speakers after warnings from GOP hard-liners Democrats, meanwhile, criticized Republicans for bringing dysfunction to the chamber. \"I would just say to my colleagues, 'Look at what MAGA extremism has gotten you: nothing. Nothing, not a damn thing,'\" Rep. McGovern said, who also told his colleagues,\u201cYou don\u2019t get an award when you\u2019re doing your damn job.\u201d \"We are in a divided government. Nobody is going to get everything they want,\" he added. \"I hope today's vote loosens the grip that MAGA extremism has on this body, and especially when it comes to supporting our allies.\" Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, also a Democratic member of the House Rules Committee, also condemned the delay in getting aid passed: \u201cCongress is finally going to vote ... Why did it take us this long?\" The White House ahead of the vote released a statement of administration policy backing the bills, calling them \"long overdue\" and actions that would \"send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment.\"",

The Title IX update also now offers full protection from all \u201csex-based harassment,\u201d broadening the definition to include \u201csexual violence and unwelcome sex-based conduct that creates a hostile environment by limiting or denying a person\u2019s ability to participate in or benefit from a school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d These changes roll back the narrowed definitions of sexual harassment implemented by former President Donald Trump\u2019s Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

He said he could \"absolutely\" be fair in the case and would not have any concerns about returning a guilty verdict. He is not on social media and receives his news from a spattering of news outlets.

House Republican leaders late Wednesday posted legislative text on a fourth and final bill -- the \"21st Century Peace Through Strength Act\" -- that's part of the proposed aid package. The bill includes a modified version of the TikTok ban that passed the House earlier this year, as well as the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (REPO) for Ukrainians Act, mandatory sanctions on Iran and more. The new bill would give TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance 270 days from the date of enactment to divest from the app or face a U.S. ban, according to the proposed legislation. It would also give the president flexibility to offer a one-time extension of 90 days, ultimately possibly providing ByteDance up to a year to divest from the app, according to the bill. The previous TikTok bill that passed in the House in March gave ByteDance 180 days to divest from the app or face a ban. MORE: How a possible TikTok ban could play out in Congress Senate Commerce Chair Maria Cantwell endorsed the changes to the proposed TikTok ban and said Wednesday in a statement: \"I'm very happy that Speaker Johnson and House leaders incorporated my recommendation to extend the ByteDance divestment period from six months to a year. As I've said, extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done. I support this updated legislation.\" In a post on X Wednesday night, TikTok said: \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually.\" What happens next? In its latest guidance, House GOP leadership advised that votes on the four bills in the aid package are expected in the House on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the last votes for the week expected late Saturday. The aid package includes $26.4 billion for Israel aid, including $4 billion to replenish Israel's Iron Dome defense system; $60.8 billion for Ukraine aid, including $23 billion for replenishing weapons, and $8.1 billion for Indo-Pacific aid.

J. Scott Applewhite/AP If each of the four bills passes and Johnson sends them to the Senate as one package -- as he's indicated he would do, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wouldn't be able to take up the issue of foreign aid without the fourth bill that includes the proposed TikTok ban.

Sources at TikTok told ABC News they were alarmed by how quickly this legislation is moving and were still trying to formulate their response late Wednesday.

The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country,\" a TikTok spokesperson said at the time.",

            "content": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas faced an icy reception from Senate Republicans on Thursday, one day after the swift dismissal of the GOP impeachment case brought against him over his handling of immigration policy and the southern border. Mayorkas was on Capitol Hill to testify about President Joe Biden's 2025 budget proposal and make the case to lawmakers for additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security. But what unfolded on Wednesday was still top of mind for some Republican senators, who blasted the secretary's leadership and scorned Democrats for voting down the impeachment articles against Mayorkas as unconstitutional. \"Yesterday, your impeachment trial ensued in the Senate,\" Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky., said in his opening statement. \"I don't see this as a happy day, or a day I take relish or pleasure in. But it's a sad day. A sad day in the sense that it's come to this. This isn't a debate over policy, it's a debate over malfeasance, a debate over whether you've been telling the truth and whether you've been enforcing the law.\" Paul later added, \"All I can express is disappointment and bewilderment that the Democrats let you get away with it.\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas speaks during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee hearing on the department's budget request on Capitol Hill on April 18, 2024 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images House Republicans impeached Mayorkas in February, accusing him of willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law as well as breach of public trust. The Senate, in party-line votes, discarded the charges as not rising to the level of \"high crime or misdemeanor\" as required under Article II of the Constitution. All Democrats and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders voted to kill the articles and adjourn in the span of three hours after a Republican senator rejected Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's offer for some debate time on the matter. Later, Schumer pushed back on GOP criticism of the dismissal stating their impeachment case was \"hallow, frivolous, political\" and amounted to policy disputes rather than impeachable offenses. MORE: Senate kills Mayorkas impeachment trial, votes both articles 'unconstitutional' Mayorkas had called the impeachment charges \"baseless\" but largely kept his head down as the proceedings unfolded in the House and Senate. On Thursday, he told lawmakers he hadn't read the text of the specific allegations brought against him by GOP lawmakers. \"I have not read the articles of impeachment,\" Mayorkas said as he faced questioning from Sen.

Andrew Harnik/Getty Images In addition to swiping at Mayorkas over impeachment, Republicans pressed him on high numbers of migrant encounters at the southern border and some migrants committed crimes, often pointing to the killing of Laken Riley . Mayorkas declined to comment on the case specifically but said that migrants who \"pose a public safety threat or national security are our highest priority for detention\" but like administration's past, the number of encounters at the border have exceeded the number of detention beds available. MORE: Biden challenges Trump to drop opposition to bipartisan border security bill Democrats often countered Republicans complaints about Mayorkas and the border by criticizing them for blocking a bipartisan deal that included some of the most comprehensive immigration reforms in decades. \"It's interesting the nature of my colleagues' energy and attention when that same energy and attention seemed to lapse when there was an opportunity to do something to provide the kinds of supports, resources and technologies that were requested [and] negotiated in a bipartisan way,\" said Sen. Laphonza Butler, a California Democrat. Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., also took issue with Republicans blocking the legislation from coming to the floor for debate or a vote. \"The American people are smart, so all of the performative chest-pounding today on border security is utterly disingenuous,\" Ossoff said.",

            "date": "2024-04-18 13:53:00",
            "content": "Arizona's Republican lawmakers made clear on Wednesday, despite the controversy engulfing their state with the revival of a strict, Civil War-era abortion ban -- roiling the politics of the key battleground and drawing criticism from top conservatives like Donald Trump -- that it's not the time to move too quickly. \"Legislatures are not built for knee-jerk reactions,\" state House Speaker Ben Toma said during a floor session as the GOP majority, with one exception, blocked a Democratic-led effort to fast-track a bill to repeal the 1864 abortion ban that the Arizona Supreme Court recently ruled is enforceable. \"The last thing we should be doing today is rushing a bill through the legislative process to repeal a law that has been enacted and reaffirmed by the Legislature several times,\" Toma said. The 1864 ban, which supersedes a 15-week abortion ban that was enacted in 2022, after the state Supreme Court ruling last week, blocks all abortions except to save the life of the pregnant woman. Anyone found guilty of violating it will face two to five years in state prison, but Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, said she would not prosecute providers under the law. Though the ban remains temporarily on hold, Mayes said this week that the earliest it could take effect is June 8, \"absent any additional litigation\" or legislative action. While the ban was celebrated by abortion opponents like Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser -- who called the state Supreme Court decision an \"enormous victory for unborn children and their mothers\" -- it was denounced by abortion access advocates and Democrats. On Wednesday, as lawmakers reconvened and Democrats sought to move forward on their repeal proposal, advocates on both sides of the issue gathered inside and outside of the state Capitol. Democrats ultimately need two Republicans to join them in each chamber. In the state Senate, Shawnna Bolick and TJ Shope have said they\u2019ll join the repeal push; in the state House, Democrats are hopeful either David Cook or Tim Dunn will ultimately join them for passage. \"This is a stain on history that this ban even exists -- from a time when the age of consent was 10, from a time when women didn't have the right to vote,\" Arizona state Sen. Eva Burch, a Democrat, told ABC News' Elizabeth Schulze. Burch's GOP colleague Dave Farnsworth took another view. Republican Arizona State Representatives applaud the gallery from the House floor, on April 17, 2024, at the Capitol in Phoenix. House Republicans have again blocked an effort for the chamber to take up legislation that would repeal Arizona's near-total ban on abortions. Matt York/AP \"We have the best law possible on the books right now,\" the state senator told Schulze. Pressed about the ban's lack of exceptions, Farnsworth said, \"Arizona's a pro-life state and that law was put into place by people that believe in the sanctity of life.\" Toma, the House speaker, said during Wednesday's floor session that \"abortion is a complicated topic -- it is ethically, morally complex. I understand that we have deeply held beliefs, and I would ask everyone in this chamber to respect the fact that some of us who believe that abortion is in fact the murder of children.\" That position cuts against some of the most prominent voices in the GOP, who have staked out a more careful stance in an election year in which abortion is expected to be a major issue for voters -- and as abortion access has won out in races elsewhere in the country. Leading Republicans like Trump, former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Senate candidate Kari Lake touted their general support for abortion restrictions but said the 1864 ban goes too far . \"It's all about states' rights and it needs to be straightened out,\" Trump said last week during a campaign stop in Atlanta . \"And I'm sure that the governor and everybody else will bring it back into reason and that will be taken care of.\" The state's Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, has called on state lawmakers to repeal the ban -- but shot back at Trump. \"I'm kind of tired of cleaning up Donald Trump's messes,\" Hobbs said on \"GMA3\" last week. \"But, look, this is just political opportunism from these politicians who this is they are getting exactly what they wanted. Donald Trump bragged about getting rid of Roe v. Wade. And this is the consequence of that.\" Anti-abortion advocates demonstrate prior to an Arizona House of Representatives session at the Arizona State Capitol, on April 17, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona. Rebecca Noble/Getty Images Since Roe was overruled in 2022 by the U.S. Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices named by Trump, as he often notes, 21 states have banned or severely restricted abortion access. However, since 2022, voters across the country have also repeatedly cast ballots protecting abortion rights, and exit polling showed that it was top of mind for some voters, as in Michigan's midterm races.

The campaign has said that they have gathered more than 500,000 signatures -- surpassing the necessary threshold, but will continue to gather signatures \u201cuntil the wheels fall off,\u201d a spokesperson told ABC News. The initiative would amend Arizona's Constitution to prohibit the state from legislating against abortion up until fetal viability, which is around 24 weeks into pregnancy; and it enshrines other abortion protections into law. The Republican-led House counsel in Arizona has, separately, internally proposed a plan to rival the state's abortion rights ballot initiative by adding ballot initiatives of their own in the wake of what they call \"court chaos\" on abortion policy, according to a presentation leaked Monday and shared with ABC News. Those plans could be publicly announced as soon as this week, a Republican lawmaker said Wednesday. Democratic lawmakers also plan to keep pushing repeal. State senators on Wednesday began the process of taking up another bill to undo the 1864 ban, though the earliest that proposal would likely see a vote is on May 1, as it requires two other readings before a vote can be taken and the Legislature is on a once-a-week meeting schedule. Arizona voter Desiree Mayes, a Republican at the Capitol on Wednesday to help apply pressure on lawmakers not to repeal the ban, called Trump's stance on abortion \"inconsistent.\" \"If you really if you really believe that babies in the womb are precious and valuable, they deserve equal protection,\" she said, explaining she doesn't support exceptions for rape or incest. Her message to Arizona Republicans like Lake and others distancing themselves from the 1864 ban? \"You're saying you're pro-life. If you work to repeal this ban, we're going to make sure all your constituents know.\" Republican strategist Barrett Marson said the failure of a quick repeal showed that Trump and Lake \u201conly have so much sway over far-right politicians,\u201d noting that not one vote changed since they weighed in. House Democrats will try again, next week, for another vote on their bill. Arizona state Rep. David Cook voted against fast-tracking the repeal legislation on Wednesday but told ABC News' Phil Lipof in an interview on \"ABC News Live Prime\" that conservatives do intend to get behind repeal in the future. He felt the rules weren't followed Wednesday and he refused to \"roll the speaker,\" or neutralize the speaker\u2019s objections to move to a final vote. \"We made tremendous progress ... in moving forward,\" Cook said of internal deliberations in the GOP state House caucus. Members of Arizona for Abortion Access, the ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the Arizona State Constitution, hold a press conference and protest condemning Arizona House Republicans and the 1864 abortion ban during a recess from a legislative session at the Arizona House of Representatives, on April 17, 2024, in Phoenix, Arizona. Rebecca Noble/Getty Images \"The bottom is that the 1800 law will be repealed,\" he said, with a successful vote likely as soon as next week. Republican state Rep. Matt Gress, who backed repeal on Wednesday, agreed. \"There are enough votes in this chamber to repeal the territorial law. It will happen, it's just a matter of time,\" he said on the floor. But after that, Cook told Lipof, more exceptions need to be enacted in the state's abortion restrictions, including for rape and incest. He defended the timeline so far, telling Lipof, \"We don't need knee-jerk reactions to bypass the rules and the normal order of business. This is not an emergency.\" State Rep. Alexander Kolodin, another Republican, said during Wednesday's floor session that Republicans will roll out their own abortion plan, indicating that action may be through a ballot initiative. \"The ultimate folks who are going to make the call will be the people of the state of Arizona,\" he said. Speaking with ABC News' Elizabeth Schulze, Kolodin suggested he's not worried that the politics of abortion will imperil his party at the ballot box. \"Voters are smart,\" he said. \"They would rather vote for somebody that they respect and disagree with than somebody that doesn't believe in anything.\" Meanwhile, for the women of Arizona seeking abortions, the clock is ticking, providers say. \"We are having conversations with them, letting them know that we're going week by week,\" Dr. DeShawn Taylor told Schulze. \"Because there will come a time when we'll have to stop.\" ABC News' Isabella Murray contributed to this report.",

Wade and more as worrisome. \"The list goes on and on and on,\" she said. \"We must elect President Biden, and that's where our energy has to be.\" Kerry Kennedy also said on \"Good Morning America\" that \"nobody competes for the President Biden when it comes to carrying on the legacies of John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Ted Kennedy.\" MORE: RFK Jr. says he has ruled out Libertarian run for president \"I've listened to him, I know him, I have no idea why anyone thinks he should be president,\" Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of John F.

ABC News A debate over homeless encampments familiar to many communities heads to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, where the justices will confront a rising tide of unhoused Americans and punitive steps cities like Grants Pass are increasingly taking to address it. In 2013, the Grants Pass city council attempted to ban anyone \u201cfrom using a blanket, pillow or cardboard box for protection from the elements\u201d while sleeping outside under threat of civil citation. Two federal courts put the measure on hold after finding it \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d under the Eighth Amendment to ticket people with no alternative to survive.

There are no public homeless shelters in Grants Pass, which has a population of nearly 40,000. An estimated 600 residents are experiencing homelessness.

Johnson, the nation\u2019s highest court is being asked to decide whether ticketing homeless people is patently unconstitutional -- the most significant legal dispute over homelessness in America in more than 40 years. \"This case is about giving cities the tools that they need to address the urgent homelessness crisis,\" said Theane Evangelis, an attorney representing the city before the Supreme Court. \"We believe that it's cruel to allow these conditions to continue, and that cities need to have the flexibility to address all of the circumstances as they work on long term solutions to homelessness.\" The case also has sweeping implications for those living on the streets, advocates say. \u201cThe stakes are really high,\u201d said Ann Olivia, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. \u201cWhat the data tells us, what the evidence tells us, what our humanity tells us, is that moving people around because you don\u2019t want to see them is not the answer.\u201d Since a federal court blocked a ban on public camping by homeless people, fewer unhoused residents have been taking advantage of private shelter beds in Grants Pass, Ore.

It just means that we can't criminalize people while they're homeless.\u201d Helen Cruz, an unhoused Grants Pass, Ore., native, has been challenging city ordinances that impose fines on homeless people.

Over five years living in city parks before a nearby church took her in, she says she received more than $5,000 in camping related fines. \u201cI was holding down two jobs when I was out here, and it's still not enough to be able to rent a place,\u201d she said. \u201cThe terms of low income housing here is $1,000 a month, and that's not workable either.\u201d MORE: Homeless populations vulnerable amid poor air quality and smoke: Advocates Still, from Phoenix, to Los Angeles, to Seattle, city leaders and law enforcement groups -- members of both political parties -- have joined Grants Pass in urging the justices to make it easier to clear tent encampments from the streets. \"Cities need to have these ordinances so that they can help incentivize people to accept offers of help,\" Evangelis said. \"That's what these laws do.\" In its brief to the high court, Grants Pass says lower courts created \u201ca judicial roadblock preventing a comprehensive response to the growth of public encampments in the West\u201d and that the situation threatens \u201ccrime, fires, the reemergence of medieval disease, environmental harm, and record levels of drug overdoses and deaths on public streets.\u201d Grants Pass, Ore., Police Chief Warren Hensmam said law enforcement officers are caught in the middle of the city\u2019s homelessness crisis. ABC News \u201cThe cities are saying they don\u2019t have clarity on this issue,\u201d said Austin VanDerHeyden, a municipal affairs analyst with the Goldwater Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s more \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 to punish someone the way they are currently existing -- the way that they\u2019re being forced to live on the street currently is not compassionate.\u201d Grants Pass Police Chief Warren Hensman said many law enforcement agencies feel caught in the middle and need to be able to enforce the law. \u201cWe have community members in Grants Pass that are afraid to come their parks. We've had shootings in our parks. We have fights in our parks, chronic drug abuse in our parks. So much of our citizenry are not walking through our parks,\u201d he said MORE: Can the VA pull off its 'monumental' bid to end veteran homelessness? \u201cThe problem is much more than the police department.

Some social service providers say local ordinances like a camping ban would provide incentive to homeless people to take advantage of existing resources. The Grants Pass Gospel Rescue Mission offers beds, meals and religious services to unhoused people in need. ABC News \u201cThe big question is, is there nowhere else to go? Or Is there just nowhere else that they want to go?\u201d said Brian Bouteller, director of Grants Pass Gospel Rescue Mission, the only private homeless shelter in town, which has provided warm beds and meals to the needy for more than 40 years. Residents are required to attend religious services; quit smoking, drinking, and drug use; and, give up their pets. The facility -- which has 78 beds to house homeless men -- is only half full. \u201cWe've seen a drop in our residency, and we've seen an increase in people in our parks and freeway underpasses and that kind of stuff in places where they ought not be,\u201d because the courts put the camping ban on hold, he said. State Rep. Dwayne Yunker of Grants Pass, Ore., says cities need to have the ability to enact public camping bans to protect health and safety. ABC News The Supreme Court\u2019s decision, which is expected by the end of June, is expected to lay out guidelines for how cities can regulate homeless encampments going forward. Helen Cruz and Brandon say, for them, a lot is on the line. \u201cIf I don't feel like I belong, I'm going to feel like an outsider, and then I'm going to want to continue doing the same thing,\u201d said Brandon as he erected his tent in centerfield of Morrison Park, \u201cbecause there's no reason to thrive for anything different.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-17 22:33:00",
            "content": "The little-seen, $19,000 lectern at the center of a controversy in Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' office was made available for viewing on Tuesday night -- after a monthslong audit into how the lectern was procured and paid for found that Sanders' staff potentially violated several state laws. The governor's office responded by characterizing the investigation as \"a waste of taxpayer resources and time\" and called the audit report \"deeply flawed.\" \"The facts outlined in the report demonstrate what the governor's office said all along: we followed the law, and the state was fully reimbursed with private funds for the podium, at no cost to the taxpayers,\" Sanders' spokesperson Alexa Henning said in a statement. A Republican state senator had requested the probe last year after the lectern's high price tag sparked scrutiny and captured the national spotlight, including a jab from late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. The purchase only came to light when Matt Campbell, a Little Rock attorney and progressive blogger, called attention to Sanders' office using a state-issued credit card in June 2023 to make a $19,029.25 payment to Beckett Events, a boutique event planning company whose owners are close with the governor. MORE: Sarah Huckabee Sanders defends herself from podium controversy after unusual $19K payment Lawmakers questioned Sanders' staff about the audit's findings in a nearly three-hour hearing at the state Capitol on Tuesday, after the report was sent Monday to prosecuting attorneys. \"I was really hoping that you all would have brought the lectern with you today so we could see it,\" Republican state Rep. Julie Mayberry said at that hearing. \"We all can agree that $19,000 was spent on an item and no one has really seen it.\" Sanders' deputy chief of staff, Judd Deere, told lawmakers that she plans to use the lectern now that the audit is complete, previously having not wanted it to be a distraction. Deere told lawmakers the lectern had been in the governor's office suite at the state Capitol but it was moved Tuesday to a larger conference room, where reporters were again allowed to see it. Despite seven \"areas of noncompliance\" identified in the audit report where the governor's office potentially violated state laws regarding purchasing, state property and government records, Deere said no members of the governor's staff were disciplined for their actions -- \"nor should they be,\" he added. What's next then for the dispute also known as #LecternGate? Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Governor of Arkansas, speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, May 2, 2023. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images Arkansas' Attorney General Tim Griffin, a Republican, has already indicated he won't pursue charges -- enraging critics -- when last week he said that state purchasing laws don't apply to the governor or other executive branch officials, only to state agencies. That means the potential for any criminal charges to be filed would likely fall to Will Jones, the 6th Judicial District prosecuting attorney in Little Rock. Jones said his office is assessing the audit and that their \"review is no different than any other file review\" sent to them. Sanders, a former Trump White House official and daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, has been seen as a rising star in the Republican Party. She was defiant in dismissing the findings, posting a 20-second video edit of the lectern to social media this week that said \"COME AND TAKE IT.\" Here are key takeaways from the audit. Potential violations include tampering with public records Auditors identified seven \"areas of potential noncompliance with state law\" that the governor's office engaged in -- including a member of the governor's office staff shredding the bill of lading for the lectern, which contained details of the shipment and was attached to the delivery crate, potentially violating document retention laws. They were told in interviews that the shredding was inadvertent. Auditors also reported that, at the direction of the governor's deputy chief of staff, an executive assistant added handwritten notes that read \"to be reimbursed\" on two invoices after Campbell, the blogger, asked for documents surrounding the lectern's purchase in a Freedom of Information Act request. State Republicans ultimately repaid the cost of the lectern -- after Campbell called attention to it. According to the audit, other potential violations of budgeting and accounting laws include the purchase being applied to operating expenses, though state law prevents equipment that must be capitalized from being expensed, as well as the lectern being paid for before it was delivered. The governor's office further failed to notify a state agency of the lectern's delivery, as required, and did not create a business expense justification statement on the day it was purchased. Sanders has previously maintained that the lectern's purchase \"went through standard protocol in our office.\" Lectern has no electronic components, despite special features touted When Sanders came under fire last fall for the lectern's price tag, relative to other such furniture and equipment, she told reporters it was custom made for her height, was designed \"to get the best sound quality\" and that it incorporated components to allow multiple media outlets to plug in at the same time. Related Stories Sarah Sanders' #PodiumGate controversy, explained Oct 25, 2:01 PM Audit says Arkansas governor's office potentially violated laws with $19,000 lectern purchase Apr 15, 7:08 PM Arkansas lawmakers question governor's staff about purchase of $19,000 lectern cited by audit Apr 16, 8:22 PM Auditors reported the lectern features no microphone or any electronic elements. It does include a light, they said. The report included a breakdown of the total cost as follows: $11,575 for the lectern itself, $2,500 for a consulting fee, $2,200 for a travel case, $1,225 for freight shipping for the lectern, $975 for freight shipping for the travel case and $554 for a credit card processing fee. The $2,500 consulting fee had not been previously reported but attracted scrutiny on social media when coupled with a detail from the report that the governor's office was considering returning the lectern shortly after its delivery because its height did not meet order specifications. The total $19,000 cost for the podium is notably higher than could be purchased via standard retail means. One retailer previously wrote online that their own lecterns sell for around $7,000. And two political sources outside of Sanders' office with experience producing podiums and the costs associated with them told ABC News that $19,029.25 is more than they would have charged or spent. The lectern purchased by the Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders administration in June 2023 sits in a corner in the Governor's Conference Room at the state Capitol, Sept. 26, 2023, in Little Rock, Ark. Thomas Metthe/Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via AP, FILE Sanders herself didn't participate in the audit, nor did the lectern's vendors Neither Sanders, who previously said she welcomed the audit, nor the lectern vendors cooperated with the probe, according to the audit report. Virginia Beckett and Hannah Stone of Beckett Events did not respond to repeated attempts from auditors to contact them via telephone, certified mail and email, the report said, nor did New York-based Miller's Presentation Furniture, which manufactured the lectern, according to the audit. Beckett and Stone were previously hired by Sanders' office to help with advance planning on her gubernatorial inauguration and the 2023 GOP response to the State of the Union address. They were also at the Paris Air Show last June, which Sanders also attended, the same month the lectern was purchased. Auditors recruited Sanders' office for help reaching out to the vendors during their investigation. Chief legal counsel for the governor's office told lawmakers Tuesday she sent two emails to Beckett Events. Moving forward, an aide to the governor said Tuesday that she doesn't plan on using the vendors again. Neither of the vendors immediately responded to ABC News' request for comment. No evidence state party planned to reimburse state before FOIA request Only after Campbell sought additional information about the five-figure purchase with taxpayer dollars was it reimbursed by the state's Republican Party, with auditors reporting \"there was no indication the governor's office was seeking reimbursement for the cost of the podium and the road case\" before the requests. Sanders' spokesperson said last fall that use of a state credit card for the purchase was \"an accounting error.\" The governor's deputy chief of staff, however, told lawmakers Tuesday that it was decided later on it would be \"preferable\" for the lectern to be paid for with private funds via the state Republican Party. \"This body appropriated money that was available for us to use to purchase items. Later on we determined it was preferable that private funds the governor raised be used to reimburse the state,\" Deere said. \"No taxpayer has been used to purchase this item. So we do not view it as a mistake.\" Notably, the governor's office had also sought approval before the lectern purchase to increase the state credit card's spending limit, as opposed to having the Arkansas Republican Party make the purchase themselves. Campbell, in a statement to ABC News, applauded the auditors' work which he said proved \"what we already knew: that the lectern purchase was illegal and done in the shadiest way imaginable.\" The audit also determined, because of broken protocols, that the lectern belongs to the state of Arkansas. One Arkansas vendor contacted and quoted a far lower lectern price Staffers in Sanders' office told auditors they \"could not recall any other quotes being obtained\" for the lectern. However, auditors found that in March 2023, a staff member contacted an Arkansas-based audio and visual equipment dealer and received quotes for podiums up to $1,500, lighting systems up to $1,000 and sound systems up to $3,000. While auditors said they were ultimately unable to determine the reasonableness of the cost of the podium due to the \"custom specifications,\" \"lack of vendor responses\" and \"lack of documentation,\" they hinted at its high price when compared to similar-style lecterns on the market. \"It should be noted that similar non-customized falcon style podiums can be purchased from online vendors starting at approximately $7,000, as opposed to the $11,575 amount allocated to the custom falcon podium,\" the report said. Arkansas lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed doubt about the lectern's value. \"I don't think the lectern's worth $19,000 or $11,500,\" Republican state Sen. John Payton said on Tuesday. \"But I do think the lesson learned could be worth far more than that if we would just accept the fact that it was bad judgment and it was carelessness.\"",

The package includes $26.4 billion for Israel aid, including $4 billion to replenish Israel's Iron Dome defense system, $60.8 billion for Ukraine aid, including $23 billion for replenishing weapons and $8.1 billion for Indo-Pacific aid. Johnson, who is facing a small revolt within his own conference and will need to rely on Democratic votes to advance the package, told members to expect a final passage vote on the package Saturday evening. But the path to getting there will be an uphill battle and could potentially cost the speaker his gavel. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson does an interview at the Capitol, April 17, 2024. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images MORE: 'I am not resigning': Johnson at risk as he forges ahead on Ukraine, Israel aid Far-right Republicans are mocking Johnson's plan as the #AmericaLast Act \u2013 complaining, for example, that it includes $481 million to pay for housing, medical bills and legal fees for Ukrainian refugees coming to the United States. \"The Republican Speaker of the House is seeking a rule to pass almost $100 billion in foreign aid - while unquestionably, dangerous criminals, terrorists, & fentanyl pour across our border. The border \"vote\" in this package is a watered-down dangerous cover vote. I will oppose,\" Chip Roy, R-Texas, said in a statement on X. Late Wednesday afternoon, Johnson said he wasn't concerned about Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threat to remove him if he went ahead. \"This is not a game. It's not a joke,\" Johnson told reporters. \"We have to do the right thing and I'm going to allow an opportunity for every single member of House to vote their conscience and their will on this. And I think that's the way this institution is supposed to work. And I'm willing to take personal risk for that because we have to do the right thing and history will judge us.\" Asked whether he'd seek Democratic relief if Greene's \"motion to vacate\" is brought up for a vote, Johnson shrugged off the prospect of another battle for the speaker's gavel. \"I do not spend time walking around thinking about the motion to vacate. I have a job to do here. I'm going to do the job. Regardless of personal consequences, that's what we're supposed to do,\" Johnson said. \"If Marjorie brings the motion, she brings the motion and we'll let the chips fall where they may.

You are seriously out of step with Republicans by continuing to pass bills dependent on Democrats.\" But not long after Johnson brushed aside the joint threat from Greene and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie to oust him, Greene said she would not file a privileged resolution on ousting Johnson -- that would require a vote -- before the new foreign aid packages are brought to the floor. \"I can go ahead and rule that out,\" Greene said, adding \"I can. I'm not going to call it before that bill goes to the floor because I think that the bill is definitely going to tell a lot of people what I have been saying.\" While several Republicans are coming out strongly against Johnson's plan, President Joe Biden and top Democrats are urging lawmakers to support the bills. Biden urged the House to pass the package this week, adding that the Senate should \"quickly follow.\" \"I will sign this into law immediately to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends, and we won't let Iran or Russia succeed,\" Biden wrote in a statement Wednesday.

We put America first by demonstrating the power of American leadership \u2013 that we have the strength, resolve, and heart to fight for the most vulnerable people, protect their freedom, and preserve their dignity. I urge swift passage of these bills.\" Republicans are expected to unveil a fourth measure later Wednesday, including the REPO Act, sanctions, the Tik Tok bill, and other measures to \"confront Russia, China and Iran.\" And to appease hardliners, the House will also introduce a separate bill on the border that includes \"the core components of H.R.2, under a separate rule that will allow for amendments.\" If the package clears the House this weekend, the Senate will have a one-week recess to consider how to handle the legislation when the upper chamber returns on April 29.

He has made similar claims about crime in Atlanta as he's railed against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is prosecuting him in Georgia related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. The shop that Trump visited in Harlem on Tuesday, at the invitation of the Bodega Association, he said, was the scene of a homicide in 2022 when the shop's then-clerk Jose Alba fatally stabbed someone whom Alba later said was attacking him and he was acting in self-defense. Surveillance footage from inside the bodega showed the other man, Austin Simon, confronting Alba behind the cash register and shoving him before the two were drawn into a fight.

ABC News Alba was initially charged with murder. The case was controversial, and Bragg's office later dropped the case against Alba, reportedly saying they had insufficient proof to proceed. Despite Trump's rhetoric about crime, statistics from New York City police show violent crime in the city has been falling . Through March 17, homicides were down 19% from the same period in 2023, according to the data -- though homicides previously surged 30% in 2020, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Crime and public safety are key parts of Trump's pitch to voters on the trail, along with attacking President Joe Biden for high inflation and immigration. With the first of his criminal trials now underway, the former president has both complained about how his obligations in court are interfering with his campaign schedule and he has insisted he plans to campaign \"all over\" on the weekends, with rallies \"all over the place.\" The Biden campaign isn't directly commenting on the trial, though they have issued thinly veiled attacks through press releases and sought a contrast by having the president actively campaign in battlegrounds like Pennsylvania this week while Trump sits in court.

I should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states -- North Carolina, Georgia -- campaigning,\" Trump told reporters as he headed back to court on Tuesday, taking advantage of the omnipresent news coverage outside.

Former President Donald Trump visits a New York bodega for a campaign stop after court, April 16, 2024. ABC News In New York, he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree related to money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential bid, in order to stop Daniels from going public about what she claimed was a sexual encounter with him, which he denies. He has pleaded not guilty. As jury selection is underway , Trump said at the bodega that \"anybody that's fair\" is his ideal juror. Asked how he feels about the seven jurors selected so far, he responded, \"I'll let you know in about two months.\" He dodged a question about whether he believes the jurors seated are fair, instead saying there shouldn't be a jury in the first place. Trump also claimed he has not violated the limited gag order imposed by Judge Juan Merchan overseeing the case -- after the prosecution on Monday argued he did so by posting social media attacks on Daniels and his former attorney Michael Cohen, who are potential key witnesses . \"There shouldn't be a gag order,\" Trump said, calling it \"unconstitutional.\" At his bodega stop, he was also asked about recent efforts by two GOP hard-line lawmakers to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson over Johnson's support for voting on foreign aid. \"We'll see what happens with that,\" Trump said. \"I think he's a very good person.\" ABC News' Gabriella Abdul-Hakim, Mary Bruce, Peter Charalambous, Bill Hutchinson and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.",

            "title": "Arizona Republicans block another Democratic effort to repeal 1864 abortion ban",
            "date": "2024-04-17 15:39:00",
            "content": "Arizona Republicans on Wednesday again blocked a Democratic-led effort to repeal a controversial 19th-century ban on almost all abortions in the state , which the Arizona Supreme Court has ruled is enforceable. Democrats in the state House failed to overcome procedural obstacles to advance House Bill 2677, introduced by Democratic state Rep. Stephanie Stahl Hamilton, to repeal the 1864 abortion law, which predates Arizona's statehood and only provides exceptions to save the life of the pregnant woman. Only one of the Republican representatives joined with the Democratic minority, leaving them one vote short of pushing the bill forward. \"The last thing we should be doing today is rushing a bill through the legislative process to repeal a law that has been enacted and reaffirmed by the Legislature several times,\" Speaker Ben Toma, a Republican, said during Wednesday's state House session. \"Abortion is a complicated topic -- it is ethically, morally complex,\" said Toma. \"I understand that we have deeply held beliefs.\" Assistant Minority Leader Oscar De Los Santos, speaking after Toma, said, \"This issue is very simple: Do we support or do we oppose an 1864 territorial abortion ban that includes no exceptions for rape, no exceptions for incest?\" He continued: \"We heard the speaker mention that we shouldn't be rushing this process. Members, we have had since 1864 to repeal this abhorrent law,\" Arizona lawmakers had reconvened on Wednesday after a week's recess, with much attention was on the repeal bill and whether it would move forward. It's unclear how Democrats will next attempt to roll back the strict ban, though members in the state Senate have said they plan to act quickly to take up such efforts in their chamber later Wednesday. The Arizona Supreme Court's ruling reviving the 1864 ban immediately roiled the politics of the key swing state -- being celebrated by abortion opponents and denounced by abortion access advocates and Democrats, while top Republicans, including Donald Trump, said it went too far. The ban remains temporarily on hold but Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said this week that the earliest it could take effect is June 8 -- \"absent any additional litigation\" or legislative action. Anyone found guilty of violating it will face two to five years in state prison. Mayes previously said she would not prosecute providers under the law. Arizona Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, on Wednesday planned to hold rally outside the state Capitol in support of the 1864 ban. The Arizona for Abortion Access coalition was also set to hold a rally outside of the state Capitol. If Arizona lawmakers attempt repeal again, how would it work? Hamilton's repeal bill, which failed to advance on Wednesday, already passed two readings in the Arizona House, setting it up for another attempt at a floor vote -- after one more step. A member will need bring up a motion to waive the normal procedures to consider the bill, since it has not yet been heard in a committee. That waive motion was opposed by nearly all Republicans in the state House majority on Wednesday. But if it ever succeeds, the repeal ban could then go up for a full House vote and would need 31 votes to pass -- a simple majority of legislators in the 60-member chamber. As there are 29 Democratic members in the Arizona House, the bill needs just two Republican votes to succeed. The GOP members to watch are Reps. Matt Gress, David Cook and Tim Dunn. Arizona State Speaker of the House Ben Toma speaks to reporters from the House floor at the Capitol in Phoenix, AZ, April 10, 2024. Matt York/AP Toma, the Arizona House speaker, said last week that lawmakers will not \"rush legislation on a topic of this magnitude without a larger discussion,\" and Republican lawmakers quashed an earlier, Democratic-led effort to quickly repeal the ban. \"We as an elected body are going to take the time needed to listen to our constituents and carefully consider appropriate actions,\" Toma said last week. The Center for Arizona Policy, which has led the fight against abortion rights at the Legislature and successfully lobbied for myriad restrictions, has called on GOP lawmakers not to repeal the 1864 ban. If the Arizona House votes yes on the bill, however, there are still more steps and procedures before the ban is formally repealed and off the books. The proposal, after passing the state House, would then go to the state Senate for yet another vote to waive rules on the bill. Two Republicans are needed to join Democrats in the state Senate as well, and Sens. Shawnna Bolick and T.J. Shope have said they'd support the repeal. The legislation may have to go through further procedural steps given that it has not yet been read in the state Senate. That includes a rule requiring bills be heard on three separate days, so it will likely take at least three more days. To repeal the 1864 ban immediately, lawmakers would have to include an emergency clause in their language but get a two-thirds majority vote for passage. Otherwise, anything approved by the Legislature and signed by the governor does not take effect until 90 days after the end of the legislative session. Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, opposes the ban. \"A law passed in 1864 by 27 men is the reason why my 22-year-old daughter now has fewer rights than I did at her age,\" she wrote on X on Tuesday. \"It's absolutely outrageous. I'm committed to ensuring that future generations have the essential freedoms they deserve.\" She has reiterated that an executive order she signed in 2023 prohibits county attorneys from going above Mayes, the Arizona attorney general, who has said her office is still analyzing legal options and is continuing plans over what to do if litigation efforts are unsuccessful, including how Arizona can support abortion providers. People protest after Arizona's Supreme Court revived a law dating to 1864 that bans abortion in virtually all instances, in Peoria, AZ, April 14, 2024. Caitlin O'Hara/Reuters Potentially dueling ballot measures on abortion The Arizona for Abortion Access campaign is working to get a potential constitutional amendment on the state's ballot in November enshrining abortion access. The campaign has said that they have gathered more than 500,000 signatures -- surpassing the necessary threshold. The proposed amendment would change Arizona's Constitution to prohibit the state from legislating against abortion up until fetal viability, which is around 24 weeks into pregnancy; and it enshrines other abortion protections into law. The Republican-led House counsel in Arizona has, separately, internally proposed a plan to rival the state's abortion rights ballot initiative by adding ballot initiatives of their own in the wake of what they call \"court chaos\" on abortion policy, according to a presentation leaked Monday and shared with ABC News. That proposal includes potentially legislatively-referred ballot initiatives that would compete with the Arizona for Abortion Access measure -- to either return to a 15-week ban that had been in effect before the 1864 ruling or offer a six-week ban, with exceptions in both cases for rape, incest, fetal abnormalities and to save the life of \"the woman\" in the language presented.",

But this time, senators will provide as jurors in the least legitimate, least substantive and most politicized impeachment trial ever in the history of the United States,\" Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor. \"For the sake of the Senate's integrity and to protect impeachment for those rare cases we truly need it, senators should dismiss today's charges,\" Schumer added. Senators are expected to square off, largely along party lines, over whether to proceed with a full-scale trial of Mayorkas over his handling of immigration policy and the southern border when they convene at 1 p.m. EDT. \"When we convene in trial today, to accommodate the wishes of our Republican Senate colleagues, I will seek an agreement for a period of debate time that would allow Republicans to offer a vote on trial resolutions, allow for Republicans to offer points of order and then move to dismiss,\" Schumer said.

But Schumer's facing a fight from Senate Republicans, many of whom are enraged at the suggestion that there wouldn't be a full trial. \"This is raw gut politics,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said during a news conference on Tuesday where he shared the stage with the House impeachment managers. \"What Senator Schumer is going to do tomorrow -- it is fatuous, it is fraudulent and it is an insult to the Senate.

Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., faces a difficult reelection fight in increasingly-red Montana this fall. He hasn't yet said whether or not he would support a motion to dismiss and has repeatedly told reporters he'd wait to make a decision until he's read the articles.

It's unclear what Tester will ultimately decide. But if he sticks with his party, there is ultimately very little Republicans can do to force a trial to go on. That doesn't mean they'll make things easy. If Democrats want to quickly table the trial, Republicans are expected to offer a number of procedural points of order that would force votes and could eat up several hours of floor time. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters after a closed-door lunch Tuesday that there's been an ongoing behind-the-scenes discussion about an agreement that would allow several hours of debate over whether a trial is necessary before a motion to dismiss is ultimately voted on. \"For those of us who would like to have some discussion or debate the potentially offer that we are going to be considering I think offers us an opportunity to build our case,\" Tillis said. Such an agreement would require the consent of all senators, and it's unclear if that could happen. Senators might also try to send the trial to a committee for it to be heard, as they're permitted to do when an impeachment is brought against someone who is not a sitting president. Sen.

            "content": "Attorneys Donald Trump are expected back in court on Monday to defend the $175 million bond in the former president's civil fraud case, days after New York Attorney General Letitia James urged the court to reject the bond and give Trump seven days to find a new one. Judge Arthur Engoron ordered the hearing earlier this month after James took exception to the bond and asked the company behind the bond -- Knight Specialty Insurance Company -- to prove they are sufficiently collateralized to pay the bond if Trump's appeal of the $464 million judgment fails. The bond hearing presents a legal double-header for the former president, who is required to attend the opening statements in his criminal hush money trial on Monday morning. Down the street from the criminal courthouse, Judge Engoron will hear arguments in civil court that could place the former president in financial dire straits if the bond is rejected. MORE: New York AG asks court to reject Trump's $175M bond for civil judgment Trump's bond saga began in February when Engoron ordered the former president and his co-defendants pay $464 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest for engaging in what he found to be a decade of business fraud . Trump attempted to delay the fine, telling an appellate court that finding a surety willing to handle a half-billion-dollar bond was a \"practical impossibility.\" James vowed to begin seizing Trump's assets, including his namesake buildings, if he did not pay the judgment in time. \"If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek judgment enforcement mechanisms in court, and we will ask the judge to seize his assets,\" James said in an interview with ABC News. At the deadline for Trump to pay the judgment, New York's Appellate Division First Department granted the former president's eleventh-hour request to reduce the size of his bond, permitting him to post a bond of $175 million. Former President Donald Trump speaks to guests at a rally, April 2, 2024, in Green Bay, Wis. Scott Olson/Getty Images Days later, Trump and his co-defendants posted a $175 million bond collateralized using $175,304,075 held in a Charles Schwab brokerage account controlled by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. Because the company behind the bond was not admitted in New York, James filed a notice that requires Knight Speciality Insurance to demonstrate they are capable of paying the bond if needed. \"KSIC is a respected, well-capitalized, Delaware-domiciled insurer that has long underwritten surety bonds and other types of insurance placed around the country,\" attorneys for Knight Speciality Insurance and Trump wrote in a filing last week. The filing specified that the bond was secured by more than $175 billion held in a brokerage account controlled by Knight, which independently maintained more than $539 million in their own assets. The filing also stated that the company has access to more than $2 billion in assets through their parent company. \"By any standard, KSIC has therefore provided assurance to the Plaintiff judgment creditor that she can collect the designated amount if the award is affirmed on appeal,\" the filing said. In a filing on Friday, the New York Attorney General argued that the bond itself should be rejected because the defendants failed to prove that Knight could handle \"this extraordinarily large undertaking\" and that the bond was sufficiently collateralized. MORE: In win for Trump, appeals court lowers his bond to $175M in civil fraud case According to James' filing, Knight does not have the exclusive right to control the money in Trump's brokerage account, which could become problematic if the value of Trump's assets in the account dips below $175 million. James also raised issues with Knight's business practices, which she argued should make the company ineligible to do business in New York. \"KSIC is not qualified to act as the surety under this standard because its management has been found by federal authorities to have operated affiliated companies within KSIC's holding company structure in violation of federal law on multiple occasions within the past several years,\" the filing said. Don Hankey -- the chairman of Knight Specialty's parent company -- declined to comment on the attorney general's recent filing on Friday. In an interview with ABC News on April 4, he said he had \"no concerns at all\" about the bond. \"Seldom do our applications or our bonds get turned down. I imagine it is being scrutinized very carefully, and they're checking to make sure all the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed,\" Hankey said. \"It's a large amount for anybody.\"",
