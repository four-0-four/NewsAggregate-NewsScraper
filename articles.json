            "content": "CANBERRA, Australia -- A legendary rugby player has cited the fear and anxiety that has come into his life among the reasons for urging the Australia n government to fund support services and education about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Wally Lewis, dubbed \u201cThe King\u201d when he played rugby league for Queensland state and Australia in the 1980s, made an appeal on behalf of the Concussion and CTE Coalition for millions of dollars in funding during a National Press Club address Tuesday. The 64-year-old Lewis said he\u2019s living with probable CTE, which he described as a type of dementia associated with repeated concussive and sub-concussive blows to the head. Lewis, who worked for decades as a television sports anchor after retiring as a player in the early 1990s, relayed his own experience to get his message across. \u201cThe fear is real. I don\u2019t want anyone to have to live with the fear and anxiety that I live with every day, worried about what I\u2019ve forgotten ... the fear of what my future will look like,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAnd living with the constant fear and anxiety that I\u2019ll let people down \u2013 the people who all my life have been able to rely on me and looked to me for my strength and leadership.\u201d Lewis led Australia\u2019s Kangaroos in 24 international matches, was among the original players to popularize the annual State-of-Origin series, and was included in Australia\u2019s Rugby League Team of the Century in 2008. The National Rugby League has honored him as a so-called \u201cImmortal\u201d of the game. Yet his memories of it aren\u2019t clear. He started playing rugby league as a young boy and also played rugby union at an elite level before embarking on a professional career in rugby league. \u201cIt\u2019s a journey marked by the twin shadows of fear and embarrassment, a journey through the fog of dementia and the erosion of my memory,\u201d he said. \u201cI once had the confidence in myself to succeed, lead a team to victory, captain my country, remember the strengths and weaknesses of opposition teams, organize myself each and every day and feel well and truly in control of my life. \u201cNow, much of that confidence has been taken away from me by the effects of probable CTE dementia.\u201d Lewis said better community awareness on concussion was needed and prevention programs, including a sharper focus on tackling techniques from young players through to professionals. Awareness of CTE and concussion has grown since players in contact football sports, including the National Football League in the United States and rugby union in Britain, launched concussion lawsuits. The Rugby World Cup took place last year against the backdrop of a concussion lawsuit in Britain that had similarities to one settled by the NFL in 2013 at a likely cost of more than $1 billion. CTE, a degenerative brain disease known to cause violent moods, depression, dementia and other cognitive difficulties, can only be diagnosed posthumously. It has been linked to repeated hits to the head endured by football , rugby and hockey players, boxers and members of the military. \u201cAs Wally Lewis I have influence \u2013 I have a platform \u2013 and I intend to use it at every opportunity to bring about change for all Australians like me who are impacted by CTE,\u201d Lewis said, \u201cand to do whatever I can to protect the brains of Australian children from CTE.\u201d ___ AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby",

            "title": "When red-hot isn't enough: New government heat risk tool sets magenta as most dangerous level",
            "date": "2024-04-22 16:20:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- Forget about red hot. A new color-coded heat warning system relies on magenta to alert Americans to the most dangerous conditions they may see this summer. The National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday \u2014 Earth Day \u2014 presented a new online heat risk system that combines meteorological and medical risk factors with a seven-day forecast that's simplified and color-coded for a warming world of worsening heat waves. \u201cFor the first time we\u2019ll be able to know how hot is too hot for health and not just for today but for coming weeks,\u201d Dr. Ari Bernstein, director of the National Center for Environmental Health, said at a joint news conference by government health and weather agencies. Magenta is the worst and deadliest of five heat threat categories, hitting everybody with what the agencies are calling \u201crare and/or long-duration extreme heat with little to no overnight relief.\u201d It's a step higher than red, considered a major risk, which hurts anyone without adequate cooling and hydration and has impacts reverberating through the health care system and some industries. Red is used when a day falls within the top 5% hottest in a particular location for a particular date; when other factors come into play, the alert level may bump even higher to magenta, weather service officials said. On the other hand, pale green is little to no risk. Yellow is minor risk, mostly to the very young, old, sick and pregnant. Orange is moderate risk, mostly hurting people who are sensitive to heat, especially those without cooling, such as the homeless. The five categories rest on strict science-set numerical thresholds, like the Saffir Simpson hurricane scale that is familiar for its Category 1 through 5 terminology, though the heat version is specific to location, said National Weather Service Director Ken Graham. The thresholds were calculated using local weather data, local climatology that shows what people are used to at certain locations at each time of year, and localized heath and medical data for when heat illnesses and deaths show up in the area, he said. \u201cHeat is a threat to our health,\u201d CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said. She said last year more than 120,000 people were taken to the emergency room in the United States because of heat. Last year was one of the deadliest years in decades for heat, according to government records. Heat is by far the No. 1 weather cause of death in the United States, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Rick Spinrad, citing CDC data of 1,200 deaths per year. Last year was the hottest year on record globally. Both the weather service and CDC will put versions of the tool on their websites. Enter a ZIP code on the CDC dashboard to get more focus on health risks and air quality and zoom in on the weather service map online for more detailed forecasts and explanations. Both versions include heat risk for the next seven days and there is a Spanish edition. The CDC site is https://www.cdc.gov/heatrisk and the weather service version is https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/heatrisk/ There are numerous other meteorological indexes for heat, Graham said. Those include the heat index, which factors in humidity; wet bulb globe temperature, which is aimed at outdoors heat stress in the sun; and universal thermal climate index, which brings in radiation and other urban heat factors. \u201cThis is a way to simplify that,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou've got to be able to simplify the stuff so that people actually want to look at it first of all and most importantly understand it.\u201d A version of the heat risk map has been in use in California and other parts of the West for about a decade, he said. Health officials Cohen and Bernstein said even as heat gets worse with climate change, society can try to reduce deaths by better warnings and better planning. Doctors should talk with people before the summer begins about what vulnerable people should do in advance before heat waves, they said. For example, some heart medications interact with outdoor heat and people shouldn't stop taking their medications, but they could take other precautions, as can teenagers with asthma, said Bernstein, a pediatrician by training. Those precautions will be needed soon, Graham said. The Weather Service's seasonal forecast for May and June shows likely above-average temperatures for much of the United States, Graham said. \u201cSo as summer approaches, it's going to be as hot as ever and even more so if we get above average.\u201d \u201cHeat waves are getting hotter, longer, more frequent and you're getting less relief at night,\u201d Graham said, citing numerous studies in the past decade. \u201cSo it's becoming increasingly serious.\u201d __ Read more of AP\u2019s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "title": "Haiti health system nears collapse as medicine dwindles, gangs attack hospitals and ports stay shut",
            "date": "2024-04-23 00:05:00",
            "content": "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- On a recent morning at a hospital in the heart of gang territory in Haiti \u2019s capital, a woman began convulsing before her body went limp as a doctor and two nurses raced to save her. They stuck electrodes to her chest and flipped on an oxygen machine while keeping their eyes on a computer screen that reflected a dangerously low oxygen level of 84%. No one knew what was wrong with her. Even more worrisome, the Doctors Without Borders hospital in the Cite Soleil slum was running low on key medicine to treat convulsions. \u201cThe medication she really needs, we barely have,\u201d said Dr. Rachel Lavigne, a physician with the medical aid group. It\u2019s a familiar scene repeated daily at hospitals and clinics across Port-au-Prince, where life-saving medication and equipment is dwindling or altogether absent as brutal gangs tighten their grip on the capital and beyond. They have blocked roads, forced the closure of the main international airport in early March and paralyzed operations at the country\u2019s largest seaport, where containers filled with key supplies remain stuck. \u201cEverything is crashing,\u201d Lavigne said. Haiti\u2019s health system has long been fragile, but it\u2019s now nearing total collapse after gangs launched coordinated attacks on Feb. 29, targeting critical infrastructure in the capital and beyond. The violence has forced several medical institutions and dialysis centers to close, including Haiti\u2019s largest public hospital. Located in downtown Port-au-Prince, the Hospital of the State University of Haiti was supposed to reopen on April 1 after closing when the attack began, but gangs have infiltrated it. One of the few institutions still operating is Peace University Hospital, located south of the shuttered airport. From Feb. 29 to April 15, the hospital treated some 200 patients with gunshot wounds, and its beds remain full. \u201cWe urgently need fuel because we operate using generators. Otherwise we run the risk of closing our doors,\u201d hospital director Dr. Paul Junior Fontilus said in a statement. More than 2,500 people were killed or wounded across Haiti from January to March, a more than 50% increase compared with the same period last year, according to a recent U.N. report. Even if a hospital is open, sometimes there is little or no medical staff because gang violence erupts daily in Port-au-Prince, forcing doctors and nurses to stay at home or turn around if they encounter blocked roads manned by heavily armed men. The spiraling chaos has left a growing number of patients with cancer, AIDS and other serious illnesses with little to no recourse, with gangs also looting and setting fire to pharmacies in the capital\u2019s downtown area. Doctors Without Borders itself has run out of many medications used to treat diabetes and high blood pressure, and asthma inhalers that help prevent deadly attacks are nowhere to be found in the capital, Lavigne said. At the Doctors Without Borders hospital, medical staff recently tried to save a boy with a severe asthma attack by giving him oxygen, she said. That didn\u2019t work, and neither did another type of medication. Finally, they ended up injecting him with adrenaline, which is used in emergencies to treat anaphylactic shock. \u201cWe improvise and we do our best for the people here,\u201d Lavigne said. People\u2019s health is worsening because the daily medication they need for their chronic conditions is not available, warned Doctors Without Borders project coordinator Jacob Burns. \u201cIt becomes acute and then they run out of options,\u201d he said. \u201cFor certain people, there are very, very few options right now.\u201d Despite the pressing need for medical care, the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Cite Soleil has been forced to cut the number of outpatients it treats daily from 150 to 50, Burns said, though all emergencies are attended to. Scores of people line up outside the hospital each day and risk being shot by gang members who control the area as they await medical care. Everyone is allowed to enter the hospital compound, but medical staff set up a triage to determine which 50 people will be seen. Those with less urgent needs are asked to return another day, Burns said. On Friday morning, 51-year-old Jean Marc Baptiste shuffled into the emergency room with a bloody bandage on his right hand. He said police in an armored vehicle shot him the previous day as he was collecting wood to sell as kindling in an area controlled by gangs. Once inside, nurses removed the bandage to reveal a gaping wound in his thumb as he cried out in pain. Lavigne told him he needed a plastic surgeon, which the hospital does not have, and ordered X-rays to ensure there was no fracture. On average, the Cite Soleil hospital sees three wounded people a day, but sometimes it\u2019s up to 14 now, staff said. Recently, five people wounded by bullets arrived at the hospital after spending all night inside a public bus that couldn\u2019t move because of heavy gunfire, Burns said. \u201cCite Soleil was long the epicenter of violence,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now violence is so widespread that it\u2019s become a problem for everyone.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-22 13:38:00",
            "content": "In the two years before the World Anti-Doping Agency signed off on clearing 23 Chinese swimmers of intentionally taking performance enhancers, that country's government contributed nearly $2 million above its yearly requirements to WADA programs, including one designed to strengthen the agency's investigations and intelligence unit. The Associated Press obtained confidential minutes from meetings of the WADA executive committee that lists China as having given $993,000 in 2018 and $992,000 in 2019, two years that led to one of its Olympians being elected as one of the agency's vice presidents. The Chinese contributions were part of a pattern that illustrates the country\u2019s growing influence on the drug-fighting agency at about the same time WADA\u2019s relationship with its biggest contributor, the United States, was fraying. There is no indication from the documents AP reviewed that China donated the money in expectation of a quid pro quo to gloss over positive drug tests. In fact, WADA didn't hide the extra funding; it put out a little-noticed news release in December 2020 announcing China's $992,000 donation. \"All this was done in total transparency,\" WADA director general Olivier Niggli said Monday during a news conference to discuss the case. \u201cAnd frankly, the (question) has absolutely nothing to do with what we are discussing today. So, the optics is a question (I appreciate), but I have absolutely no problem with the relationship we have with China.\u201d The main part of WADA\u2019s budget each year comes from a 50-50 split between governments of the world and the Olympic movement. China\u2019s additional contributions came on top of $430,000 its government supplied WADA as part of the routine payments in 2019. The U.S. gave the largest regular contribution that year \u2014 $2.51 million, but that came as its relationship with WADA was growing tense. By 2021, the U.S. was sparring with WADA over passage of a new law written to combat doping in response to the long-running drug scandal in Russia. It also was withholding part of its payment, with the country\u2019s top government representative in the world anti-doping structure referencing \u201csorry state of affairs\u201d that existed in WADA\u2019s governance. While the U.S. tangled with WADA, China was chipping in on what was essentially a fundraising effort by WADA to ramp up its fledgling intelligence and investigations (I & I) program, which played a role in the current case. One of the documents obtained by the AP references committee member Ugur Erdener briefing the panel in September 2020 about the program and telling members that \u201conly China, as far as he knew, had made a donation of 500,000 US dollars.\u201d That amount would grow to $992,000 by the end of 2020 \u2014 nearly three-quarters of the money received for the program to that point, and an amount surpassed only by India when it contributed $1 million a year later, according to WADA's 2021 annual report. That China was about to host the 2022 Winter Olympics and India was on board to host a key IOC meeting could have played into the donations. The giving also came in the leadup to the November 2019 election of IOC member Yang Yang of China to WADA vice president. Yang was elected to her second three-year term in 2022. Last year, according to another WADA document seen by the AP, the Chinese sports products company ANTA Sports signed a three-year deal to provide WADA-branded sports apparel. Among the other groups ANTA sponsors are China's national swimming federation and the Chinese Olympic committee. Last week, reporting by The New York Times and German broadcaster ARD revealed that WADA had cleared the Chinese swimmers of doping violations by accepting the Chinese anti-doping agency's reasoning that the athletes had been exposed to a banned heart medication through contamination. There was no public notice of the case, nor any provisional suspension, both of which are called for in the world anti-doping code. The quiet handling of the cases occurred about seven months before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Even a provisional suspension at that time could have put those swimmers' eligibility for the games in jeopardy. WADA used its news conference to defend and explain its process, saying in essence there was no effective way to win a case based on countering China's claims that the swimmers had been subject to contamination. \u201cIn the absence of any evidence of any sort of misconduct ... I'm very confident we would have had close to a 0% chance in establishing\u201d a case that the swimmers intentionally cheated, WADA general counsel Ross Wenzel explained. Of the 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive, 13 competed in Tokyo and four of those 13 won medals. Many of the athletes still compete for China and are expected to swim at this year's Paris Olympics. According to the executive committee notes, the program China donated to was part of an effort to strengthen WADA's I & I activities and had potential for up to $5 million in funding. At a 2019 meeting, IOC President Thomas Bach had committed the Olympic body to matching government contributions up to $2.5 million. But about a year later, according to Erdener, the Turkish IOC member who reported on the fundraising, only China had stepped up to pay. By the end of 2021, according to WADA's annual report, the I & I program had received a total of $3.53 million from nine countries' governments. In addition to India's $1 million, Canada, which is the home of WADA, donated $748,000. Saudi Arabia gave $500,000, and none of the other five countries gave more than $108,000. ___ AP Sports Writer Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed to this report. ___ AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

            "title": "Jury: BNSF Railway contributed to 2 deaths in Montana town where asbestos sickened thousands",
            "date": "2024-04-22 17:01:00",
            "content": "HELENA, Mont. -- A federal jury on Monday said BNSF Railway contributed to the deaths of two people who were exposed to asbestos decades ago when tainted mining material was shipped through a Montana town where thousands have been sickened. The jury awarded $4 million each in compensatory damages to the estates of the two plaintiffs, who died in 2020. Jurors said asbestos-contaminated vermiculite that spilled in the rail yard in the town of Libby, Montana was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs\u2019 illnesses and deaths. Family members of the two victims hugged their attorneys after the verdict was announced. An attorney for the plaintiffs said the ruling brought some accountability, but one family member told The Associated Press that no amount of money would replace her lost sister. \u201cI\u2019d rather have her than all the money in the world,\u201d Judith Hemphill said of her sister, Joyce Walder. The vermiculite from Libby has high concentrations of naturally-occurring asbestos and was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes in homes and businesses across the U.S. After being mined from a mountaintop outside town, it was loaded onto rail cars that sometimes spilled the material in the Libby rail yard. Residents have described piles of vermiculite being stored in the yard and dust from the facility blowing through downtown Libby. The jury did not find that BNSF acted intentionally or with indifference so no punitive damages were awarded. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired BNSF in 2010, two decades after the W.R. Grace & Co. vermiculite mine near Libby shut down and stopped shipping the contaminated mineral. The estates of the two victims argued that the railroad knew the asbestos-tainted vermiculite was dangerous and failed to clean it up. Both lived near the rail yard decades ago and died from mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer linked to asbestos exposure. The pollution in Libby has been cleaned up, largely at public expense. W.R. Grace, which played a central role in the town\u2019s tragedy, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and paid $1.8 billion into an asbestos trust fund to settle future cases. Yet the long timeframe over which asbestos-related diseases develop means people previously exposed are likely to continue getting sick for years to come, health officials say. The case in federal civil court over the two deaths was the first of numerous lawsuits against the Texas-based railroad corporation to reach trial over its past operations in Libby. Current and former residents of the small town near the U.S.-Canada border want BNSF held accountable, accusing it of playing a role in asbestos exposure that health officials say has killed several hundred people and sickened thousands. \u201cThis is good news. This is the first community exposure case that will hold the railroad accountable for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Mark Lanier, an attorney for Walder and Hemphill's estates. The railroad was considering whether to appeal, said a BNSF spokesperson, who referred to it as a \u201cvery sad case.\u201d \"They (the jury) had the difficult task of evaluating conduct that occurred more than 50 years ago, before BNSF ever existed,\u201d said Kendall Sloan, the railroad's director of external communications. BNSF attorney Chad Knight told jurors last week the railroad's employees didn\u2019t know the vermiculite was filled with hazardous microscopic asbestos fibers. \u201cIn the \u201850s, \u201960s and '70s no one in the public suspected there might be health concerns,\u201d Knight said Friday. The railroad\u2019s experts also suggested during the trial that the plaintiffs could have been exposed to asbestos elsewhere. The railroad said it was obliged under law to ship the vermiculite, which was used in insulation and for other commercial purposes, and that W.R. Grace employees had concealed the health hazards from the railroad. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris had instructed the jury it could only find the railroad negligent based on its actions in the Libby Railyard, not for hauling the vermiculite. Former Libby resident Bill Johnston, who followed the trial, said he was glad the victims' estates got a substantial award. Johnston, 67, recalled playing in piles of vermiculite at the rail yard as a child and helping his father add piles of the material to their home garden, where it was used as a soil amendment. He, his two siblings and their parents have all been diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases, Johnston said Monday. \u201cThey didn't do anything intentionally to cause this harm to their body. Other people knew about it and didn't care,\u201d he said of Libby asbestos victims. \u201cWhat's that worth? It's hard to put a value on that. But when you say you're going to die prematurely or the life you have left is going to be tethered to an oxygen bottle, there should be some value that makes their life easier in the end.\u201d BNSF was formed in 1995 from the merger of Burlington Northern railroad, which operated in Libby for decades, and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. Looming over the proceedings was W.R. Grace, which operated the mountaintop vermiculite mine 7 miles (11 kilometers) outside of Libby until it closed in 1990. Morris referred to the chemical company as \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d during the BNSF trial and reminded jurors repeatedly that the case was about the railroad\u2019s conduct, not W.R. Grace\u2019s separate liability. Federal prosecutors in 2005 indicted W. R. Grace and executives from the company on criminal charges over the contamination in Libby. A jury acquitted them following a 2009 trial. The Environmental Protection Agency descended on Libby after 1999 news reports of illnesses and deaths among mine workers and their families. In 2009 the agency declared in Libby the nation\u2019s first ever public health emergency under the federal Superfund cleanup program. A second trial against the railroad over the death of a Libby resident is scheduled for May in federal court in Missoula.",

            "date": "2024-04-23 00:19:00",
            "content": "TAMPA, Fla. -- TAMPA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Tuesday blamed Donald Trump for Florida's upcoming abortion ban and other restrictions across the country that have imperiled access to care for pregnant women, arguing Trump has created a \u201chealthcare crisis for women all over this country.\u201d Biden's campaign events at Hillsborough Community College in Tampa placed the president in the epicenter of the latest battle over abortion restrictions. The state\u2019s six-week abortion ban is poised to go into effect May 1 at the same time that Florida voters are gearing up for a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution. Biden said that millions of women are facing \u201cpain and cruelty.\" \u201cBut it\u2019s not inevitable. We can stop it. When you vote, we can stop it,\" he said. The president is seeking to capitalize on the unceasing momentum against abortion restrictions nationwide to not only buoy his reelection bid in battleground states he won in 2020, but also to go on the offensive against Trump in states that the presumptive Republican nominee won four years ago. One of those states is Florida, where Biden lost to Trump by 3.3 percentage points. On Tuesday, he chronicled increasing medical concerns for women in the two years since the Supreme Court ended federal abortion protections. \u201cThere was one person who was responsible for this nightmare,\" Biden said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s acknowledged it and he brags about it \u2014 Donald Trump.\u201d Biden said Trump, who has publicly waffled on his abortion views, and of late has said abortion is a matter for states to decide, is concerned voters will now hold him accountable. \u201cFolks, the bad news for Trump is that we are going to hold him accountable,\u201d Biden said. At the same time, advocates on the ground say support for abortion access cuts across parties. They're intent on making the issue as nonpartisan as possible as they work to scrounge up at least 60% support from voters for the ballot initiative. That could mean in some cases, Florida voters would split their tickets, backing GOP candidates while supporting the abortion measure. \u201cI think that normal people are aware that a candidate campaign is really different than a ballot initiative,\u201d said Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for Floridians Protecting Freedom, which gathered signatures to put the abortion question before voters. \u201cYou can vote for your preferred candidate of any political party and still not agree with them on every single issue.\" Brenzel continued, \u201cThis gives voters an opportunity to have their message heard on one policy platform.\u201d On the same day the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the ballot measure could go before voters, it also upheld the state\u2019s 15-week abortion ban. That subsequently cleared the way for the new ban on the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, which is often before women know they are pregnant, to go into effect next week. Organizers of the abortion ballot measure say they collected nearly 1.5 million signatures to put the issue before voters, although the state stopped counting at just under a million. Roughly 891,500 signatures were required. Of the total number of signatures, about 35% were from either registered Republican voters or those not affiliated with a party, organizers said. State Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat, said if the abortion ballot initiative becomes branded as a partisan effort, \u201cit just makes it more challenging to reach 60%.\u201d Eskamani, who worked at Planned Parenthood before running for political office, said she is encouraging the Biden administration to focus broadly on the impact of a six-week ban and let the ballot measure speak for itself. \u201cAt the end of the day, the ballot initiative is going to be a multimillion-dollar campaign that stands very strongly on its own,\u201d Eskamani said. Trump's campaign did not respond to a question on whether the former president, a Florida voter, would oppose or support the ballot measure. In an NBC interview last September, Trump called Florida\u2019s six-week ban \u201cterrible.\u201d But he has repeatedly highlighted the three conservative-leaning justices he chose for the high court who cleared the way to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Republicans were dismissive of the Biden campaign and the broader Democratic Party\u2019s efforts to use abortion as a political cudgel, arguing that other issues will matter more with voters in November. \u201cBiden must have forgotten that thousands of Americans have fled from extremist Democrat policies to prosperous and pro-life states like Florida,\" said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley. Still, Trump and other Republicans are aware that voter backlash against increasing restrictions could be a serious liability this fall. Abortion-rights supporters have won every time the issue has been put before voters, including in solidly conservative states such as Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio. Last month, a Democrat in a suburban state House district in Alabama flipped the seat from Republican control by campaigning on abortion rights, weeks after in vitro fertilization services had been paused in the state. Nikki Fried, the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said Florida will be a competitive state on the presidential level \u201cbecause of the extremism that has come out of Florida.\u201d No Democrat has won the state on the presidential level since 2012, but state party officials have found some glimmers of political change in vastly smaller races, such as the open Jacksonville mayor\u2019s race last May that saw a Democrat win in what was once a solidly Republican city. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, said at a news conference before the visit that the abortion amendment was written in a way to deliberately mislead voters, an argument that the state Supreme Court disagreed with when it approved the ballot language. \u201cAll I can tell you is Floridians are not buying what Joe Biden is selling and in November we\u2019re going to play an instrumental role in sending him back to Delaware where he belongs,\" he said. ___ Associated Press writers Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee and Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 16:21:00",
            "content": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia hospital has confirmed the first known case of measles in the state since 2009, health officials said Monday. The Monongalia County Health Department said WVU Medicine alerted officials Sunday that an adult patient living in the county tested positive for the viral infection. Health officials have not pinpointed exactly where and how the patient was exposed but said the person had recently traveled abroad. The patient \u2014 who was partially vaccinated against measles, having received one of two doses \u2014 had developed symptoms, sought medical treatment through the WVU Medicine system and was instructed to stay home while awaiting lab results. One of the world\u2019s most contagious diseases, measles can lead to potentially serious complications. Dr. Brian H. Huggins, the county health department's incoming health officer, said the department is working with the hospital to identify people who came into contact with the patient. \u201cWe really want to emphasize that this is an illness that people should take very seriously,\u201d Huggins said. Nationwide, measles cases this year already are nearly double the total for all of 2023, raising health experts\u2019 concerns about the preventable, once-common childhood virus. Health officials have confirmed measles cases in at least 17 other states so far this year, including cases in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented 113 cases as of April 5. There have been seven outbreaks and most U.S. cases \u2014 73% \u2014 are linked to those flare-ups. Still, the count is lower than some recent years: 2014 saw 667 cases and 2019 had 1,274. Most U.S. cases are brought into the country by people who traveled where measles is far more common. Huggins said West Virginia has not seen a case since 2009 largely due to its strict school vaccination laws. West Virginia is one of a handful of states that allows only medical exemptions to vaccine requirements. Last month, Republican Gov. Jim Justice broke with West Virginia\u2019s GOP-majority Legislature to veto a bill that would have allowed some students who don\u2019t attend traditional public schools or don't participate in sports and other group extracurricular activities to be exempt from vaccinations typically required for children.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 14:35:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The medical records of women will be shielded from criminal investigations if they cross state lines to seek an abortion where it is legal, under a new rule that the Biden administration finalized Monday. The regulation, which is intended to protect women who live in states where abortion is illegal from prosecution, is almost certain to face legal challenges from anti-abortion advocates and criticism from abortion-rights advocates that it does not go far enough. \u201cNo one should have their medical records used against them, their doctor or their loved one just because they sought or received lawful reproductive health care ,\u201d Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House Gender Policy Council, told reporters on Monday. The new regulation is an update to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which prohibits medical providers and health insurers from divulging medical information about patients. Typically, however, law enforcement can access those records for investigations. In states with strict abortion rules, the federal regulation would essentially prohibit state or local officials from gathering medical records related to reproductive health care for a civil, criminal or administrative investigation from providers or health insurers in a state where abortion remains legal. In theory, it would provide the most cover to women who leave states with strict bans to seek an abortion from a medical provider in a state that allows it. \u201cAs someone who does see patients who travel from all across the country at our health center in D.C., it's a reality. I've had patients ask ... are there going to be consequences for me when I go home?\" said Dr. Serina Floyd, an OB-GYN who provides abortions in Washington. Women who also seek fertility, contraception or miscarriage care will also be protected, the nation\u2019s top health official Xavier Becerra said Monday. A group of 19 Republican Attorneys General, all from states with strict abortion laws, urged the Health and Human Services agency to ditch the rule when a draft was released last year. The regulation \u201cwould unlawfully interfere with states\" authority to enforce their laws, and does not serve any legitimate need,\u201d they wrote in a letter to HHS last year. \u201cRelying as it does on a false view of state regulation of abortion, the proposed rule is a solution in search of a problem,\" the letter said. But the new regulation does not go as far as protecting women from criminal investigations when they order abortion pills online, as has become increasingly common. For example, it would not safeguard medical records of a patient who orders an abortion pill while at her home in a state like Mississippi, where abortion is mostly banned, from a provider in Illinois, where abortion is legal. The rule also does not require law enforcement officials to obtain a warrant for any medical records of patients, a rule change some Democrats had sought from the administration. Instead, law enforcement can seek a subpoena, court order or an administrative request to obtain medical records. Becerra acknowledged to reporters that the regulation has limitations \u2014 and may be challenged legally. \u201cUntil we have a national law that reinstitutes Roe v. Wade, we're going to have issues,\u201d Becerra said. \u201cBut that doesn't stop us from doing everything we can to protect every Americans' right to access the care they need.\u201d At least 22 Democratic-controlled states have laws or executive orders that seek to protect medical providers or patients who participate in abortion from investigations by law enforcement in states with bans. Medical providers in some of those states are prescribing abortion pills via telehealth to women in states with abortion bans. It\u2019s not clear that public officials have sought those medical records of patients around abortion. But last year, Texas officials demanded records from at least two out-of-state health centers that provide gender-affirming care. Texas, like most other Republican-controlled states, has a ban on gender-affirming care for minors. ___ Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed.",

            "content": "DALLAS -- DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is dropping a request for a Seattle hospital to hand over records regarding gender-affirming treatment potentially given to children from Texas as part of a lawsuit settlement announced Monday. Seattle Children's Hospital filed the lawsuit against Paxton's office in December in response to the Republican appearing to go beyond state borders to investigate transgender health care . Paxton, a staunch conservative who has helped drive GOP efforts that target the rights of trans people, sent similar letters to Texas hospitals last year. The Seattle hospital said in a statement that it had \u201csuccessfully fought\u201d the \u201coverreaching demands to obtain confidential patient information.\u201d A judge in Austin dismissed the lawsuit Friday, saying the parties had settled their dispute. Texas is among states that have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. The hospital's lawsuit included a copy of the letter from Paxton\u2019s office, which among other requests asked the hospital to produce records identifying medication given to children who live in Texas; the number of Texas children who received treatment; and documents that identified the \u201cstandard protocol or guidance\u201d used for treatment. As part of the settlement, according to court records, the parties agreed that Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital would withdraw its registration to transact business in Texas. But a hospital spokesperson said in a statement that they don't operate health care facilities or provide gender-affirming care in Texas. In court records, the hospital had previously stated that it had a \u201climited number\u201d of people who work remotely and live in Texas but that none were involved in gender-affirming care. It also said it did not advertise its services in Texas. \u201cWhen we merely began asking questions, they decided to leave the State of Texas and forfeit the opportunity to do business here,\" Paxton said in a news release Monday. He said Texas will \u201cvigorously protect\u201d children from gender-affirming treatment that he called \u201cdamaging.\u201d The Texas law prevents transgender minors from accessing hormone therapies, puberty blockers and transition surgeries, even though medical experts say such surgical procedures are rarely performed on children. In Washington, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee has signed a law that aims to protects minors seeking gender-affirming care there, part of a wave of legislation in Democratic-led states intended to give refuge to those seeking gender-affirming treatment.",

            "title": "New federal rule bars transgender school bathroom bans, but it likely isn't the final word",
            "date": "2024-04-23 00:28:00",
            "content": "A new rule from President Joe Biden's administration blocking blanket policies to keep transgender students from using school bathrooms that align with their gender identity could conflict with laws in Republican-controlled states. The clash over bathroom policy and other elements of a federal regulation finalized last week could set the stage for another wave of legal battles over how transgender kids should be treated in the U.S. In recent years, transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance in the U.S. \u2014 and some conservative officials have pushed back. Most GOP-controlled states now have laws reining in their rights. Measures include laws to keep transgender girls out of girls school sports, limiting which school bathrooms transgender people can use, requiring school staff to notify parents if their student identifies in school as transgender, and barring school staff from being required to use the pronouns a transgender student uses. Most of those policies have been challenged in court. Here's a look at the new regulation, the states' laws and what could happen next. The 1,577-page regulation finalized last week seeks to clarify Title IX, the 1972 sex discrimination law originally passed to address women's rights and applies to schools and colleges that receive federal money. The regulations, which are to take effect in August, spell out that Title IX bars discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, too. Many Republicans say this wasn't the intent of the law. The new rules also provide more protections to students who make accusations of sexual misconduct. At least 11 states have adopted laws barring transgender girls and women from using girls' and women's bathrooms at public schools. The new regulation opposes those sweeping policies. It states that sex separation at schools isn't always unlawful. However, the separation becomes a violation of Title IX's nondiscrimination rule when it causes more than a very minor harm on a protected individual, \u201csuch as when it denies a transgender student access to a sex-separate facility or activity consistent with that student\u2019s gender identity.\u201d The laws are in effect in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee. A judge\u2019s order putting enforcement on hold is in place in Idaho. A prohibition in Utah is scheduled to take effect July 1. At least seven states have laws or other policies calling for schools to notify parents if their children are transgender. The regulation seems to authorize those requirements, stating that \u201cnothing in these final regulations prevents a recipient from disclosing information about a minor child to their parent who has the legal right to receive disclosures on behalf of their child.\u201d The requirements are already law in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana and North Carolina. The Arizona law requires schools to provide information to parents but does not specifically include details about students' gender expression or sexuality. Virginia asked schools to provide guidance to the state's school districts to adopt similar policies, though they're not written into state law. At least four states \u2014 Florida, Kentucky, Montana and North Dakota \u2014 have laws intended to protect from discipline teachers and/or students who won't use the pronouns transgender or nonbinary students use. The regulations wrestle with this, finding that \u201charassing a student \u2014 including acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on the student\u2019s nonconformity with stereotypical notions of masculinity and femininity or gender identity \u2014 can constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX in certain circumstances.\u201d But they also spell out that \u201ca stray remark\u201d does not constitute harassment and seek to protect the right of free speech. The new rules don't specifically mention whether states can ban transgender girls from girls sports competitions. The Biden administration has put on hold a policy that would forbid schools from having outright bans. State laws that contain such bans have been adopted in at least two dozen states in the name of preserving girls sports. But judges have paused enforcement of some of them, including in a ruling last week that applies only to one teenage athlete in West Virginia. While the new rules are not specific to sports participation, advocates on both sides believe they could apply. \u201cThey may be saying that this doesn't address it, but through the broad language they\u2019re using, the ultimate result is you have to allow a boy on a girls team,\u201d said Matt Sharp, a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom, falsely identifying transgender girls as boys. Alliance Defending Freedom is a conservative group that has represented female athletes challenging sports participation by transgender women and girls. \u201cThis document gives a good sense that says you can\u2019t have a rule that says, \u2018If you\u2019re transgender, you can\u2019t participate,\u2019\u201d said Harper Seldin, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer. Lawsuits, probably. After the rules were unveiled last week, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti posted on X that \u201cTN is prepared to defend Title IX & protect against unlawful regulations that redefine what sex really means.\u201d \u201cWe absolutely plan to challenge this betrayal of women in court,\u201d Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said in a statement Monday. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond submitted comments critical of the rule before it was finalized. Over the last two decades, attorneys general have frequently sued the opposing party's president over rules and executive orders. Sharp of Alliance Defending Freedom said his group is still dissecting the federal rules but does represent groups that could be affected, including female athletes and religious schools and could sue over aspects of the rules. He expects states to do the same thing. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of states want to wait until the federal government enforces this,\u201d he said. The ACLU's Seldin said his organization will watch carefully how the rules play out. \u201cWhat do theses laws and regulations mean in terms of transgender youth and transgender students who find themselves attacked in every aspect of their lives?\u201d he asked. ___ Associated Press reporter Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Florida; Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee; and Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City contributed to this article.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 05:30:00",
            "content": "GENEVA -- The U.N. labor organization warned Monday that over 70% of the world's workforce is likely to be exposed to excessive heat during their careers, citing increased concern about exposure to sunlight. It also warned of air pollution, pesticides and other hazards that could lead to health problems including cancer. In a new report, the International Labor Organization suggested ways that governments can improve their legislation and help cope with the rising effects of climate change on workers. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that climate change is already creating significant additional health hazards for workers,\u201d said Manal Azzi, the organization's team lead on occupational safety and health. \u201cIt is essential that we heed these warnings.\" The ILO estimates that over 2.4 billion workers \u2014 more than 70% of the global workforce \u2014 are likely to face excessive heat as part of their jobs at some point, according to the most recent figures available, from 2020. That's up from over 65% in 2000. The Geneva-based body cited the growing link between climate change and harm to human health, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory troubles and mental health. It estimates, for example, that 1.6 billion workers are exposed to ultraviolet radiation as part of their jobs, citing nearly 19,000 deaths a year from non-melanoma skin cancer, and ailments as diverse as sunburn, skin blistering and eye damage, cataracts and retina trouble like macular degeneration. The same number of workers \u2014 1.6 billion \u2014 are exposed to workplace air pollution \u201cresulting in up to 860,000 work-related deaths among outdoor workers annually,\u201d it said in a statement. The report said some subsets of workers are particularly vulnerable, such as firefighters in the United States battling wildfires, which experts say have become bigger and more frequent because of climate change due to high heat and excessively dry conditions. \u201cWorkers are often forgotten when we\u2019re talking about climate change and the health impacts are very severe from death, to millions of sick people because of hazards exacerbated by climate change, but also millions living with chronic diseases,\" Aziz said. Some countries have taken action by enacting legislation that calls for regular surveillance of workers regularly exposed to heat, excess sunlight, air pollution and other health risks on the job. In other cases, ILO says collective bargaining agreements between labor and business leaders have helped mitigate the risks. U.N. agencies and environment al activists have increasingly sought to highlight the link between climate change and human health. Planet Earth tallied a 10th straight month of record monthly temperatures in March, according to the European Union's climate agency. The World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, just a handful of climate-related threats, such as malaria and water insecurity, will claim a quarter of a million additional lives each year.",

            "title": "The pandemic exposed staff shortages at nursing homes. A new White House push aims for a remedy",
            "date": "2024-04-22 05:02:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday said the first rule to set minimum staffing levels at federally funded nursing homes and require that a certain portion of the taxpayer dollars they receive go toward wages for care workers is a long-overdue \u201cmilestone\u201d that recognizes their value to society. Harris announced the rules in Washington before she flew to LaCrosse, Wisconsin to meet with nursing home care employees. In the battleground state, the Democratic vice president also held a campaign event focused on abortion rights. \u201cIt is about time that we start to recognize your value and pay you accordingly and give you the structure and support that you deserve,\u201d Harris told a small group of care workers. The federal government is for the first time requiring nursing homes to have minimum staffing levels after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed grim realities in poorly staffed facilities. The change will mean more staff at these facilities, fewer emergency room visits for residents and peace of mind for caregivers, who will be able to spend more time with their patients, Harris said. The vice president said that Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for lower-income people, pays $125 billion annually to home health care companies, which were not required to report on how they were spending the money. A second rule being finalized Monday will require that 80% of that money be used to pay workers, instead of administrative or overhead costs, Harris said. \u201cThis is about dignity, and it's about dignity that we as a society owe to those in particular who care for the least of these,\u201d she said. President Joe Biden first announced his plan to set nursing home staffing levels in his 2022 State of the Union address. Current law only requires that nursing homes have \u201csufficient\u201d staffing, leaving it up to states for interpretation. The new rules implement a minimum number of hours that staff members spend with residents. They also require a registered nurse to be available around the clock at federally funded facilities, which are home to about 1.2 million people. Allies of older adults have sought the regulation for decades, but the rules drew pushback from the nursing home industry. Mark Parkinson, president of the American Health Care Association, which lobbies for care facilities, said Monday in a statement that the organization was disappointed and troubled that the federal government was moving forward with what he said was an \u201cunfunded mandate.\u201d \u201cIt is unconscionable that the administration is finalizing this rule given our nation\u2019s changing demographics and growing caregiver shortage,\u201d Parkinson said. \u201cIssuing a final rule that demands hundreds of thousands of additional caregivers when there\u2019s a nationwide shortfall of nurses just creates an impossible task for providers.\u201d Wisconsin Republicans echoed the staffing concerns, noting shortages particularly in rural parts of the state. In Elroy, Wisconsin, for instance, an 80-bed nursing home would be required to hire six additional nurses, but \u201cwe simply don't have the bodies,\u201d said Wisconsin state Rep. Tony Kurtz. Noting the added costs and requirements, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson bluntly insisted to reporters on a conference call that the rule \u201cmight sound good. It won\u2019t work.\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said the change is about setting a standard for quality of care. \u201cWe believe, that with more and more Americans going to nursing homes, it's time to make sure that quality is the standard that everyone strives for,\u201d Becerra said in an interview. He said the administration listened to feedback from the nursing home industry and is allowing the rule to be phased in with longer timeframes for nursing homes in rural communities and temporary hardship exemptions in places where it's hard to find staff. The care event marked Harris' third visit to the battleground state this year and is part of Biden's push to earn the support of union workers in his bid for reelection. Republican presidential challenger Donald Trump made inroads with blue-collar workers in his 2016 victory. Biden regularly calls himself the \"most pro-union\u201d president in history and has received endorsements from leading labor groups such as the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Lisa Gordon, a certified nursing assistant who told Harris, \u201cI've been doing this job for 29 years,\u201d said she was grateful that Biden and the vice president were \u201cfinally getting something done.\u201d \u201cI entered this field because I care about taking care of our elderly,\u201d Gordon said during a talk with other care providers, Chiquita Brooks-Lasure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and April Verrett, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union. \u201cBeing short-staffed is not taking care of them like they should be,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThey didn't ask to be there. Your residents are your family. They're your loved ones. We need these changes.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic, which claimed more than 167,000 nursing home residents in the U.S., exposed the poor staffing levels at the facilities and led many workers to leave the industry. Advocates for the elderly and disabled reported residents who were neglected, going without meals and water or kept in soiled diapers for too long. Experts said staffing levels are the most important marker for quality of care. The new rules call for staffing equivalent to 3.48 hours per resident per day, just over half an hour of it coming from registered nurses. The government said that means a facility with 100 residents would need two or three registered nurses and 10 or 11 nurse aides as well as two additional nurse staff per shift to meet the new standards. The average U.S. nursing home already has overall caregiver staffing of about 3.6 hours per resident per day, including RN staffing just above the half-hour mark, but the government said a majority of the country\u2019s roughly 15,000 nursing homes would have to add staff under the new regulation. The new thresholds are still lower than those that had long been eyed by advocates after a landmark 2001 study funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommended an average of 4.1 hours of nursing care per resident daily. ___ Associated Press writer Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.",

            "content": "TALLINN, Estonia -- Nearly 100 political prisoners in Belarus, incarcerated in a severe crackdown on dissent, have severe medical problems and could be close to death, the country's respected human rights group Viasna said Monday. Viasna, whose Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder Ales Bialiatski is among those imprisoned in the crackdown, identified 93 prisoners of particular concern who are suffering from cancer, heart disease and other conditions that are being neglected or poorly treated behind bars. \u201cIn captivity, every disease progresses faster, in addition to the lack of qualified medical care,\" said Viasna representative Pavel Sapelka. \"This is influenced by the conditions of detention \u2014 lack of fresh air, poor nutrition, constant psychological pressure and stress.\u201d Belarus started a harsh crackdown on opposition after large protests arose across the country following August 2020 election s who disputed results gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko a sixth term in office. Human rights activists count some 35,000 people detained in the crackdown, many of whom were beaten by police. All significant opposition figures have been imprisoned or have fled the country. Viasna says more than 1,400 political prisoners are now behind bars. Among the cases cited by Viasna in the report is that of Maria Kolesnikova, who was one of the most prominent leaders of the post-election protests. She underwent abdominal surgery but was quickly transported back to prison. Viasna said her dietary needs are not being observed and said investigation found that she was beaten prior to being hospitalized. Other cases the group noted included 19-year-old Mikita Zalatarou, who reportedly is being denied pills to control his epilepsy, and Yauhen Barouski, who told his family while ill that \u201cI'm probably just going to die here.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-19 18:27:00",
            "content": "BOISE, Idaho -- A new Idaho organization says it will ask voters to restore abortion access and other reproductive health care rights in the state after lawmakers let a second legislative session end without modifying strict abortion bans that have been blamed for a recent exodus of health care providers. \u201cWe have not been able to get a fix from our lawmakers, our politicians. We are going to seek a fix from our people,\u201d Melanie Folwell, a spokeswoman for Idahoans United for Women and Families, said Friday morning. \u201cThe people in Idaho understand the contours of this problem.\u201d Idaho has several anti-abortion laws on the books, including one that makes performing abortions a crime even in medical emergencies unless they are done to save the life of the pregnant patient. The federal government has sued Idaho over the ban, contending it violates a federal law that requires hospitals to provide stabilizing care \u2014 including abortion \u2014 if a patient's life or health is at serious risk. Idaho's attorneys say the ban allows for life-saving procedures for things like ectopic pregnancies, and they contend the Biden administration is trying to create a federal \u201cabortion loophole\u201d at Idaho hospitals. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in that case on Wednesday. Idahoans United for Women and Families is fundraising and hopes to have one or more ballot initiatives ready to propose this summer in an effort to get them on the 2026 ballot, Folwell said. Across the country, there have been increased efforts to put abortion rights questions to voters since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and removed the nationwide right to abortion. Voters in seven states have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures, and several other states have signature drives for future ballot initiatives underway. Cynthia Dalsing, a certified nurse midwife in northern Idaho and a board member for Idahoans United for Women and Families, said her region went from offering a \u201cpremiere obstetric range of services\u201d to becoming a maternal care desert after the four local obstetricians moved out of state. Pregnant women in the state's panhandle now must either travel as much as 80 miles away or leave the state entirely for obstetric care, Dalsing said. Some are delivering babies at home because of a lack of other options, she said. Roughly one-quarter of Idaho obstetricians have stopped practicing since a near-total abortion ban took effect in August 2022, along with about half of the state's maternal fetal medicine doctors, according to data compiled by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative. Three hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units. Some physicians and businesses are warning that the abortion bans carry other ripple effects as well. During a news conference on Thursday, Dr. Jim Souza said the reduced access to prenatal health care means some dangerous pregnancy conditions will be diagnosed later than normal. Souza, the chief physician executive at the Boise-based St. Luke's Health System, said that could lead to increased need for intensive medical treatment for newborns or expensive medical interventions for mothers that could have been avoided with better access to obstetric care. A coalition of groups including the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, Levi Strauss & Co., Yelp, Lyft and Match Group Inc. which runs dating apps like Tinder filed a friend-of-the court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court case contending that the abortion bans make it harder to recruit and retain workers and lead to increased time off of work for those who have to travel elsewhere for care.",

            "title": "Biden sees a $35 price cap for insulin as a pivotal campaign issue. It\u2019s not that clear-cut",
            "date": "2024-04-21 07:41:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- Rarely a day goes without President Joe Biden mentioning insulin prices. He promotes a $35 price cap for the medication for Americans on Medicare \u2014 in White House speeches, campaign stops and even at non-health care events around the country. His reelection team has flooded swing-state airwaves with ads mentioning it, in English and Spanish. All that would seemingly add up to a sweeping political and economic impact. The reality is more complicated. As his campaign tries to emphasize what it sees as an advantage over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, Biden often overstates what those people who are eligible for the price cap once paid for insulin. It\u2019s also not clear whether the number of Americans being helped will be enough to help sway November\u2019s election , even in the most closely contested states that could come down to a few thousand votes. \u201cIt is about political signaling in a campaign much more than it is about demonstrating for people that they benefit from the insulin cap,\u201d said Drew Altman, president and CEO of KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. \u201cIt is a way to make concrete the fact that you are the health care candidate.\u201d Many who are benefiting from the price cap were already getting insulin at reduced prices, were already Biden supporters, or both. Others who need reduced-price insulin, meanwhile, cannot get it because they do not have Medicare or private health insurance . Biden\u2019s campaign is emphasizing the president's successful efforts to reduce insulin prices and contrasting that with Trump, who first ran for president promising to lower drug prices but took limited action in office. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful and tangible contrast,\u201d said Biden campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one we are campaigning on early, aggressively, and across our coalition.\u201d Roughly 8.4 million people in the United States control their blood sugar levels with insulin, and more than 1 million have Type 1 diabetes and could die without regular access to it. The White House says nearly 4 million older people qualify for the new, lower price. The price cap for Medicare recipients was part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which originally sought to cap insulin at $35 for all those with health insurance. When it passed in 2022, it was scaled back by congressional Republicans to apply only to older adults. The Biden administration has also announced agreements with drugmakers Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, to cap insulin co-payments at $35 for those with private insurance. They account for more than 90% of the U.S. insulin market. But Biden says constantly that many people used to pay up to $400 monthly, which is an overstatement. A Department of Health and Human Services study released in December 2022 found that people with diabetes who were enrolled in Medicare or had private insurance paid an average of $452 annually, not monthly. The high prices the president cites mostly affected people without health insurance. But the rates of the uninsured have fallen to record lows because of the Obama administration\u2019s signature health care law and the Biden White House\u2019s aggressive efforts to ensure those eligible to enroll are doing so more frequently. So, in effect, one of the administration\u2019s policy initiatives is undermining the economic argument for another. That effort has not reached everyone, though. Yanet Martinez who lives in Phoenix and supports Biden. She does not work or have health insurance, but gets insulin for around $16 per month thanks to steep discounts at her local clinic. The lower prices only apply if her husband, a landscaper, does not make enough to exceed the monthly income limit. If he does, her insulin can jump to $500-plus, she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people talk about the price of insulin going down. I\u2019ve not seen it,\u201d said Martinez, 42. \u201cIt should be uniform. There are a lot of people who don\u2019t have any way to afford it and it makes things very difficult.\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., is sponsoring bipartisan legislation to make the $35 insulin cap universal, even for people without health insurance. In the meantime, he said, what's been accomplished with Medicare recipients and drugmakers agreeing to reduce their prices is \"literally saving lives and saving people money.\u201d \u201cThis is good policy because it centers the people rather than the politics,\" Warnock said. He said that as he travels Georgia, a pivotal swing state in November, people say \u201cthank you for doing this for me, or for someone in my family.\u201d That includes people like Tommy Marshall, a 56-year-old financial services consultant in Atlanta, who has health insurance. He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 45 and injects fast-acting insulin several times daily. He paid about $250 for four weeks to eight weeks worth of medication last November, but saw the price fall by half in February, after Novo Nordisk agreed to cut prices. \u201cIf I was his political consultant, I\u2019d be telling (Biden) to talk about it constantly,\" said Marshall, a lifelong Democrat and longtime public advocate for cutting insulin prices, including for the advocacy group Protect Our Care Georgia. Marshall said the price caps \u201chave meaningful emotional resonance\u201d and could sway a close election but also conceded, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 18- to 65-year-olds. I can just imagine there\u2019s probably two or three other issues that are in front of this one.\u201d \u201cMaybe someone sort of on-the-fence, he added \u201cthis could maybe sway them.\u201d Geoff Garin, a pollster for Biden's reelection campaign, said the insulin cap is one of the president's highest performing issues. He said the data was \u201cclear, consistent and overwhelming.\u201d Rich Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which has endorsed Biden, called the insulin cap a strong issue for the president among older voters. \u201cFor the persuadables \u2014 and there are some still out there, believe it or not \u2014 drug costs are a very important factor,\u201d said Fiesta, whose group has 4.4-million members and advocates for health and economic security for older people. Trump's campaign did not respond to questions. But Theo Merkel, senior fellow at the conservative Paragon Health Institute, countered that the insulin price cut an example of \"policies written to fit the talking points other than the other way around.\u201d Merkel, who was a Trump White House adviser on health policy, said manufacturers that have long made insulin prefer caps on how much the insured pay because it gives them more leverage to secure higher prices from insurance companies. The president's approval ratings on health care are among his highest on a range of issues, but still only 42% of U.S. adults approve of Biden\u2019s handling of health care while 55% disapprove, according to a February poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. KFF found in its own poll in December that that 59% of U.S. adults trust the Democratic Party to do a better job addressing health care affordability issues compared to 39% for Republicans, even if only 26% of respondents in the same poll said they knew about the insulin price cap. \u201cIn political terms, the Democrats and Biden have an advantage on health care,\" Altman said. \u201cThey're pressing it.\u201d",

            "title": "Kansas has a new anti-DEI law, but the governor has vetoed bills on abortion and even police dogs",
            "date": "2024-04-19 17:47:00",
            "content": "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas' Democratic governor on Friday vetoed proposed tax breaks for anti-abortion counseling centers while allowing restrictions on college diversity initiatives approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature to become law without her signature. Gov. Laura Kelly also vetoed a bill with bipartisan support to increase the penalties for killing a law enforcement dog or horse, a move that the GOP leader who pushed it called \u201cpolitical pettiness.\u201d In addition, she rejected two election s measures fueled at least in part by the influence of people promoting baseless election conspiracies among Republicans. Kelly's action on the bill dealing with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives stood out because it broke with her vetoes last year of anti-DEI measure from the current state budget. The new law, taking effect July 1, prohibits state universities, community colleges and technical schools from requiring prospective students or applicants for jobs or promotions to make statements on their views about diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Kelly let it become law only two days after the state's higher education board adopted its own, narrower ban on the same practices. \u201cWhile I have concerns about this legislation, I don\u2019t believe that the conduct targeted in this legislation occurs in our universities,\" Kelly said in her message on the bill, contradicting statements made by GOP legislators. Legislators are scheduled to return Thursday from a spring break and wrap up their work for the year in six days. Top Republicans immediately pledged to try to override Friday\u2019s vetoes. Republicans in about two dozen states have sought to limit DEI initiatives, arguing that they are discriminatory and enforce a liberal political orthodoxy. Alabama and Utah enacted new anti-DEI laws this year, and a ban enacted in Texas last year has led to more than 100 job cuts on University of Texas campuses. The new policy from the Kansas Board of Regents applies only to state universities and does not specify any penalties, while the new law will allow a fine of up to $10,000 for each violation. Backers of DEI programs say they are being misrepresented. The American Psychological Association defines diversity, equity and inclusion as a framework to guide \u201cfair treatment and full participation of all people,\u201d especially those in minority groups. \u201cWe need to move forward and focus our efforts on making college more affordable and providing students from all backgrounds with the tools they need to succeed,\u201d Kelly said in her message on the bill. With the bill helping the state's nearly 60 anti-abortion centers, Kelly's veto was expected because she is a strong supporter of abortion rights. She already has vetoed two other measures championed by abortion opponents this year. But GOP lawmakers in Kansas have had increasing success in overriding Kelly\u2019s actions. Republican leaders appear to have the two-thirds majorities necessary in both chambers on abortion issues and appeared close on the DEI bill. The latest abortion measure would exempt anti-abortion centers that provide free services to prospective mothers and new parents from paying the state's 6.5% sales tax on what they buy and give donors to them income tax credits totaling up to $10 million a year. Kelly said in her veto message that it is not appropriate for the state to \u201cdivert taxpayer dollars to largely unregulated crisis pregnancy centers.\u201d The bill also includes provisions designed to financially help parents who adopt or want to adopt children. \u201cGovernor Kelly has shown once again that her only allegiance is to the profit-driven abortion industry, and not to vulnerable Kansas women, children, and families,\u201d Jeanne Gawdun, a lobbyist for Kansans for Life, the state's most influential anti-abortion group, said in a statement. Abortion opponents in Kansas are blocked from pursuing the same kind of severe restrictions or bans on abortion imposed in neighboring states, including Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. A Kansas Supreme Court decision in 2019 declared that access to abortion is a fundamental right under the state constitution, and a statewide vote in August 2022 decisively affirmed that position. \u201cThis bill goes against the wishes of Kansans,\u201d Kelly said in her veto message. Kelly also has clashed repeatedly with Republicans on voting rights issues. One of the elections bills she vetoed would require county election officials to track how many ballots an individual delivers for other voters, as the state limits the delivery of 10 ballots per person. Legislators set that limit in 2021, but many Republicans argue that the state hasn't been able to adequately enforce it. GOP lawmakers contend the limit prevents fraud and lost ballots, though there was no evidence of such problems. The other elections bill would prohibit state agencies and local officials from using federal funds in administering elections or promoting voting without the Legislature's express permission. Republicans see spending by the Biden administration as an attempt to improperly boost Democratic turnout. But Kelly chided lawmakers for \u201cfocusing on problems that do not exist.\" \u201cI would urge the Legislature to focus on real issues impacting Kansans,\u201d Kelly said in her veto message on the second bill. The veto of the bill on police dogs was perhaps Kelly's most surprising action. Increased penalties have had bipartisan support across the U.S., and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis this week signed a measure this week. The Kansas measure was inspired by the November death of Bane, an 8-year-old Wichita police dog, who authorities say was strangled by a suspect in a domestic violence case. It would allow a first-time offender to be sentenced to up to five years and fined up to $10,000. Kelly said the issue needed more study, saying the new penalties for killing a police dog would be out of line with other, more severe crimes, \u201cwithout justification.\" But House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican and the bill's biggest champion, said: \u201cThis veto is a slap in the face of all law enforcement.\u201d ___ This story has been corrected to show that one of the elections bills vetoed by Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly would require county election officials to track how many ballots an individual delivers for other voters, as the state limits the delivery of 10 ballots per person. It does not eliminate the extra three days a voter has after Election Day to return a mail ballot.",

            "title": "Toxic: How the search for the origins of COVID-19 turned politically poisonous",
            "date": "2024-04-22 02:36:00",
            "content": "BEIJING -- The hunt for the origins of COVID-19 has gone dark in China , the victim of political infighting after a series of stalled and thwarted attempts to find the source of the virus that killed millions and paralyzed the world for months. The Chinese government froze meaningful domestic and international efforts to trace the virus from the first weeks of the outbreak, despite statements supporting open scientific inquiry, an Associated Press investigation found. That pattern continues to this day, with labs closed, collaborations shattered, foreign scientists forced out and Chinese researchers barred from leaving the country. The investigation drew on thousands of pages of undisclosed emails and documents and dozens of interviews that showed the freeze began far earlier than previously known and involved political and scientific infighting in China as much as international finger-pointing. As early as Jan. 6, 2020, health officials in Beijing closed the lab of a Chinese scientist who sequenced the virus and barred researchers from working with him. Scientists warn the willful blindness over coronavirus \u2019 origins leaves the world vulnerable to another outbreak, potentially undermining pandemic treaty talks coordinated by the World Health Organization set to culminate in May. At the heart of the question is whether the virus jumped from an animal or came from a laboratory accident. A U.S. intelligence analysis says there is insufficient evidence to prove either theory, but the debate has further tainted relations between the U.S. and China. Unlike in the U.S., there is virtually no public debate in China about whether the virus came from nature or from a lab leak. In fact, there is little public discussion at all about the source of the disease, first detected in the central city of Wuhan. Crucial initial efforts were hampered by bureaucrats in Wuhan trying to avoid blame who misled the central government; the central government, which muzzled Chinese scientists and subjected visiting WHO officials to stage-managed tours; and the U.N. health agency itself, which may have compromised early opportunities to gather critical information in hopes that by placating China, scientists could gain more access, according to internal materials obtained by AP. In a faxed statement, China's Foreign Ministry defended China\u2019s handling of research into the origins, saying the country is open and transparent, shared data and research, and \u201cmade the greatest contribution to global origins research.\u201d The National Health Commission, China's top medical authority, said the country \u201cinvested huge manpower, material and financial resources\u201d and \u201chas not stopped looking for the origins of the coronavirus.\u201d It could have played out differently, as shown by the outbreak of SARS, a genetic relative of COVID-19, nearly 20 years ago. China initially hid infections then, but WHO complained swiftly and publicly. Ultimately, Beijing fired officials and made reforms. The U.N. agency soon found SARS likely jumped to humans from civet cats in southern China and international scientists later collaborated with their Chinese counterparts to pin down bats as SARS\u2019 natural reservoir. But different leaders of both China and WHO, China\u2019s quest for control of its researchers, and global tensions have all led to silence when it comes to searching for COVID-19\u2019s origins. Governments in Asia are pressuring scientists not to look for the virus for fear it could be traced inside their borders. Even without those complications, experts say identifying how outbreaks begin is incredibly challenging and that it\u2019s rare to know with certainty how some viruses begin spreading. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing how quickly the search for the origins of (COVID-19) escalated into politics,\u201d said Mark Woolhouse, a University of Edinburgh outbreak expert. \u201cNow this question may never be definitively answered.\u201d Secrecy clouds the beginning of the outbreak. Even the date when Chinese authorities first started searching for the origins is unclear. The first publicly known search for the virus took place on Dec. 31, 2019, when Chinese Center for Disease Control scientists visited the Wuhan market where many early COVID-19 cases surfaced. However, WHO officials heard of an earlier inspection of the market on Dec. 25, 2019, according to a recording of a confidential WHO meeting provided to AP by an attendee. Such a probe has never been mentioned publicly by either Chinese authorities or WHO. In the recording, WHO\u2019s top animal virus expert, Peter Ben Embarek, mentioned the earlier date, describing it as \u201can interesting detail.\u201d He told colleagues that officials were \u201clooking at what was on sale in the market, whether all the vendors have licenses (and) if there was any illegal (wildlife) trade happening in the market.\u201d A colleague asked Ben Embarek, who is no longer with WHO, if that seemed unusual. He responded that \u201cit was not routine,\u201d and that the Chinese \u201cmust have had some reason\u201d to investigate the market. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to figure out what happened and why they did that.\u201d Ben Embarek declined to comment. Another WHO staffer at the Geneva meeting in late January 2020 confirmed Ben Embarek\u2019s comments. The Associated Press could not confirm the search independently. It remains a mystery if it took place, what inspectors discovered, or whether they sampled live animals that might point to how COVID-19 emerged. A Dec. 25, 2019, inspection would have come when Wuhan authorities were aware of the mysterious disease. The day before, a local doctor sent a sample from an ill market vendor to get sequenced that turned out to contain COVID-19. Chatter about the unknown pneumonia was spreading in Wuhan\u2019s medical circles, according to one doctor and a relative of another who declined to be identified, fearing repercussions. A scientist in China when the outbreak occurred said they heard of a Dec. 25 inspection from collaborating virologists in the country. They declined to be named out of fear of retribution. WHO said in an email that it was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the Dec. 25 investigation. It is not included in the U.N. health agency\u2019s official COVID-19 timeline. When China CDC researchers from Beijing arrived on Jan. 1 to collect samples at the market, it had been ordered shut and was already being disinfected, destroying critical information about the virus. Gao Fu, then head of the China CDC, mentioned it to an American collaborator. \u201cHis complaint when I met him was that all the animals were gone,\u201d said Columbia University epidemiologist Ian Lipkin. Robert Garry, who studies viruses at Tulane University, said a Dec. 25 probe would be \u201chugely significant,\u201d given what is known about the virus and its spread. \u201cBeing able to swab it directly from the animal itself would be pretty convincing and nobody would be arguing\u201d about the origins of COVID-19, he said. But perhaps local officials simply feared for their jobs, with memories of firings after the 2003 SARS outbreak still vivid, said Ray Yip, the founding head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outpost in China. \u201cThey were trying to save their skin, hide the evidence,\u201d Yip said. The Wuhan government did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Another early victim was Zhang Yongzhen, the first scientist to publish a sequence of the virus. A day after he wrote a memo urging health authorities to action, China\u2019s top health official ordered Zhang\u2019s lab closed. \u201cThey used their official power against me and our colleagues,\u201d Zhang wrote in an email provided to AP by Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist. On Jan. 20, 2020, a WHO delegation arrived in Wuhan for a two-day mission. China did not approve a visit to the market, but they stopped by a China CDC lab to examine infection prevention and control\u202fprocedures, according to an internal WHO travel report. WHO\u2019s then-China representative, Dr. Gauden Galea, told colleagues in a private meeting that inquiries about COVID-19\u2019s origins went unanswered. By then, many Chinese were angry at their government. Among Chinese doctors and scientists, the sense grew that Beijing was hunting for someone to blame. \u201cThere are a few cadres who have performed poorly,\u201d Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in unusually harsh comments in February. \u201cSome dare not take responsibility, wait timidly for orders from above, and don\u2019t move without being pushed.\u201d The government opened investigations into top health officials, according to two former and current China CDC staff and three others familiar with the matter. Health officials were encouraged to report colleagues who mishandled the outbreak to Communist Party disciplinary bodies, according to two of the people. Some people both inside and outside China speculated about a laboratory leak. Those suspicious included right-wing American politicians, but also researchers close to WHO. The focus turned to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a high-level lab that experimented with some of the world\u2019s most dangerous viruses. In early February 2020, some of the West\u2019s leading scientists, headed by Dr. Jeremy Farrar, then at Britain\u2019s Wellcome Trust, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, then director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, banded together to assess the origins of the virus in calls, a Slack channel and emails. They drafted a paper suggesting a natural evolution, but even among themselves, they could not agree on the likeliest scenario. Some were alarmed by features they thought might indicate tinkering. \u201cThere have (been) suggestions that the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab,\u201d Holmes, the Australian virologist, who believed the virus originated in nature, wrote in a Feb. 7, 2020, email. \u201cI do a lot of work in China, and I can (assure) you that a lot of people there believe they are being lied to.\u201d American scientists close to researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology warned counterparts there to prepare. James LeDuc, head of a Texas lab, emailed his Wuhan colleague on Feb. 9, 2020, saying he\u2019d already been approached by U.S. officials. \u201cClearly addressing this will be essential, with any kind of documentation you might have,\u201d he wrote. The Chinese government was conducting its own secret investigation into the Wuhan Institute. Gao, the then-head of the China CDC, and another Chinese health expert revealed its existence in interviews months and years later. Both said the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing, which Holmes, the Australian virologist, also heard from another contact in China. But Gao said even he hadn't seen further details, and some experts suspect they may never be released. WHO started negotiations with China for a further visit with the virus origins in mind, but it was China\u2019s Foreign Ministry that decided the terms. Scientists were sidelined and politicians took control. China refused a visa for Ben Embarek, then WHO\u2019s top animal virus expert. The itinerary dropped nearly all items linked to an origins search, according to draft agendas for the trip obtained by the AP. And Gao, the then-head of the China CDC who is also a respected scientist tasked with investigating the origins, was left off the schedule. Instead, Liang Wannian, a politician in the Communist Party hierarchy, took charge of the international delegation. Liang is an epidemiologist close to top Chinese officials and China's Foreign Ministry who is widely seen as pushing the party line, not science-backed policies, according to nine people familiar with the situation who declined to be identified to speak on a sensitive subject. Liang ruled in favor of shutting the Wuhan market at the beginning of the outbreak, according to a Chinese media interview with a top China CDC official that was later deleted. Significantly, it was Liang who promoted an implausible theory that the virus came from contaminated frozen food imported into China. Liang did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Most of the WHO delegation was not allowed to go to Wuhan, which was under lockdown. The few who did learned little. They again had no access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology or the wildlife market and obtained only scant details about China CDC efforts to trace the coronavirus there. On the train, Liang lobbied the visiting WHO scientists to praise China\u2019s health response in their public report. Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saw it as the \u201cbest way to meet China\u2019s need for a strong assessment of its response.\u201d The new section was so flattering that colleagues emailed Aylward to suggest he \u201cdial it back a bit.\u201d \u201cIt is remarkable how much knowledge about a new virus has been gained in such a short time,\u201d read the final report, which was reviewed by China\u2019s top health official before it went to Tedros. As criticism of China grew, the Chinese government deflected blame. Instead of firing health officials, they declared their virus response a success and closed investigations into the officials with few job losses. \u201cThere were no real reforms, because doing reforms means admitting fault,\u201d said a public health expert in contact with Chinese health officials who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. In late February 2020, the internationally respected doctor Zhong Nanshan appeared at a news conference and said that \u201cthe epidemic first appeared in China, but it did not necessarily originate in China.\u201d Days later, Chinese leader Xi ordered new controls on virus research. A leaked directive from China\u2019s Publicity Department ordered media not to report on the virus origins without permission, and a public WeChat account reposted an essay claiming the U.S. military created COVID-19 at a Fort Detrick lab and spread it to China during a 2019 athletic competition in Wuhan. Days later, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson repeated the accusation. The false claims enraged U.S. President Donald Trump, who began publicly blaming China for the outbreak, calling COVID-19 \u201cthe China virus\u201d and the \u201ckung-flu.\u201d Chinese officials told WHO that blood tests on lab workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were negative, suggesting COVID-19 wasn\u2019t the result of a lab accident there. But when WHO pressed for an independent audit, Chinese officials balked and demanded WHO investigate the U.S. and other countries as well. By blaming the U.S., Beijing diverted blame. It was effective in China, where many Chinese were upset by racially charged criticism. But outside China, it fueled speculation of a lab leak coverup. By the time WHO led another visit to Wuhan in January 2021, a year into the pandemic, the atmosphere was toxic. Liang, the Chinese health official in charge of two earlier WHO visits, continued to promote the questionable theory that the virus was shipped into China on frozen food. He suppressed information suggesting it could have come from animals at the Wuhan market, organizing market workers to tell WHO experts no live wildlife was sold and cutting recent photos of wildlife at the market from the final report. There was heavy political scrutiny, with numerous Chinese officials who weren\u2019t scientists or health officers present at meetings. Despite a lack of direct access, the WHO team concluded that a lab leak was \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d So it was infuriating to Chinese officials when WHO chief Tedros said it was \u201cpremature\u201d to rule out the lab leak theory, saying such lab accidents were \u201ccommon,\u201d and pressed China to be more transparent. China told WHO any future missions to find COVID-19 origins should be elsewhere, according to a letter obtained by AP. Since then, global cooperation on the issue has ground to a halt; an independent group convened by WHO to investigate the origins of COVID-19 in 2021 has been stymied by the lack of cooperation from China and other issues. Chinese scientists are still under heavy pressure, according to 10 researchers and health\u202fofficials. Researchers who published papers on the coronavirus ran into trouble with Chinese authorities. Others were barred from travel abroad for conferences and WHO meetings. Gao, the then-director of the China CDC, was investigated after U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a review of COVID-19 data, and again after giving interviews on the virus origins. New evidence is treated with suspicion. In March 2023, scientists announced that genetic material collected from the market showed raccoon dog DNA mixed with COVID-19 in early 2020, data that WHO said should have been publicly shared years before. The findings were posted, then removed by Chinese researchers with little explanation. The head of the China CDC Institute of Viral Disease was forced to retire over the release of the market data, according to a former China CDC official who declined to be named to speak on a sensitive topic. \u201cIt has to do with the origins, so they\u2019re still worried,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIf you try and get to the bottom of it, what if it turns out to be from China?\u201d Other scientists note that any animal from which the virus may have originally jumped has long since disappeared. \u201cThere was a chance for China to cooperate with WHO and do some animal sampling studies that might have answered the question,\u201d said Tulane University\u2019s Garry. \u201cThe trail to find the source has now gone cold.\u201d ___ Cheng reported from Geneva.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 02:51:00",
            "content": "BEIJING -- The Chinese government froze meaningful efforts to trace the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, despite publicly declaring it supported an open scientific inquiry, an Associated Press investigation has found. The AP drew on thousands of pages of undisclosed emails and documents, leaked recordings, and dozens of interviews that showed the freeze began far earlier than previously known \u2014 in the first weeks of the outbreak \u2014 and involved political and scientific infighting in China as much as international finger-pointing. Crucial initial efforts were hindered by bureaucrats in Wuhan trying to avoid blame who misled the central government; the central government, which silenced Chinese scientists and subjected visiting U.N. officials to stage-managed tours; and the World Health Organization itself, which may have compromised early opportunities to gather critical information, according to internal materials obtained by AP. Secrecy clouds the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Even the date when Chinese authorities first started searching for the virus\u2019 origins is unclear. The first publicly known search for the coronavirus took place on Dec. 31, 2019, when Chinese Center for Disease Control scientists visited the Wuhan market where many early COVID-19 cases surfaced. But WHO officials heard of an earlier inspection of the market on Dec. 25, 2019, according to a recording of a confidential WHO meeting provided to the AP. In the recording, WHO\u2019s top virus expert, Peter Ben Embarek, told colleagues that Chinese officials that day were \u201clooking at what was on sale in the market, whether all the vendors have licenses (and) if there was any illegal (wildlife) trade.\u201d Ben Embarek said the probe was \u201cnot routine\u201d and WHO would \u201ctry to figure out what happened.\u201d Such a probe has never been publicly mentioned by Chinese authorities or WHO. WHO said in an email that it was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any investigation on Dec. 25, 2019. Other experts said any visit to the market that day would be significant, especially if animal samples were taken because they could be critical evidence of how COVID-19 jumped to humans. Zhang Yongzhen was the first scientist to publish a sequence of the COVID-19 virus. One day after he wrote a memo urging health authorities to act quickly, China\u2019s top health official ordered his lab closed. \u201cThey used their official power against me and our colleagues,\u201d Zhang wrote in an email provided to AP by Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist.

            "date": "2024-04-21 11:39:00",
            "content": "CHEROKEE, N.C. -- Medical marijuana can now be legally purchased in North Carolina with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians opening its long-planned dispensary this weekend on tribal land. Hundreds of people, many with approved medical patient cards to purchase items, celebrated the historic opening of the Great Smoky Cannabis Co. on Saturday within the Eastern Band land known as the Qualla Boundary, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported. Saturday was April 20, which is also known as \u201c420 Day,\u201d or an annual day for the celebration of marijuana. The ceremony marks the latest liberalization of marijuana rules by the tribe, which in 2021 decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana within its 89 square miles (231 square kilometers) of land in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The tribe also formed a medical marijuana system that included a tribe-created business to grow cannabis and sell it, reaping financial rewards for the tribal members and assisting those with medical conditions. \u201cThis project will change the trajectory of their lives forever,\u201d Forrest Parker, general manager for Qualla Enterprises, the tribal company that manages the dispensary, said during the opening ceremony. \u201cIt will be a conduit to generations of social, economic and spiritual growth, unlike anything that\u2019s ever been witnessed.\u201d The Eastern Band, with about 14,000 members, can pass rules permitting cannabis as a sovereign nation and federally recognized tribe. Marijuana use remains illegal in the rest of North Carolina. Still, Republican U.S. Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd have raised concerns with federal and state law enforcement about whether drug laws will continue to be carried out in light of the dispensary. A statewide medical marijuana bill has been considered in recent years by the North Carolina General Assembly. Adults at least 21 years of age with a tribe medical cannabis patient card or an out-of-state approved medical marijuana card can purchase items at Great Smoky Cannabis Co. The scope of marijuana sales could become much greater. A majority of Eastern Band voters backed in a referendum last September the adult, recreational use of marijuana on tribal land. The question also asked whether voters supported the tribal council to develop legislation to regulate such a market. The Charlotte Observer reported that an adult use ordinance could be finalized in June, citing council member Boyd Owle. \u201cLet\u2019s get it right before we put it out there. But we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d Owle said after a council work session on the ordinance earlier this month. The dispensary could generate over $200 million in gross sales revenues in its first year if limited to medical patients, compared with $385 million if the product is available to all adult users, according to figures from Qualla Enterprises released before last year\u2019s adult-use referendum. Saturday\u2019s ceremony featured tribal translator Myrtle Driver Johnson purchasing the first medical marijuana in a transaction made in English and Cherokee. She said that she had named and translated the different strains of cannabis into Cherokee.",

            "title": "Morning sickness? Prenatal check-ups? What to know about new rights for pregnant workers",
            "date": "2024-04-20 09:04:00",
            "content": "Pregnant employees have the right to a wide range of accommodations under new federal regulations for enforcing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that supporters say could change workplace culture for millions of people. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency in charge of enforcing the law, adopted an expansive view of conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth in its proposed regulations, including a controversial decision to include abortion, fertility treatment and birth control as medical issues requiring job protections. The rules, which were adopted on a 3-2 vote along partisan lines, were published Monday and offer extensive guidelines for addressing more routine difficulties of pregnancy, such as morning sickness, back pain and needing to avoid heavy lifting. Labor advocates say the law will be especially transformative for pregnant women in low-wage jobs, who are often denied simple requests like more bathroom breaks. Here's what to know about the law and the EEOC regulations. Congress passed the law with bipartisan support in December 2022 following a decade-long campaign by women's rights and labor advocates, who argued that the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act did little to guarantee women would receive the accommodations they might need at work. The law stated only that pregnant workers should be treated the same as other employees, not that they deserved special consideration. To get their requests met, many pregnant workers therefore needed to demonstrate they had physical limitations covered under the Americans With Disabilities Act, often creating insurmountable hurdles. The new law treats pregnancy and related conditions as themselves deserving of \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d and places the burden on employers to prove \u201cundue hardships\u201d for denying any requests. The law applies to employers of at least 15 workers. The EEOC estimates it will cover roughly 1.5 million pregnant workers in any given year. The EEOC regulations published April 15 are set to go into effect in June. The EEOC's 400-page document encompasses a wide array of conditions and relevant advice for employers. It states that workers are entitled to unpaid time off for situations such as prenatal appointments, fertility treatments, abortion, miscarriage, postpartum depression and mastitis, an infection that arises from breastfeeding. This includes workers who are not covered by federal family leave laws and those who have not been on the job long enough to accrue time off. Workers can ask for flexible working arrangements to deal with morning sickness, such as a later start time, clearance to work from home or permission to carry snacks in workplaces where eating is typically prohibited. If they can't sit or stand for extended periods due to sciatica, which is common in late pregnancy, they can request a schedule adjustment so their commutes happen during less crowded hours. The regulations also allow workers to be exempted from tasks such as climbing ladders or heavy lifting. If those duties are essential to their jobs, they can still request a temporary dispensation, according to the EEOC. Employers don\u2019t have to accommodate workers exactly as requested but they must offer reasonable alternatives. They cannot deny a request without clearing a high bar to prove doing so would cause \u201cundue hardships\u201d for the organization\u2019s finances or operations. They cannot force workers to take unpaid leave if a reasonable accommodation is available. The EEOC emphasizes that it \u201cshould not be complicated or difficult\u201d for pregnant workers to request accommodations. Workers don't have to make requests in writing, use specific words, cite any laws, or in most cases, provide documentation such as doctors' notes. Employers must respond quickly and have a conversation about how to reasonably accommodate a worker\u2019s needs. Still, legal experts advise both workers and employers to document the process. A Better Balance, the non-profit that spearheaded the 10-year campaign for the law's passage, advises workers to familiarize themselves with their legal rights and be as specific as possible about their limitations and the changes they they need. Workers who believe a request was denied illegally can file a complaint with the EEOC. They have 180 days to do so, though the deadline can be extended in some states. The EEOC included abortion among the conditions covered under the law. The rules state, however, that employers are not obligated to cover expenses related to the procedure or to offer health insurance that does. The EEOC regulations argue that including abortion is consistent with the agency's longstanding interpretation of other laws under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. But the decision drew condemnation from Republican lawmakers who had championed the law's passage. The five-member EEOC's two Republican members voted against the regulations. In a statement explaining her dissent, Commissioner Andrea Lucas said the agency broadened the scope of the law \u201cto reach virtually every condition, circumstance, or procedure that relates to any aspect of the female reproductive system\" in ways that \"cannot reasonably be reconciled with the text\" of the law. Melissa Losch, a labor and employment attorney at the New Orleans-based firm McGlinchey Stafford, said she expects the regulations to give rise to further litigation. Losch cited the example of a worker living in a state with a restrictive abortion law requesting time off to undergo the procedure in another state. The EEOC rules provide \u201cno good answer\u201d about whether granting such a request would conflict with restrictive state abortion laws, she added. On February 27, a federal judge blocked enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act for Texas state employees, a ruling that came in response to a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxton argued the law was unconstitutional because it was part of a spending bill that passed in the House without a majority of members present, and the judge ruled in his favor. Gedmark, of A Better Balance, said she was optimistic the Biden administration would prevail in its expected appeal of the ruling. In the meantime, federal and private sectors workers in Texas are covered by the law. But in her dissenting statement, Lucas warned that if the Texas case or any future lawsuits succeed in overturning the law, the EEOC's divisive rules have \u201call but extinguished\u201d the chances of a bipartisan effort to reenact it. Employers have been obligated to abide by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act since it took effect on June 27, 2023, though the EEOC regulations provided guidance on how to do so. The law swiftly made a difference to many low-wage workers, according to Gedmark. A Better Balance, which operates a helpline, has \u201cheard an overwhelmingly positive experience from workers,\u201d she said. Last summer, the organization worked with some women whose employers stopped resisting requests for accommodations as soon as the law took effect, Gedmark said. Some workers reported their employers were still operating under the old legal framework, handing them pages of disability paperwork to fill out in response to requests. The EEOC said it received almost 200 complaints alleging violations of the law by the time the fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, 2023. Gedmark said the success of the law will depend on enforcement and raising awareness. \u201cIf workers don\u2019t know about the law and don\u2019t know about their rights, then it really undermines the purpose of the law,\u201d she said. ____ The Associated Press\u2019 women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

            "date": "2024-04-19 00:01:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- One woman miscarried in the lobby restroom of a Texas emergency room as front desk staff refused to check her in. Another woman learned that her fetus had no heartbeat at a Florida hospital, the day after a security guard turned her away from the facility. And in North Carolina, a woman gave birth in a car after an emergency room couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died. Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, federal documents obtained by The Associated Press reveal. The cases raise alarms about the state of emergency pregnancy care in the U.S., especially in states that enacted strict abortion laws and sparked confusion around the treatment doctors can provide. \u201cIt is shocking, it\u2019s absolutely shocking,\u201d said Amelia Huntsberger, an OB/GYN in Oregon. \u201cIt is appalling that someone would show up to an emergency room and not receive care -- this is inconceivable.\u201d It's happened despite federal mandates that the women be treated. Federal law requires emergency rooms to treat or stabilize patients who are in active labor and provide a medical transfer to another hospital if they don\u2019t have the staff or resources to treat them. Medical facilities must comply with the law if they accept Medicare funding. The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday that could weaken those protections. The Biden administration has sued Idaho over its abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, arguing it conflicts with the federal law. \u201cNo woman should be denied the care she needs,\u201d Jennifer Klein, director of the White House Gender Policy Council, said in a statement. \u201cAll patients, including women who are experiencing pregnancy-related emergencies, should have access to emergency medical care required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).\u201d Pregnant patients have \u201cbecome radioactive to emergency departments\u201d in states with extreme abortion restrictions, said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor. \u201cThey are so scared of a pregnant patient, that the emergency medicine staff won\u2019t even look. They just want these people gone,\" Rosenbaum said. Consider what happened to a woman who was nine months pregnant and having contractions when she arrived at the Falls Community Hospital in Marlin, Texas, in July 2022, a week after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on abortion. The doctor on duty refused to see her. \u201cThe physician came to the triage desk and told the patient that we did not have obstetric services or capabilities,\u201d hospital staff told federal investigators during interviews, according to documents. \u201cThe nursing staff informed the physician that we could test her for the presence of amniotic fluid. However, the physician adamantly recommended the patient drive to a Waco hospital.\u201d Investigators with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services concluded Falls Community Hospital broke the law. Reached by phone, an administrator at the hospital declined to comment on the incident. The investigation was one of dozens the AP obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request filed in February 2023 that sought all pregnancy-related EMTALA complaints the previous year. One year after submitting the request, the federal government agreed to release only some complaints and investigative documents filed across just 19 states. The names of patients, doctors and medical staff were redacted from the documents. Federal investigators looked into just over a dozen pregnancy-related complaints in those states during the months leading up to the U.S. Supreme Court's pivotal ruling on abortion in 2022. But more than two dozen complaints about emergency pregnancy care were lodged in the months after the decision was unveiled. It is not known how many complaints were filed last year as the records request only asked for 2022 complaints and the information is not publicly available otherwise. The documents did not detail what happened to the patient turned away from the Falls Community Hospital. Other pregnancies ended in catastrophe, the documents show. At Sacred Heart Emergency Center in Houston, front desk staff refused to check in one woman after her husband asked for help delivering her baby that September. She miscarried in a restroom toilet in the emergency room lobby while her husband called 911 for help. \u201cShe is bleeding a lot and had a miscarriage,\u201d the husband told first responders in his call, which was transcribed from Spanish in federal documents. \u201cI\u2019m here at the hospital but they told us they can\u2019t help us because we are not their client.\u201d Emergency crews, who arrived 20 minutes later and transferred the woman to a hospital, appeared confused over the staff's refusal to help the woman, according to 911 call transcripts. One first responder told federal investigators that when a Sacred Heart Emergency Center staffer was asked about the gestational age of the fetus, the staffer replied: \u201cNo, we can\u2019t tell you, she is not our patient. That\u2019s why you are here.\u201d A manager for Sacred Heart Emergency Center declined to comment. The facility is licensed in Texas as a freestanding emergency room, which means it is not physically connected to a hospital. State law requires those facilities to treat or stabilize patients, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services agency said in an email to AP. Sacred Heart Emergency\u2019s website says that it no longer accepts Medicare, a change that was made sometime after the woman miscarried, according to publicly available archives of the center's website. Meanwhile, the staff at Person Memorial Hospital in Roxboro, North Carolina, told a pregnant woman, who was complaining of stomach pain, that they would not be able to provide her with an ultrasound. The staff failed to tell her how risky it could be for her to depart without being stabilized, according to federal investigators. While en route to another hospital 45 minutes away, the woman gave birth in a car to a baby who did not survive. Person Memorial Hospital self-reported the incident. A spokeswoman said the hospital continues to \u201cprovide ongoing education for our staff and providers to ensure compliance.\u201d In Melbourne, Florida, a security guard at Holmes Regional Medical Center refused to let a pregnant woman into the triage area because she had brought a child with her. When the patient came back the next day, medical staff were unable to locate a fetal heartbeat. The center declined to comment on the case. Emergency rooms are subject to hefty fines when they turn away patients, fail to stabilize them or transfer them to another hospital for treatment. Violations can also put hospitals' Medicare funding at risk. But it\u2019s unclear what fines might be imposed on more than a dozen hospitals that the Biden administration says failed to properly treat pregnant patients in 2022. It can take years for fines to be levied in these cases. The Health and Human Services agency, which enforces the law, declined to share if the hospitals have been referred to the agency's Office of Inspector General for penalties. For Huntsberger, the OB-GYN, EMTALA was one of the few ways she felt protected to treat pregnant patients in Idaho, despite the state's abortion ban. She left Idaho last year to practice in Oregon because of the ban. The threat of fines or loss of Medicare funding for violating EMTALA is a big deterrent that keeps hospitals from dumping patients, she said. Many couldn't keep their doors open if they lost Medicare funding. She has been waiting to see how HHS penalizes two hospitals in Missouri and Kansas that HHS announced last year it was investigating after a pregnant woman, who was in preterm labor at 17 weeks, was denied an abortion. \u201cA lot of these situations are not reported, but even the ones that are \u2014 like the cases out of the Midwest \u2014 they're investigated but nothing really comes of it,\u201d Huntsberger said. \u201cPeople are just going to keep providing substandard care or not providing care. The only way that changes is things like this.\u201d President Joe Biden and top U.S. health official Xavier Becerra have both publicly vowed vigilance in enforcing the law. Even as states have enacted strict abortion laws, the White House has argued that if hospitals receive Medicare funds they must provide stabilizing care, including abortions. In a statement to the AP, Becerra called it the \u201cnation's bedrock law protecting Americans' right to life- and health-saving emergency medical care.\u201d \u201cAnd doctors, not politicians, should determine what constitutes emergency care,\" he added. Idaho\u2019s law allows abortion only if the life, not the health, of the mother is at risk. But the state's attorney general has argued that its abortion ban is \u201cconsistent\u201d with federal law, which calls for emergency rooms to protect an unborn child in medical emergencies. \"The Biden administration has no business rewriting federal law to override Idaho\u2019s law and force doctors to perform abortions,\u201d Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador said in a statement earlier this year. Now, the Supreme Court will weigh in. The case could have implications in other states like Arizona, which is reinstating an 1864 law that bans all abortions, with an exception only if the mother's life is at risk. EMTALA was initially introduced decades ago because private hospitals would dump patients on county or state hospitals, often because they didn\u2019t have insurance, said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas of the American Civil Liberties Union. Some hospitals also refused to see pregnant women when they did not have an established relationship with physicians on staff. If the court nullifies or weakens those protections, it could result in more hospitals turning away patients without fear of penalty from the federal government, she said. \u201cThe government knows there\u2019s a problem and is investigating and is doing something about that,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas said. \u201cWithout EMTALA, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-19 15:55:00",
            "content": "Shortages of popular weight loss medications are continuing amid an all-time high of drug scarcity in the United States. Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk, and Zepbound, made by Eli Lilly & Co., are in tight supply and may be hard to obtain for the next several months, according to the pharmaceutical companies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its drug shortage database on Wednesday to reflect that most doses of Zepbound have limited availability due to \"demand increase for the drug.\" MORE: Drug shortage can put patients' lives at risk, experts warn Currently, just the lowest dose of Zepbound is readily available. Patients typically start at the lowest dose and work their way up to higher doses. The FDA anticipates limited availability through the end of the second financial quarter, meaning through at least June. An injection pen of Zepbound is displayed in New York City, December 11, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters Zepbound, has the same active ingredient -- tirzepatide -- as the drug Mounjaro, which is also manufactured by Eli Lilly and also in shortage for nearly all doses. Zepbound is specifically approved for weight loss for people with obesity, while Mounjaro is approved to manage blood sugar levels in those with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise. Eli Lilly told ABC News it had experienced \"unparalleled surge in demand\" for these drugs and the company is \"working with purpose and urgency to help meet the surge in demand.\" Meanwhile, only the highest dose of Wegovy is available with the remaining doses in short supply and the shortage duration \"to be determined,\" according to the FDA website. Last year, Novo Nordisk began limiting the supply of starter doses of Wegovy after demand began outpacing supply and manufacturing capacity. Additionally, the company paused some marketing of the drug last year \"to avoid stimulating further demand.\" Similarly to the relationship between Zepbound and Mounjaro, Wegovy has the same active ingredient, semaglutide, as Ozempic. However, Ozempic is not approved for weight loss -- only for diabetes -- and is not in shortage. MORE: Senators propose 'first step' to address US drug shortages by examining supply chains \"We are aware that another manufacturer has communicated supply shortages for its obesity medicine which may have implications for Wegovy demand,\" Novo Nordisk said in a statement to ABC News. \"Our focus has and will continue to be on patients and doing what we can to ensure that people who start treatment can stay on treatment. That's why we have been thoughtfully managing shipments of Wegovy for the past year while we worked to increase our production capacity. Related Stories Bird flu virus traces found in some milk, FDA says Apr 24, 9:41 AM Remnants of bird flu virus found in pasteurized milk, FDA says Apr 23, 8:12 PM More cows are being tested and tracked for bird flu. Here's what that means 3 hours ago \"We will continue to follow our plan to gradually increase overall supply throughout the rest of the year, but it's important to recognize that overall demand will continue to exceed supply,\" the statement continued. \"This means that some patients may still have difficulty filling Wegovy prescriptions.\" All four medications -- Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro and Zepbound -- work by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1, which helps the body produce more insulin to lower blood sugar levels and slows digestion, all of which can help with weight loss. Mounjaro and Zepbound also work on a second hormone, GIP. If your pharmacy runs out of either Wegovy or Zepbound, experts recommend reaching out to neighboring pharmacies, telehealth pharmacies or even Amazon Pharmacy. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly partnered with Amazon Pharmacy to help with home delivery of Zepbound and Mounjaro. Experts also recommend speaking with your provider who prescribed the medications to discuss other possible options. The weight loss drug shortage comes amid an announcement from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and Utah Drug Information Service that drug shortages have reached an all-time high . During the first three months of 2024, there were 323 active medication shortages, the highest since the ASHP started tracking in 2001. Previously, the record high was 320 shortages in 2014.",

            "title": "In Minnesota's worst measles outbreak, a battle of beliefs over vaccines",
            "date": "2017-05-04 06:27:00",
            "content": "&#151; -- An evolving community in the big city of Minneapolis is fighting a dangerous virus -- and a battle of beliefs. The largest measles outbreak in the Minnesota city in 25 years, this April, affected 34 people primarily between the ages of 0 to 5, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. Eleven have been hospitalized. The majority, 29, of the measles cases were among Somali Minnesotans, according to the state health department , which has been working to improve vaccination rates in their community. State and local officials have been searching for any other people exposed to the virus \u2013- potentially 3,000 more -- who may be unvaccinated and vulnerable, to try and stop the spread of the disease. 15-month-old August Goepferd receives the measles, mumps and rubella booster shot at a clinic at Children's Minnesota in Minneapolis, May 2, 2017. August sat on the lap of his mom, Dr. Angela Geopferd, as registered nurse Kim Flaata administered the shot. A measles outbreak in Minnesota has sickened more than 30 children, mostly in the state's large Somali community, which has a low immunization rate. While the overall vaccine compliance rate for Minnesota kindergartners is around 90 percent, it is only about 40 percent in the Somali community, according to Kris Ehresmann, director for infectious disease at the Minnesota Department of Health. \"We've known it's going to be a matter of time before something happens,\" she said about the recent outbreak. In 2011, a similar outbreak occurred in the Somali community in Minnesota after a toddler who had visited Kenya contracted the virus. In that outbreak, 19 children and two adults were infected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health department. A report from the American Academy of Pediatrics found that in the Minneapolis Somali community, the vaccination rate had dropped precipitously from over 90 percent in 2004 to 54 percent in 2010, likely helping that outbreak to spread. Vaccination rates are believed to have dropped over concerns about autism , despite definitive research that refutes a link between vaccines and autism, according to Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and former state epidemiologist . \"Vaccinations have dropped drastically, but autism rates have stayed the same,\" Osterholm said about the sizable Somali population in Minneapolis. Osterholm said that some groups who are skeptical about vaccines have expressed distrust in public health officials trying to stop the outbreak. In addition to other concerns, some have said the vaccinations are unnecessary because the measles outbreaks have ended quickly. Osterholm said the reason is the response and \"thousands of hours\" spent by public health workers to treat the sick and isolate and vaccinate people exposed to the virus. But advocates for limiting or eliminating vaccinations have encouraged the Somali community in Minneapolis to be skeptical. On Sunday, a nonprofit group that has questioned vaccine safety held a meeting for the Somali community to advise them about their rights to decline vaccinations based on their beliefs. Patti Carroll, the director of outreach for the non-profit group called the Vaccine Safety Council of Minnesota, said the goal was to inform parents of their rights and that they could decline recommended vaccinations even during an ongoing measles outbreak. \"There is this huge fear-mongering and frenzy of fear over measles without any information over measles vaccine,\" Carroll told ABC News. She said the group is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but that they want to bring up potential vaccines risks. Among the risks she cited is the claim that vaccines are linked to autism, despite numerous academic studies involving millions of children that have found no association between the two. The group's website states their goal is to protect \"people from injuries and deaths from vaccines.\" Mark Blaxill spoke at the meeting on Sunday, aimed at parents in the Somali community, according to ABC affiliate KSTP , and told parents they could refuse vaccinations and still have their children attend daycare and receive benefits. \"The vaccination schedule for children in this country has exploded since 1986,\" Blaxill said, according to KSTP. \"And we simply do not know all of the possible negative side effects of these vaccines as a collective group of immunizations.\" Carroll said about 90 people from the Somali community were at the meeting and the group is planning further outreach. While endemic measles was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, there have been multiple outbreaks of the disease infecting hundreds in states such as Ohio and California, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported . Ehresmann said they believe about 3,000 people have been exposed to the virus and they are trying to reach out to unvaccinated people to offer vaccines or other interventions and give them guidance. \"I think it's fair to say we're expecting to see more cases,\" she told ABC News. The measles virus is one of the most infectious diseases , able to infect 90 percent of unimmunized people who are exposed to it, according to the CDC. Ehresmann said that public health department officials are focused on engaging with the community directly and continuing investigative work to diminish the spread of the outbreak. \"We're not specifically working to counteract specific things that are said because we don't want to add credibility to the argument,\" Ehresmann said about the non-profit's recent meeting. One of the most important messages the community should understand, public health experts say, is that vaccinations are for everyone. \"We vaccinate our own kids and grandkids,\" Osterholm said about people working in public health. \"It's not do as I say it's do as I do.\" The current measles vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC is supported by numerous medical organizations, including the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Academy of Pediatrics.",

            "title": "What patients need to know about new recommendations for prostate cancer screening",
            "date": "2017-04-11 13:09:00",
            "content": "&#151; -- In a decision of concern to many middle-aged men and the doctors who care for them, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF, has changed its recommendation for prostate cancer screening specifically related to the blood test that measures prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which can indicate a growing cancer. Prostate cancer is diagnosed in about 180,000 men every year and leads to roughly 26,000 deaths annually. But many men can live with the disease for years without its causing serious illness. The task force, a panel of experts supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, today is advising men between the ages of 55 and 69 to start a conversation with their doctors about whether to have a PSA test based on each patient\u2019s personal values and priorities. While a PSA test itself isn\u2019t invasive -- it requires drawing blood -- experts are concerned that patients may end up undergoing invasive procedures despite having little chance of developing an aggressive cancer. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what patients should know about the recommendation change. What should patients keep in mind when they go to the doctor? The new guidelines are relatively simple: Men between the ages of 55 to 69 should start a conversation with their doctors about whether to have a PSA test and focus on their own values and priorities. The group continues to recommend against PSA testing for men 70 and older because the harm can outweigh any benefits. What were the previous recommendations? Prostate cancer screening is notoriously rife with uncertainty, and the previous 2012 guidelines advised against PSA testing. This is in part because high levels of PSA often spur more invasive steps. Many men who have high PSA levels undergo a biopsy, which provides vital insight into whether a man has cancer but can\u2019t predict how aggressive it might be. While many prostate cancers cause no problems, men may opt for radiation or surgery, which can cause sexual impotence and/or bowel and bladder problems. The new recommendations may help patients get personalized care to address their health and specific concerns. The guidelines empower patients to talk with their doctor about personalized care tailored to their health and priorities, Dr. Jeff Karnes, a urologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the new recommendations, told ABC News. \u201cA man should be allowed to discuss with his physician whether to have a PSA ordered or not,\u201d Karnes said. Does a high PSA mean you have cancer? Dr. Alex Krist, a member of the USPSTF task force and a family medicine doctor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said a high PSA may not necessarily point to prostate cancer. Other conditions can affect the results. \u201cMany men will have a high PSA at some point in their lives, and most of those will not be prostate cancer but that will be something that the patient and doctor will be worried about\u201d and will evaluate, Krist told ABC News. Additionally, prostate cancer in many patients may not result in dangerous complications. Many people may not even be aware they have the disease. Prostate cancer is so common that one published 2015 study reported more than one-third of white men and one-half of black men ages 70 to 79 were found to have previously undiagnosed prostate cancer on autopsy. Krist said the uncertainty at every step of the way in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer makes it crucial for men to discuss the options, and their concerns, with their doctors. Why did the recommendations change? The new guidance stems from recent evidence of the benefits of screening, and from a movement among prostate specialists toward active surveillance. In this approach, doctors keep a close eye on men with a high risk of prostate cancer, rather than treating outright. \u201cThere is a close balance of benefits and harms,\u201d Krist said, \u201cand that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for men to be involved in making the decision of whether screening is right for them.\u201d Dr. Allison Bond is a resident in internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

            "title": "She was too sick for a traditional transplant. So she received a pig kidney and a heart pump",
            "date": "2024-04-24 09:01:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- Doctors have transplanted a pig kidney into a New Jersey woman who was near death, part of a dramatic pair of surgeries that also stabilized her failing heart. Lisa Pisano\u2019s combination of heart and kidney failure left her too sick to qualify for a traditional transplant, and out of options. Then doctors at NYU Langone Health devised a novel one-two punch: Implant a mechanical pump to keep her heart beating and days later transplant a kidney from a genetically modified pig. Pisano is recovering well, the NYU team announced Wednesday. She\u2019s only the second patient ever to receive a pig kidney -- following a landmark transplant last month at Massachusetts General Hospital \u2013 and the latest in a string of attempts to make animal-to-human transplantation a reality. This week, the 54-year-old grasped a walker and took her first few steps. \u201cI was at the end of my rope,\u201d Pisano told The Associated Press. \u201cI just took a chance. And you know, worst case scenario, if it didn\u2019t work for me, it might have worked for someone else and it could have helped the next person.\u201d Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of NYU Langone Transplant Institute, recounted cheers in the operating room as the organ immediately started making urine. \u201cIt\u2019s been transformative,\" Montgomery said of the experiment's early results. But \"we\u2019re not off the hook yet,\u201d cautioned Dr. Nader Moazami, the NYU cardiac surgeon who implanted the heart pump. \u201cWith this surgery I get to see my wife smile again,\u201d Pisano's husband Todd said Wednesday. Other transplant experts are closely watching how the patient fares. \u201cI have to congratulate them,\" said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Mass General, who noted that his own pig kidney patient was healthier overall going into his operation than NYU's patient. \u201cWhen the heart function is bad, it\u2019s really difficult to do a kidney transplant.\u201d More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant waiting list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting. In hopes of filling the shortage of donated organs, several biotech companies are genetically modifying pigs so their organs are more humanlike, less likely to be destroyed by people's immune system. NYU and other research teams have temporarily transplanted pig kidneys and hearts into brain-dead bodies, with promising results. Then the University of Maryland transplanted pig hearts into two men who were out of other options, and both died within months. Mass General\u2019s pig kidney transplant last month raised new hopes. Kawai said Richard \u201cRick\u201d Slayman experienced an early rejection scare but bounced back enough to go home earlier this month and still is faring well five weeks post-transplant. A recent biopsy showed no further problems. Pisano is the first woman to receive a pig organ \u2014 and unlike with prior xenotransplant experiments, both her heart and kidneys had failed. She went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated before the experimental surgeries. She'd gotten too weak to even play with her grandchildren. \u201cI was miserable,\u201d the Cookstown, New Jersey, woman said. A failed heart made her ineligible for a traditional kidney transplant. But while on dialysis, she didn't qualify for a heart pump, called a left ventricular assist device or LVAD, either. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a maze and you can\u2019t find a way out,\u201d Montgomery explained \u2014 until the surgeons decided to pair a heart pump with a pig kidney. With emergency permission from the Food and Drug Administration, Montgomery chose an organ from a pig genetically engineered by United Therapeutics Corp. so its cells don't produce a particular sugar that\u2019s foreign to the human body and triggers immediate organ rejection. Plus a tweak: The donor pig\u2019s thymus gland, which trains the immune system, was attached to the donated kidney in hopes that it would help Pisano's body tolerate the new organ. Surgeons implanted the LVAD to power Pisano's heart on April 4, and transplanted the pig kidney on April 12. There's no way to predict her long-term outcome but she\u2019s shown no sign of organ rejection so far, Montgomery said. And in adjusting the LVAD to work with her new kidney, Moazami said doctors already have learned lessons that could help future care of heart-and-kidney patients. Special \u201ccompassionate use\u201d experiments teach doctors a lot but it will take rigorous studies to prove if xenotransplants really work. What happens with Pisano and Mass General's kidney recipient will undoubtedly influence FDA's decision to allow such trials. United Therapeutics said it hopes to begin one next year. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

            "date": "2024-04-23 00:06:00",
            "content": "RENO, Nev. -- The Biden administration has taken a significant step in its expedited environmental review of what could become the third lithium mine in the U.S., amid anticipated legal challenges from conservationists over the threat they say it poses to an endangered Nevada wildflower. The Bureau of Land Management released more than 2,000 pages of documents in a draft environmental impact statement last week for the Rhyolite Ridge mine. Lithium is a metal key to the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles \u2014 a centerpiece of President Joe Biden's \u201cgreen energy\u201d agenda. Officials for the bureau and its parent Interior Department trumpeted the news, saying the progress in the review of the lithium-boron mine project \u201crepresents another step by the Biden-Harris administration to support the responsible, domestic development of critical minerals to power the clean energy economy.\u201d \u201cFederal agencies cooperating to solve issues efficiently while protecting vulnerable species and other irreplaceable resources is exactly how we will need to move forward if we\u2019re going to produce these critical minerals in the United States,\u201d said Steve Feldgus, deputy assistant Interior secretary for land and minerals management. Environmentalists vowing to fight the mine say it's the latest example of the administration running roughshod over U.S. protections for native wildlife and rare species in the name of slowing climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity, described it as \u201cgreenwashing extinction.\u201d The nonprofit conservation group first petitioned in 2019 for federal protection of the rare flower, Tiehm's buckwheat, which grows near the California line. \u201cWe believe the current protection plan would violate the Endangered Species Act, so if BLM approves it as proposed, we almost certainly would challenge it,\u201d he told The Associated Press last week. Nevada is home to the only existing lithium mine in the U.S. and another is currently under construction near the Oregon line 220 miles (354 kilometers) north of Reno. By 2030, worldwide demand for lithium is projected to have grown six times compared to 2020. The bureau said it published the draft review and opened public comment through June 3 for the new mine after Ioneer Ltd., the Australian mining company that\u2019s been planning for years to dig for lithium at this site, adjusted its latest blueprint to reduce destruction of critical habitat for the plant, which exists nowhere else in the world. Bernard Rowe, Ioneer\u2019s managing director, said lithium production could begin as early as 2027. He said the company has spent six years adjusting their plans so the mine can co-exist with the plant, invested $2.5 million in conservation efforts and committed an additional $1 million annually to ensure the plant and its surrounding habitat are protected. \u201cRhyolite Ridge will help accelerate the electric vehicle transition and secure a cleaner future for our children and grandchildren,\" Ioneer Executive Chairman James Calaway said. In addition to scaling back encroachment on the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with yellow and cream-colored blooms, the strategy includes a controversial propagation plan to grow and transplant flowers nearby \u2014 something conservationists say won't work. The plant grows in eight sub-populations that combined cover approximately 10 acres (4 hectares) \u2014 an area equal to the size of about eight football fields. They're located halfway between Reno and Las Vegas in a high-desert oasis of sorts for the plants and the insects that pollinate them. The Fish and Wildlife Service added the flower to the list of U.S. endangered species on Dec. 14, 2022, citing mining as the biggest threat to its survival. Less than a week later, the government published a formal notice of intent to begin work on the draft environmental impact statement. Three weeks after that, the Energy Department announced a $700 million conditional loan to Ioneer for the mining project it said could produce enough lithium to support production of about 370,000 electric vehicles annually for four decades. The Center for Biological Diversity said a series of internal documents it obtained from the Bureau of Land Management through a request under the Freedom of Information Act show the administration has rushed its review of the mine. Scott Distell, BLM's project manager in charge of the review, raised concerns about the expedited schedule in an email to his district boss when it suddenly was accelerated in December 2023. \u201cThis is a very aggressive schedule that deviates from other project schedules on similar projects completed recently,\" Distell wrote in the Dec. 22 email. The draft environmental impact statement lays out three different options for the project, including a \u201cno-action alternative\u201d that would mean no mine would be built. The one the bureau said it prefers anticipates Ioneer's protection plan would allow for direct destruction of about 22% of the plant's habitat in the 910 acres (368 hectares) the Fish and Wildlife Service designated as critical habitat when it listed it as endangered. That's down from an estimated 38% in an earlier version of the plan. \u201cFor an extremely rare species confined to such a small area, no amount of destruction of its critical habitat is acceptable,\u201d said Naomi Fraga, director of conservation at the California Botanic Garden. Donnelly points to the Endangered Species Act's requirement that federal agencies consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service whenever a project could affect a threatened or endangered species to ensure it won't \"result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat.\u201d \u201cReducing the destruction of this rare plant\u2019s habitat from 38% to 22% is like cutting off one leg instead of both,\" Donnelly said. \u201cThey\u2019re still dealing a fatal blow to this precious, rare wildflower.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-22 16:28:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- They watched from the courtroom or via closed-circuit television in an overflow room \u2014 roughly 140 reporters, most with laptops or other silenced electronic devices, serving up news at its most elemental and in rapid-fire fashion. There were utterances posted a few seconds after they left a lawyer\u2019s mouth. Observations on how Donald Trump is reacting. Tidbits on what testimony is causing jurors to scribble notes. \u201cLet me give you some quotes to make you feel like you\u2019re inside the courtroom,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Yasmin Vossoughian said before reading the reports of colleagues. Trump's hush money trial is illustrating the potency of live blogs as a news tool \u2014 by necessity. Television and text journalism are normally two very different mediums. Yet because New York state rules forbid camera coverage of trials and the former president's case has such high interest, blogs are emerging as the best way to communicate for both formats. During opening arguments in the case on Monday, CNN used one-third of its television screen to display short printed updates of what was going on, written by its three journalists stationed at the Manhattan courthouse. MSNBC did something similar with onscreen \u201cchyrons\u201d \u2014 superimposed text. Traditional outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press use news blogs regularly, experience that proved helpful Monday. While such blogs often supplement traditional television coverage of big events like the Academy Awards or election nights \u2014 it's known as a \u201csecond-screen\u201d experience \u2014 this time consumers had no other option. Some 140 reporters watched from the courtroom or via closed-circuit television in an overflow room, feeding news to editors. They're watched carefully themselves: Two reporters covering the trial were expelled on Monday for breaking rules prohibiting recording and photography in the overflow room, where reporters who can't get into the courtroom watch the proceedings on large screens, according to court officials. Blog dispatches sometimes felt like bits and pieces of a print story in development, like this from The Washington Post's Devlin Barrett: \u201cThey disguised what the payments were,\u201d (prosecutor Matthew) Colangelo said, speaking clearly and calmly with his hands in his suit pockets.\" Others try to set the scene: \u201cAll 18 jurors are looking directly at the veteran prosecutor, who stands at a lectern in the middle of the courtroom about halfway between them and Trump,\u201d wrote AP's Michael R. Sisak. The New York Post 's Kyle Schnitzer wrote that Trump attorney Todd Blanche wrapped up his opening statement with a hometown appeal, quoting him in saying, \u201cuse your common sense, you're New Yorkers, that's why we are here.\u201d Other observances are more analytical or seek to correct the record. The Post's Shayna Jacobs wrote that \u201cin opening statements, prosecutors focused heavily on the circumstantial evidence that they argue will help prove that Donald Trump paid off Stormy Daniels in 2016 to keep her from going public about an alleged encounter with Trump a decade before.\u201d The Times' Maggie Haberman wrote as Trump's attorney was delivering his opening statement that \"Blanche is trying to portray the the National Enquirer's practices as similar to how other news outlets operate, in terms of deciding when and how to publish a story. That is not correct.\u201d For CNN and MSNBC, which covered opening arguments more extensively Monday than Trump-friendly outlets Fox News Channel and Newsmax, there were some growing pains in getting used to the new form of storytelling. MSNBC used text less frequently, occasionally relying on the awkwardness of correspondents trying to search through notes for the latest quotes. \u201cTrump lawyer: Trump is not on the hook for what Cohen did,\u201d read one MSNBC chyron. \u201cTrump lawyer: Nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,\u201d read another. A handful of times, CNN's Jake Tapper interrupted speakers to read blog dispatches that viewers were also able to see for themselves on their screens. Still, the blog-like reports were often more helpful than on-screen analysts, particularly when they tried to predict what would take place next. One MSNBC pundit confidently predicted that Judge Juan Merchan would end the day's proceedings before a first witness was called and a CNN analyst said that first witness would wrap his testimony with a juicy revelation. Neither happened. ___ David Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press. Follow him at http://twitter.com/dbauder.",

            "date": "2024-04-23 11:40:00",
            "content": "UnitedHealth says files with personal information that could cover a \u201csubstantial portion of people in America\u201d may have been taken in the cyberattack earlier this year on its Change Healthcare business. The company said Monday after markets closed that it sees no signs that doctor charts or full medical histories were released after the attack. But it may take several months of analysis before UnitedHealth can identify and notify people who were affected. UnitedHealth did say that some screen shots containing protected health information or personally identifiable information were posted for about a week online on the dark web, which standard browsers can\u2019t access. The company is still monitoring the internet and dark web and said there has been no addition file publication. It has started a website to answer questions and a call center. But the company said it won\u2019t be able to offer specifics on the impact to individual data. The company also is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for people affected by the attack. UnitedHealth bought Change Healthcare in a roughly $8 billion deal that closed in 2022 after surviving a challenge from federal regulators. The U.S. Department of Justice had sued earlier that year to block the deal, arguing that it would hurt competition by putting too much information about health care claims in the hands of one company. UnitedHealth said in February that a ransomware group had gained access to some of the systems of its Change Healthcare business, which provides technology used to submit and process insurance claims. The attack disrupted payment and claims processing around the country, stressing doctor\u2019s offices and health care systems. Federal civil rights investigators are already looking into whether protected health information was exposed in the attack. UnitedHealth said Monday that it was still restoring services disrupted by the attack. It has been focused first on restoring those that affect patient access to care or medication. The company said both pharmacy services and medical claims were back to near normal levels. It said payment process was back to about 86% of pre-attack levels. UnitedHealth said last week when it reported first-quarter results that the company has provided more than $6 billion in advance funding and interest-free loans to health care providers affected by the attack. UnitedHealth took an $872 million hit from from the cyberattack in the first quarter, and company officials said that could grow beyond $1.5 billion for the year. Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group Inc. runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers. It also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefits management businesses, provides care and offers technology services.

            "date": "2024-04-22 18:27:00",
            "content": "Tesla\u2019s first-quarter net income plummeted 55%, but its stock price surged in after-hours trading Tuesday as the company said it would accelerate production of new, more affordable vehicles. The Austin, Texas, company said it made $1.13 billion from January through March compared with $2.51 billion in the same period a year ago. Investors and analysts were looking for some sign that Tesla will take steps to stem its stock's slide this year and grow sales. The company did that in a letter to investors Tuesday, saying that production of smaller, more affordable models will start ahead of previous guidance. The smaller models, which apparently include the Model 2 small car that is expected to cost around $25,000, will use new generation vehicle underpinnings and some features of current models. The company said it would be built on the same manufacturing lines as its current products. On a conference call with analysts, CEO Elon Musk said he expects production to start in the second half of next year \u201cif not late this year.\u201d New factories or massive new production lines won't be needed for the new vehicles, Musk said. \u201cThis update may result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times,\u201d the investor letter said. But Musk gave few specifics on just what the new vehicles will be and whether they would be variants of current models. \u201cI think we\u2019ve said all we will on that front,\u201d he told an analyst. He did say that he expects Tesla to sell more vehicles this year than last year's 1.8 million. The company also appears to be counting on a vehicle built to be a fully autonomous robotaxi as the catalyst for future earnings growth. Musk has said the robotaxi will be unveiled on Aug. 8. Shares of Tesla rose 11% in trading after Tuesday\u2019s closing bell, but they are down more than 40% this year. The S & P 500 index is up about 5% for the year. Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said the company gave guidance about its future that was clearer than in the past, allaying investor concerns about production of the Model 2 and future growth. \u201cI think for now we're likely to see the stock stabilize,\" he said. \u201cI think Tesla provided an outlook today that can make investors feel more assured that management is righting the ship.\u201d But if sales fall again in the second quarter, the guidance will go out the window and concerns will return, he said. Tesla reported that first-quarter revenue was $21.3 billion, down 9% from last year as worldwide sales dropped nearly 9% due to increased competition and slowing demand for electric vehicles. Excluding one-time items such as stock-based compensation, Tesla made 45 cents per share, falling short of analyst estimates of 49 cents, according to FactSet. The company\u2019s gross profit margin, the percentage of revenue it gets to keep after expenses, fell once again to 17.4%. A year ago it was 19.3%, and it peaked at 29.1% in the first quarter of 2022. Over the weekend, Tesla lopped $2,000 off the price of the Models Y, S and X in the U.S. and reportedly made cuts in other countries including China as global electric vehicle sales growth slowed. It also slashed the cost of \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d by one third to $8,000. Tesla also announced last week that it would cut 10% of its 140,000 employees, and Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said Tuesday the cuts will be across the board. Growth companies build up duplication that needs to be pruned like a tree to continue growing, he said. Musk has been touting the robotaxi as a growth catalyst for Tesla since the hardware for it went on sale late in 2015. In 2019, Musk promised a fleet of autonomous robotaxis by 2020 that would bring income to Tesla owners and make their car values appreciate. Instead, they've declined with price cuts, as the autonomous robotaxis have been delayed year after year while being tested by owners as the company gathers road data for its computers. Neither Musk nor other Tesla executives on Tuesday's call would specify when they expect Tesla vehicles to drive themselves as well as humans do. Instead, Musk touted the latest version of Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving software \u2014 which the company misleadingly brands as \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d despite the fact that it still requires human supervision \u2014 and said that \u201cit\u2019s only a matter of time before we exceed the reliability of humans, and not much time at that.\u201d It didn\u2019t take the Tesla CEO long to begin expounding on the possibility of turning on self-driving capabilities for millions of Tesla vehicles at once, although again without estimating when that might actually occur. He went on to insist that \u201cif somebody doesn\u2019t believe that Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company.\u201d Early last year the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made Tesla recall its \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system because it can misbehave around intersections and doesn\u2019t always follow speed limits. Tesla's less-sophisticated Autopilot system also was recalled to bolster its driver monitoring system. Some experts don't think any system that relies solely on cameras like Tesla's can ever reach full autonomy. ___ Hamilton contributed to this report from San Francisco.",

            "title": "More cows are being tested and tracked for bird flu. Here's what that means",
            "date": "2024-04-24 17:25:00",
            "content": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand \u2014 and stop \u2014 the growing outbreak. So far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people. The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Starting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested \u2014 with negative results \u2014 before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order. Here's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation: This strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska. The virus was discovered in ruminants \u2014 goats and then dairy cows \u2014 in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years. \u201cWhen we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. Flu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said. Scientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow. Finding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \u201csuggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\u201d said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota. Under pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week. The data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona. Since then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said. And then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said. \u201cThe genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\u201d Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\" Several experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start. \u201cWe need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\u201d said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school. Worobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said. \"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\u201d he said. More testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said. \u201cIncreased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\u201d Aliota said. \u201cIt helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\" Scientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon. While the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk. Also, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said. So far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms. David O\u2019Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning. \u201cThere are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we\u2019re not there,\u201d he said. As with a tornado watch, \"you wouldn\u2019t change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.\u201d Worobey said this is the kind of outbreak \u201cthat we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.\" He said ambitious screening is needed \"to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.\u201d ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

            "title": "When red-hot isn't enough: New government heat risk tool sets magenta as most dangerous level",
            "date": "2024-04-22 16:20:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- Forget about red hot. A new color-coded heat warning system relies on magenta to alert Americans to the most dangerous conditions they may see this summer. The National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday \u2014 Earth Day \u2014 presented a new online heat risk system that combines meteorological and medical risk factors with a seven-day forecast that's simplified and color-coded for a warming world of worsening heat waves. \u201cFor the first time we\u2019ll be able to know how hot is too hot for health and not just for today but for coming weeks,\u201d Dr. Ari Bernstein, director of the National Center for Environmental Health, said at a joint news conference by government health and weather agencies. Magenta is the worst and deadliest of five heat threat categories, hitting everybody with what the agencies are calling \u201crare and/or long-duration extreme heat with little to no overnight relief.\u201d It's a step higher than red, considered a major risk, which hurts anyone without adequate cooling and hydration and has impacts reverberating through the health care system and some industries. Red is used when a day falls within the top 5% hottest in a particular location for a particular date; when other factors come into play, the alert level may bump even higher to magenta, weather service officials said. On the other hand, pale green is little to no risk. Yellow is minor risk, mostly to the very young, old, sick and pregnant. Orange is moderate risk, mostly hurting people who are sensitive to heat, especially those without cooling, such as the homeless. The five categories rest on strict science-set numerical thresholds, like the Saffir Simpson hurricane scale that is familiar for its Category 1 through 5 terminology, though the heat version is specific to location, said National Weather Service Director Ken Graham. The thresholds were calculated using local weather data, local climatology that shows what people are used to at certain locations at each time of year, and localized heath and medical data for when heat illnesses and deaths show up in the area, he said. \u201cHeat is a threat to our health,\u201d CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said. She said last year more than 120,000 people were taken to the emergency room in the United States because of heat. Last year was one of the deadliest years in decades for heat, according to government records. Heat is by far the No. 1 weather cause of death in the United States, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Rick Spinrad, citing CDC data of 1,200 deaths per year. Last year was the hottest year on record globally. Both the weather service and CDC will put versions of the tool on their websites. Enter a ZIP code on the CDC dashboard to get more focus on health risks and air quality and zoom in on the weather service map online for more detailed forecasts and explanations. Both versions include heat risk for the next seven days and there is a Spanish edition. The CDC site is https://www.cdc.gov/heatrisk and the weather service version is https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/heatrisk/ There are numerous other meteorological indexes for heat, Graham said. Those include the heat index, which factors in humidity; wet bulb globe temperature, which is aimed at outdoors heat stress in the sun; and universal thermal climate index, which brings in radiation and other urban heat factors. \u201cThis is a way to simplify that,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou've got to be able to simplify the stuff so that people actually want to look at it first of all and most importantly understand it.\u201d A version of the heat risk map has been in use in California and other parts of the West for about a decade, he said. Health officials Cohen and Bernstein said even as heat gets worse with climate change, society can try to reduce deaths by better warnings and better planning. Doctors should talk with people before the summer begins about what vulnerable people should do in advance before heat waves, they said. For example, some heart medications interact with outdoor heat and people shouldn't stop taking their medications, but they could take other precautions, as can teenagers with asthma, said Bernstein, a pediatrician by training. Those precautions will be needed soon, Graham said. The Weather Service's seasonal forecast for May and June shows likely above-average temperatures for much of the United States, Graham said. \u201cSo as summer approaches, it's going to be as hot as ever and even more so if we get above average.\u201d \u201cHeat waves are getting hotter, longer, more frequent and you're getting less relief at night,\u201d Graham said, citing numerous studies in the past decade. \u201cSo it's becoming increasingly serious.\u201d __ Read more of AP\u2019s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk accused Australia of censorship after an Australian judge ruled that his social media platform X must block users worldwide from accessing video of a bishop being stabbed in a Sydney church. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese responded Tuesday by describing Musk as an \u201carrogant billionaire\u201d who considered himself above the law and was out of touch with the public. X Corp., the tech company rebranded in 2023 by Musk after he bought Twitter, announced last week it would fight in court Australian orders to take down posts relating to a knife attack on Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel in an Assyrian Orthodox church as a service was being streamed online on April 15. The material was geoblocked from Australia but available elsewhere. But the regulator that made the orders, Australia\u2019s eSafety Commission, which describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, successfully applied to the Federal Court in Sydney for a temporary global ban on sharing the video of the bishop being stabbed. In an after-hours hearing Monday, Justice Geoffrey Kennett suppressed the footage from all X users until Wednesday, when an application for a permanent ban will be heard. Hours later, Musk posted on his personal X account a cartoon that depicted a fork in a road with one path leading to \u201cfree speech\u201d and \u201ctruth\u201d and the other to \u201ccensorship\u201d and \u201cpropaganda.\u201d Musk cited Albanese telling reporters Monday that other social media platforms had largely complied with the regulator\u2019s orders to take violent content down. \u201cI\u2019d like to take a moment to thank the PM for informing the public that this platform is the only truthful one,\u201d Musk posted. Albanese berated Musk in several television interviews Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll do what\u2019s necessary to take on this arrogant billionaire who thinks he\u2019s above the law, but also above common decency,\u201d Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \u201cThe idea that someone would go to court for the right to put up violent content on a platform shows how out of touch Mr. Musk is. Social media needs to have social responsibility with it.\" Albanese told Sky News, \u201cThis is a bloke who\u2019s chosen ego and showing violence over common sense.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t about censorship. It\u2019s about common sense and common decency. And Elon Musk should show some,\u201d Albanese told Seven Network. The regulator\u2019s lawyer, Christopher Tran, had argued Monday in court that geoblocking Australia did not meet the definition of removal of the footage under Australian law. Tran said the footage was a \u201cgraphic and violent video\u201d that would cause \u201cirreparable harm if it\u2019s continuing to circulate.\u201d X\u2019s lawyer, Marcus Hoyne, said he was unable to get instructions from his San Francisco-based client because it was early Monday morning in the United States. X did not immediately respond Tuesday when asked if and how the company had complied with the court order. Musk has described eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant as the \u201cAustralian censorship commissar.\u201d Albanese said on Monday that social media posts, misinformation and dissemination of violent images had exacerbated suffering from the church attack, which the two clerics survived, as well as a knife attack at a Sydney shopping mall two days earlier that killed six people. X's Global Government Affairs team said Saturday that Inman Grant ordered it to remove some posts that commented on the church attack, but it said the posts did not violate X\u2019s rules on violent speech. X said the Australian regulator had demanded the platform \u201cglobally withhold these posts or face a daily fine of $785,000.\u201d \u201cX believes that eSafety\u2019s order was not within the scope of Australian law and we complied with the directive pending a legal challenge,\u201d the Global Government Affairs account said. \u201cWhile X respects the right of a country to enforce its laws within its jurisdiction, the eSafety Commissioner does not have the authority to dictate what content X\u2019s users can see globally.\" \u201cWe will robustly challenge this unlawful and dangerous approach in court,\u201d it added. The live feed of the church attack and social media posts that followed attracted a crowd of 2,000 people and fueled a riot against police, who barricaded the young suspected attacker inside the place of worship. The rioting injured 51 police officers and damaged 104 police vehicles, officials said. Three alleged rioters were arrested by Sunday and police released images Monday of 12 suspects they accuse of being the main instigators of the violence, taken from video of the riot. A 16-year-old boy accused of the stabbings has been charged with terrorism offenses. He has received online condemnation and praise for the attack.",

            "title": "Trump called this visa 'very bad' for Americans. Truth Social applied for one",
            "date": "2024-04-23 00:03:00",
            "content": "MIAMI -- The social media company founded by former President Donald Trump applied for a business visa program that he sought to restrict during his administration and which many of his allies want him to curtail in a potential second term. Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind Truth Social, filed an application in June 2022 for an H-1B visa for a worker at a $65,000 annual salary, the lowest wage category allowed under the program. Federal immigration data shows the company was approved for a visa a few months later. The company says it did not hire the worker. Filing for the visa sets the image of Trump the candidate, who has proposed a protectionist agenda for companies to \u201chire American,\u201d in conflict with Trump the businessman, who has said his companies will use every tool at their disposal. Records show the investment firm started by Trump\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, also filed an application and was approved to hire a foreigner as an associate under the same visa program. Trump Media & Technology Group said in a statement the application \u201cwas made under prior management,\" even though the current CEO, former House Intelligence Committee chairman and longtime Trump ally Devin Nunes, was already leading the company at the time the application was first filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. \u201cThe company has never hired \u2014 and has no plans to hire \u2014 an H-1B visa program worker. When current management learned of this application, which was made under prior management, it swiftly terminated the process in November 2022,\" the company said in a statement. An H-1B visa petition can cost companies about $5,000 per employee. Companies can withdraw petitions even after being approved. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records data doesn't note when visas are revoked. But a spokeswoman for the Labor Department, which also tracks H-1B applications, said they had no records of Truth Social requesting a withdrawal. Tech companies commonly hire employees using the H-1B program. Trump never hid the fact he used the visas before he became president, using them mostly to bring in foreign models and a few workers for his hotels and resorts, per a review of petitions filed since 2009. But with exceptions to renew existing applications, his companies appeared to have no longer petitioned for H-1B visas until Truth Social was created. Data from the Labor Department shows that an application was filed by Trump Media & Technology Group for an employee to earn $65,000. It lists as the employer Will Wilkerson, a company co-founder and former senior vice president of operations, and an Atlanta address as the job's location. Wilkerson filed a whistleblower complaint in August 2022 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging securities violations by the company. He was fired, according to The Washington Post, and is cooperating with federal authorities. His lawyers said he would not comment. Trump frequently talks about the arrivals of migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, but his policy proposals while in the White House also included curbs on legal immigration such as family-based visas and the visa lottery program. In a 2016 primary debate, Trump spoke about the H-1B visa program and said it was \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. \u201cFirst of all, I think and I know the H-1B very well. And it\u2019s something that I frankly use and I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use it. We shouldn\u2019t have it,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond of all, I think it\u2019s very important to say, well, I\u2019m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.\u201d Three months after taking office, Trump issued his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest reforms to ensure that H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. He has previously said the program was used by tech companies to get foreign workers for lower pay. During his administration, a study by the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy found the government was scrutinizing cases more by launching requests for more information from companies filing to hire foreign workers and denying more petitions. The \u201cProject 2025\u201d handbook, compiled by allies preparing for Trump\u2019s potential transition to power, says the H-1B program should be transformed \u201cinto an elite mechanism exclusively to bring in the \u2018best and brightest\u2019 at the highest wages while simultaneously ensuring that U.S. workers are not being disadvantaged by the program.\" Companies in the professional, scientific and technical services fields account for more than 60% of the total visas granted, said Nicolas Morales, an economist at the research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond who specializes in labor and migration. Morales said he has found the visa program has been beneficial for small companies to stay in business. \u201cWinning the H-1B lottery actually helps them. It increases their chances of survival,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next five years, they are more likely to stay active, particularly small companies that are very dependent on skilled labor.\u201d The applications require companies to attest they will provide the foreign workers the same benefits offered to U.S. workers and pay more than what they pay others with similar experience and qualifications or more than the typical wage for that type of occupation. Companies also have to provide a notice of the filing to the workers by posting a notice in two locations at the place of employment. Much of the criticism regarding the H-1B program is about companies offering salaries in the lower wage categories to foreign workers. The application filed by Kushner\u2019s investment firm to hire a foreign employee appears to satisfy that complaint. The Labor Department certified a document where Kushner\u2019s investment firm specified it would pay this employee a $200,000 salary, which falls under the highest wage level for the H-1B visas typically reserved for those who are experts in their field and have senior responsibilities. Recent data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shows the company was approved for a visa. Kushner has not joined the Trump campaign and has been pursuing his own business interests applying for tourism projects in the Balkans.",

            "title": "In Vietnam, farmers reduce methane emissions by changing how they grow rice",
            "date": "2024-04-22 22:14:00",
            "content": "LONG AN, Vietnam -- There is one thing that distinguishes 60-year-old Vo Van Van\u2019s rice fields from a mosaic of thousands of other emerald fields across Long An province in southern Vietnam \u2019s Mekong Delta: It isn\u2019t entirely flooded. That and the giant drone, its wingspan similar to that of an eagle, chuffing high above as it rains organic fertilizer onto the knee-high rice seedlings billowing below. Using less water and using a drone to fertilize are new techniques that Van is trying and Vietnam hopes will help solve a paradox at the heart of growing rice: The finicky crop isn\u2019t just vulnerable to climate change but also contributes uniquely to it. Rice must be grown separately from other crops and seedlings have to be individually planted in flooded fields; backbreaking, dirty work requiring a lot of labor and water that generates a lot of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80-times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide. It's a problem unique to growing rice, as inundated fields stop oxygen from entering the soil, creating the conditions for methane-producing bacteria. Rice paddies contribute 8% of all human-made methane in the atmosphere, according to a 2023 Food and Agriculture Organization report. Vietnam is the world's third-largest rice exporter, and the staple importance to Vietnamese culture is palpable in the Mekong Delta. The fertile patchwork of green fields crisscrossed by silvery waterways has helped stave off famine since the Vietnam War ended in 1975. Rice isn't just the mainstay of most meals, it is considered a gift from the gods and continues to be venerated. It is molded into noodles and sheets and fermented into wine. In busy markets, motorcyclists lug 10-kilogram (22-pound) bags to their homes. Barges haul mountains of the grain up and down the Mekong River. Rice kernels are then dried and hulled by machines before they're packed for sale in factories, lined from floor to ceiling with sacks of rice. Van has been working with one of Vietnam\u2019s largest rice exporters, the Loc Troi Group, for the past two years and is using a different method of irrigation known as alternate wetting and drying, or AWD. This requires less water than traditional farming since his paddy fields aren\u2019t continuously submerged. They also produce less methane. Using the drone to fertilize the crops saves on labor costs. With climate shocks pushing a migration to cities, Van said that it's harder to find people to work the farms. It also ensures precise amounts of fertilizers are applied. Too much fertilizer causes the soil to release Earth-warming nitrogen gases. Once crops are harvested, Van no longer burns the rice stubble \u2014 a major cause of air pollution in Vietnam and in its neighbors, as well as Thailand and India. Instead, it's collected by the Loc Troi Group for sale to other companies that use it as livestock feed and for growing straw mushrooms, a popular addition to stir-fries. Van benefits in various ways. His costs are down while his farm yield is the same. Using organic fertilizer enables him to sell to European markets where customers are willing to pay a premium for organic rice. Best of all, he has time to tend to his own garden. \u201cI am growing jackfruit and coconut,\u201d he said. Loc Troi Group CEO Nguyen Duy Thuan said that those methods enable farmers to use 40% less rice seed and 30% less water. Costs for pesticides, fertilizer and labor also are lower. Thuan said Loc Troi \u2014 which exports to more than 40 countries including in Europe, Africa, the United States and Japan \u2014 is working with farmers to expand acreage using its methods from the current 100 hectares to 300,000 hectares. That's a long way from Vietnam\u2019s own target of growing \u201chigh quality, low emission rice\u201d on 1 million hectares of farmland, an area more than six times the size of London, by 2030. Vietnamese officials estimate that would reduce production costs by a fifth and increase farmers' profits by more than $600 million, according to the state media outlet Vietnam News. Vietnam recognized early on that it had to reconfigure its rice sector. It was the largest rice exporter, ahead of both India and Thailand, to sign a 2021 pledge to reduce methane emissions at the annual United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Each year, the industry suffers losses of over $400 million, according to recent research by Vietnam\u2019s Water Resources Science Institute. This is worrying, not just for the country but for the world. The Mekong Delta, where 90% of Vietnam's exported rice is farmed, is one of the world's regions most vulnerable to climate change. A U.N. climate change report in 2022 warned of heavier flooding in the wet season and droughts in the dry season. Scores of dams built upstream in China and Laos have reduced the river's flow and the amount of sediment that it carries downriver to the sea. The sea level is rising and turning the river's lower reaches salty. And unsustainable levels of groundwater pumping and sand mining for construction have added to the problems. Changing centuries-old forms of rice farming is expensive, and even though methane is a more potent cause of global warming than carbon dioxide, it only receives 2% of climate financing, Ajay Banga, the World Bank's president, told the U.N. climate summit in Dubai last year. Combating methane emissions is the \u201cone rare, clear area\u201d where low-cost, effective and replicable solutions exist, Banga said. The World Bank is supporting Vietnam's efforts and has begun helping the Indonesian government to expand climate resilient farming as a part of more than a dozen projects to reduce methane worldwide. The hope is that more countries will follow, though there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all,\u201d said Lewis H. Ziska, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. \u201cThe one commonality is that water is needed,\u201d he said, adding that different methods of planting and irrigation can help manage water better. Growing more genetically diverse rice varieties would also help because some are more resilient to excess heat or require less water, while others might even emit less methane, he said. Nguyen Van Nhut, director of the rice export company Hoang Minh Nhat, said its suppliers are using varieties of rice that can thrive even when the water is briny and the heat is extreme. Now, the business is adapting to the unseasonal rains that make it harder to dry the rice, adding to risks from mold or insect damage. Typically, rice is dried in the sun immediately after harvest, but Nhut said his company has drying facilities in their packaging factory and also will install machinery to dry the grains closer to the fields. \u201cWe don\u2019t know which month is the rainy season, like we did before,\u201d he said. ___ The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "date": "2024-04-22 16:04:00",
            "content": "Alex Popken was a longtime trust and safety executive at Twitter focusing on content moderation before leaving in 2023. She was the first employee there dedicated to moderating Twitter's advertising business when she started in 2013. Now, she's vice president of trust and safety at WebPurify, a content moderation service provider that works with businesses to help ensure the content people post on their sites follows the rules. Social media platforms are not the only ones that need policing. Any consumer-facing company \u2014 from retailers to dating apps to news sites \u2014 needs someone to weed out unwanted content, whether that's hate speech, harassment or anything illegal. Companies are increasingly using artificial intelligence in their efforts, but Popken notes that humans remain essential to the process. Popken spoke recently with The Associated Press. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length. QUESTION: How did you see content moderation change in that decade you were at Twitter? ANSWER: When I joined Twitter, content moderation was in its nascent stages. I think even trust and safety was this concept that people were just starting to understand and grapple with. The need for content moderation escalated as we, as platforms saw them be weaponized in new ways. I can sort of recall some key milestones of my tenure at Twitter. For example, Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , where we realized for the first time, realized in a meaningful way, that without content moderation we can have bad actors undermining democracy. The necessity for investing in this area became ever more important. Q: A lot of companies, the bigger social media companies are leaning on AI for content moderation. Do you think that AI is in a place yet where it\u2019s possible to rely on it? A: Effective content moderation is a combination of humans and machines. AI, which has been used in moderation for years, solves for scale. And so you have machine learning models that are trained on different policies and can detect content. But ultimately, let\u2019s say you have a machine learning model that is detecting the word \u2018Nazi.\u2019 There are a lot of posts that might be criticizing Nazis or providing educational material about Nazis versus like, white supremacy. And so it cannot solve for nuance and context. And that\u2019s really where a human layer comes in. I do think that we\u2019re starting to see really important advancements that are going to make a human\u2019s job easier. And I think generative AI is a great example of that, where, unlike traditional. AI models, it can understand context and nuance much more so than its predecessor. But even still, we have entirely new use cases for our human moderators now around moderating generative AI outputs. And so the need for human moderation will remain for the foreseeable future, in my opinion. Q: Can you talk a little bit about the non-social media companies that you work with and what kind of content moderation they use? A: I mean, everything from like retail product customization, you know, imagine that you are allowing people to customize T-shirts, right? Obviously, you want to avoid use cases in which people abuse that and put harmful, hateful things on the T-shirt. Really, anything that has user-generated content, all the way to online dating \u2014 there, you\u2019re looking for things like catfishing and scams and ensuring that people are who they say they are and preventing people from uploading inappropriate photos for example. It does span multiple industries. Q: What about the issues that you\u2019re moderating, does that change? A: Content moderation is an ever-evolving landscape. And it\u2019s influenced by what\u2019s happening in the world. It\u2019s influenced by new and evolving technologies. It\u2019s influenced by bad actors who will attempt to get on these platforms in new and innovative ways. And so as a content moderation team, you\u2019re trying to stay one step ahead and anticipate new risks. I think that there\u2019s a little bit of catastrophic thinking in this role where you think about like, what are the worst case scenarios that can happen here. And certainly they evolve. I think misinformation is a great example where there's so many facets to misinformation and it's such a hard thing to moderate. It's like boiling the ocean. I mean, you cannot fact check every single thing that someone says, right? And so typically platforms need to focus on misinformation not to cause the most real world harm. And that\u2019s also always evolving. Q: In terms of generative AI there\u2019s some doomsday thinking that it will ruin the internet, that it will just be, you know, fake AI stuff on it. Do you feel like that might be happening? A: I have concerns around AI-generated misinformation, especially during what is an extremely important election season globally. You know, we actively are seeing more deepfakes and harmful synthetic and manipulated media online, which is concerning because I think the average person probably has a hard time. discerning accurate versus not. I think medium to long term, if I can be properly regulated and if there are appropriate guardrails around it, I also think that it can create an opportunity for our trust and safety practitioners. I do. Imagine a world in which AI is an important tool in the tool belt of content moderation, for things like threat intelligence. You know, I think that it\u2019s going to be extremely helpful tool, but it\u2019s also going to be misused. And we\u2019re we\u2019re already seeing that.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 15:18:00",
            "content": "BALTIMORE -- April Hurley\u2019s attacker entered her apartment after identifying himself as the building maintenance man \u2014 a job he should never have obtained, according to a lawsuit filed Monday that accuses the property owner and management company of engaging in negligent hiring practices. Once inside the apartment, Jason Billingsley tortured Hurley and her companion, Jonte Gilmore, according to police and the lawsuit. The victims escaped by climbing out a basement window after being set on fire, the complaint says. Days later came the brutal killing of Baltimore tech CEO Pava LaPere in September, which police also linked to Billingsley. He was ultimately arrested and charged in both cases. But what if he\u2019d never had the opportunity to commit that first attack, attorneys for Hurley and Gilmore asked during a news conference Monday morning. \u201cJason Billingsley acted alone but had an accomplice. That accomplice was the negligence and incompetence of the companies that hired him,\u201d said attorney Andrew O\u2019Connell. \u201cBy allowing this violent criminal to slip through the cracks, they not only endangered the safety of our clients but also shattered the tranquility of what it means to be home.\u201d The lawsuit alleges that the companies failed to complete an appropriate background check on Billingsley, whose criminal record included sex offenses and violence. The west Baltimore apartment building is owned by Property Pals LLC and managed by Eden\u2019s Homes LLC, according to the lawsuit. Property Pals didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Eden\u2019s Homes didn\u2019t respond to a call and text message. The Maryland Office of the Public Defender, which represents Billingsley in the criminal cases, also didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. He is also a named defendant in the civil suit. The night of her attack, Billingsley identified himself as building maintenance and said there was a flood in the kitchen, according to the complaint. As Hurley walked up the stairs, Billingsley overpowered her, beat her with a gun, bound her with duct tape, raped her and slit her throat with a serrated knife, the complaint says. He also handcuffed Gilmore and forced him into a closet before dousing both victims in gasoline and setting them on fire, according to police and the lawsuit. Police later found a backpack and other items in the bushes outside the house, including duct tape, a bleach container, a gas can and a lighter. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m sitting here in front of you guys today is honestly a miracle,\u201d Hurley said during the news conference. \u201cJason Billingsley literally tried to take my life. He tried to take my life, and this could have been prevented.\u201d Billingsley was released from prison in October 2022 after serving a shortened sentence for a 2013 rape because he earned good behavior credits behind bars. LaPere, who founded a tech startup from her dorm room at Johns Hopkins University and was named to Forbes\u2019 30 under 30 list for social impact, died from strangulation and blunt force trauma. In a bail review hearing following Billingsley\u2019s arrest, prosecutors said he had admitted to beating LaPere with a brick. He gained entry to her downtown Baltimore apartment building after waving her over to its glass door, but there\u2019s no reason to believe they knew each other, according to police. Her body was found on the building\u2019s rooftop six days after the attack on Hurley and Gilmore. Billingsley had been quickly identified as a suspect in the rape and arson case. Baltimore police said they were actively pursuing him, but they didn\u2019t immediately alert the public because they didn\u2019t think he was committing \u201crandom\u201d acts of violence. Attorneys for Hurley and Gilmore criticized the department\u2019s decision, saying they believe police failed to take the case seriously because it occurred in a disenfranchised neighborhood and the victims were people of color.",

The 27-nation EU's executive Commission said it was opening formal proceedings to determine whether TikTok Lite breached the bloc's new digital rules when the app was rolled out in France and Spain . Brussels was ratcheting up the pressure on TikTok after the company failed to respond to a request last week for information on whether the new app complies with the Digital Services Act, a sweeping law that took effect last year intending to clean up social media platforms. TikTok Lite is a slimmed-down version of the main TikTok app that lets users earn rewards. Points earned by watching videos, liking content and following content creators can then be exchanged for rewards including Amazon vouchers and gift cards on PayPal. \u201cWe are disappointed with this decision,\u201d TikTok said in a statement. \u201cThe TikTok Lite rewards hub is not available to under 18s, and there is a daily limit on video watch tasks. We will continue discussions with the Commission.\u201d The commission wants to see the risk assessment that TikTok should have carried out before deploying the app in the European Union. It's worried TikTok launched the app without assessing how to mitigate \u201cpotential systemic risks\u201d such as addictive design features that could pose harm to children. \u201cWith an endless stream of short and fast-paced videos, TikTok offers fun and a sense of connection beyond your immediate circle,\u201d said European Commissioner Thierry Breton, one of the officials leading the bloc's push to rein in big tech companies. \u201cBut it also comes with considerable risks, especially for our children: addiction, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, low attention spans.\u201d The EU is giving TikTok 24 hours to turn over the risk assessment and until Wednesday to argue its case. Any order to suspend the TikTok Lite app's reward features could come as early as Thursday. It's the first time that the EU has issued a legally binding order for such information since the Digital Services Act took effect. Officials stepped up the pressure after TikTok failed to respond to last week's request for the information. If TikTok still fails to respond, the commission warned the company also faces fines worth up to 1% of the company\u2019s total annual income or worldwide turnover and \u201cperiodic penalties\u201d of up to 5% of daily income or global turnover. TikTok was already facing intensified scrutiny from the EU. The commission already has an ongoing in-depth investigation into the main TikTok app's DSA compliance, examining whether it's doing enough to curb \u201csystemic risks\u201d stemming from its design, including \u201calgorithmic systems\u201d that might stimulate \u201cbehavioral addictions.\u201d Offices are worried that measures including age verification tools to stop minors from finding \u201cinappropriate content\u201d might not be effective.",

            "content": "A court in Russia on Monday convicted the spokesperson of U.S. technology company Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, of justifying terrorism and sentenced him to six years in prison in a swift trial in absentia, Russia's independent news site Mediazona reported. According to the outlet, the charges against Meta communications director Andy Stone stem from his remarks in 2022 following Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 that year. Stone, who is based in the United States, announced temporary changes to Meta\u2019s hate speech policy to allow for \u201cforms of political expression that would normally violate (its) rules, like violent speech such as \u2018death to the Russian invaders.\u2019\u201d In the same statement, Stone added that \u201ccredible calls for violence against Russian civilians\u201d would remain banned. The Russian authorities opened a criminal case implicating Stone and other unidentified Meta employees nonetheless, describing the statement as \u201cillegal calls to violence and killings of Russian citizens.\u201d The authorities also outlawed Meta as an extremist organization and blocked Facebook and Instagram in Russia. Both platforms \u2014 as well as X, formerly known as Twitter , which has also been blocked \u2014 were popular with Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent media and other forms of critical speech. However, they are now only accessible via VPN. Mediazona reported that Stone was initially charged with calling for terrorist activity, public calls for extremist activity and publicly justifying terrorism, but the first two charges were dropped in the final version of the indictment. The trial, in which Stone was represented by a government-appointed lawyer, began on Friday and concluded on Monday after only two hearings. Stone was sentenced to six years in a penal colony and barred from administering websites for four more years. Meta declined to comment on the verdict. In April 2022, Russia also formally barred Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg from entering the country.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 11:09:00",
            "content": "COLOGNE, Germany -- For the past year, five fit, academically superior men and women have been spun in centrifuges, submerged for hours, deprived temporarily of oxygen, taught to camp in the snow, and schooled in physiology, anatomy, astronomy, meteorology, robotics, and Russian. On Monday, the five Europeans and an Australian graduated from basic training with a new title: astronaut. At a ceremony in Cologne, Germany, ESA added the five newcomers to its astronaut corps eligible for missions to the International Space Station, bringing the total to 11. ESA has negotiated with NASA for three places on future Artemis moon missions, although those places will likely go to the more senior astronauts, according to ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher. The agency is also supplying the service module for the Orion crew capsule. ESA relies on NASA and others to get its astronauts to space. It is only the fourth astronaut class since 1978 for the 22-country agency, chosen from among 22,500 applicants. Another twelve were selected as reservists, but were not sent to basic training. Not surprisingly, the five have resumes studded with advanced scientific and medical degrees, military training, experience flying planes, helicopters, gliders and balloons, and \u201cleisure\u201d activities like rowing, scuba diving, hiking, skydiving, cycling, sailing, and kayaking, The group formed \u201ca very good team\" devoid of personal rivalry, said Aschbacher. \u201cI told them, one of you will fly first and one will fly last, and they accepted that of course, but from the heart, not just lip service ... the team spirit is very pronounced.\" Sophie Adenot, a French air force helicopter test pilot, said the group was \u201ca fantastic crew and a fantastic team.\" The moment that struck her the most was leaving the airlock for underwater space walk simulation when the instructor said, \u201cWelcome to space.\" \"And for me it was mind-blowing, I had goosebumps. ... In a few years it is going to be me in space, not in the water with safety divers.\" When she was a girl dreaming of space travel, \u201cI couldn\u2019t count the number of people who told me, this dream will never come true. You have unrealistic dreams, and it will never happen. ... Listen to yourself and don't listen to people who don't believe in you.\u201d In addition to Adenot, the ESA class consists of: \u2014 Pablo Alvarez Fernandez, a Spanish aeronautical engineer who has worked on the Rosalind Franklin Mars rover intended for a joint mission with Russia that was suspended after the invasion of Ukraine; \u2014 Rosemary Coogan, a British astronomer who has researched radiation emissions from black holes; \u2014 Raphael Liegeois, a Belgian biomedical engineer and neuroscientist who has researched degenerative diseases of the nervous system, and also flies hot-air balloons and gliders; \u2014 Marco Alain Sieber, a Swiss emergency physician who achieved sergeant rank as a paratrooper during his service with the Swiss army. The group was joined by Katherine Bennell-Pegg from Australia, who underwent training under a cooperation agreement between Australia and ESA. She remains an employee of the Australian Space Agency. It's up to the Australian agency to find a way for her to travel in space. Their yearlong basic training included preparation for the hostile environment encountered in space. They were exposed to multiple times the force of gravity in a centrifuge, and spent hours underwater using scuba gear to float around mockups of space station modules to simulate working in zero gravity. They learned how to recognize symptoms of hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, by experiencing it themselves in a low-pressure chamber. Survival training included dealing with potential splashdown in the ocean and staying warm in winter while waiting to be recovered in case a landing goes off course. On top of that came academic work on scientific topics and learning about the space station's modules and equipment. Intensive Russian language is still part of the program, even though ESA has suspended work with Russia except for the space station, where one of the working languages is Russian.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 09:07:00",
            "content": "A tipline set up 26 years ago to combat online child exploitation has not lived up to its potential and needs technological and other improvements to help law enforcement go after abusers and rescue victims, a new report from the Stanford Internet Observatory has found. The fixes to what the researchers describe as an \u201cenormously valuable\u201d service must also come urgently as new artificial intelligence technology threatens to worsen its problems. \u201cAlmost certainly in the years to come, the CyberTipline will just be flooded with highly realistic-looking AI content, which is going to make it even harder for law enforcement to identify real children who need to be rescued,\u201d said researcher Shelby Grossman, an author of the report. The service was established by Congress as the main line of defense for children who are exploited online. By law, tech companies must report any child sexual abuse material they find on their platforms to the system, which is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. After it receives the reports, NCMEC attempts to find the people who sent or received the material \u2014 as well as the victims, if possible. These reports are then sent to law enforcement. While the sheer amount of CyberTipline reports is overwhelming law enforcement, researchers say volume is just one of several problems core to the system. For instance, many of the reports sent by tech companies \u2014 like Google, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 lack important details, such as enough information about an offender's identity, the report said. This makes it hard for law enforcement to know which reports to prioritize. \u201cThere are significant issues with the entire system right now and those cracks are going to become chasms in a world in which AI is generating brand-new CSAM,\u201d said Alex Stamos, using the initials for child sexual abuse materials. Stamos is a Stanford lecturer and cybersecurity expert. The system is behind technologically and plagued by a constant challenge among government and nonprofit tech platforms: the lack of highly skilled engineers, who can get paid far higher salaries in the tech industry. Sometimes those employees are even poached by the same companies that send in the reports. Then there are legal constraints. According to the report, court decisions have led the staff at NCMEC to stop vetting some files (for instance, if they are not publicly available) before sending them to law enforcement. Many law enforcement officials believe they need a search warrant to access such images, slowing down the process. At times, multiple warrants or subpoenas are needed to identify the same offender. It\u2019s also easy for the system to get distracted. The report reveals that NCMEC recently hit a milestone of a million reports in a single day due to a meme that was spreading on multiple platforms -- which some people thought was funny and others were sharing out of outrage. \u201cThat day actually led them to make some changes,\u201d Stamos said. \u201cIt took them weeks to get through that backlog\u201d by making it easier to cluster those images together. The CyberTipline received more than 36 million reports in 2023, nearly all from online platforms. Facebook, Instagram and Google were the companies that sent in the highest number of reports. The overall number has been dramatically increasing. Nearly half of the tips sent last year were actionable, meaning NCMEC and law enforcement could follow up. Hundreds of reports concerned the same offender, and many included multiple images or videos. Around 92% of the reports filed in 2023 involved countries outside the U.S., a large shift from 2008 when the majority involved victims or offenders inside the U.S. Some are false alarms. \u201cIt drives law enforcement nuts when they get these reports that they perceive are definitely adults,\u201d Grossman told reporters. \u201cBut the system incentivizes platforms to be very conservative or to report potentially borderline content, because if it\u2019s found to have been CSAM and they knew about it and they didn\u2019t report it, they could receive fines.\u201d One relatively easy fix proposed in the report would improve how tech platforms label what they are reporting to distinguish between widely shared memes and something that deserves closer investigation. The Stanford researchers interviewed 66 people involved with the CyberTipLine, ranging from law enforcement to NCMEC staff to online platform employees. The NCMEC said it looked forward to \u201cexploring the recommendations internally and with key stakeholders.\u201d \u201cOver the years, the complexity of reports and the severity of the crimes against children continue to evolve. Therefore, leveraging emerging technological solutions into the entire CyberTipline process leads to more children being safeguarded and offenders being held accountable,\u201d it said in a statement. Among the report's other findings: \u2014 The CyberTipline reporting form doesn't have a dedicated field for submitting chat-related material, such as sextortion messaging. The FBI recently warned of a \u201chuge increase\u201d in sextortion cases targeting children \u2014 including financial sextortion, where someone threatens to release compromising images unless the victim pays. \u2014 Police detectives told Stanford researchers they are having a hard time persuading their higher-ups to prioritize these crimes even after they present them with detailed written descriptions to emphasize their gravity. \u201cThey wince when they read it and they don\u2019t really want to think about this,\u201d Grossman said. \u2014 Many law enforcement officials said they were not able to fully investigate all reports due to time and resource constraints. A single detective may be responsible for 2,000 reports a year. \u2014 Outside the U.S., especially in poorer countries, the challenges around child exploitation reports are especially severe. Law enforcement agencies might not have reliable internet connections, \u201cdecent computers\u201d or even gas for cars to execute search warrants. \u2014 Pending legislation passed by the U.S. Senate in December would require online platforms to report child sex trafficking and online enticement to the CyberTipline and give law enforcement more time to investigate child sexual exploitation. Currently, the tipline doesn't offer straightforward ways to report suspected sex trafficking. While some advocates have proposed more intrusive surveillance laws to catch abusers, Stamos, the former chief security officer at Facebook and Yahoo, said they should try simpler fixes first. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to violate the privacy of users if you want to put more pedophiles in jail. They\u2019re sitting right there,\u201d Stamos said. \u201cThe system does not work very well at taking the information that currently exists and then turning it into prosecutions.\u201d",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- Tesla knocked roughly a third off the price of its \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d system \u2014 which can\u2019t drive itself and so drivers must remain alert and be ready to intervene \u2014 to $8,000 from $12,000, according to the company website. Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk promised in 2019 that there would be a fleet of robotaxis on the road in 2020, but the promise has yet to materialize, and the system still has to be supervised by humans. The cuts, which occurred on Saturday, follow Tesla's moves to slash $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the United States late Friday. That's the latest evidence of the challenges facing the electric vehicle maker. Tesla reduced the prices of the Model Y, a small SUV which is Tesla\u2019s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the U.S., and also of the Models X and S, its older and more expensive models. Prices for the Model 3 sedan and the Cybertruck stayed the same. The price reduction came the day after Tesla\u2019s stock dropped below $150 per share, wiping out all gains made over the past year. The Austin, Texas, company\u2019s stock price has dropped about 40% so far this year amid falling sales and increased competition.

            "content": "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog said Monday that U.S. search giant Google must fix its advertising search restrictions affecting Yahoo in Japan . The Japan Fair Trade Commission said in a statement that its recent study of Google\u2019s practices showed it was undermining fair competition in the advertising market. Yahoo Japan Corp., which has since merged with the Japanese social media platform Line, began keyword-targeted search advertising services using Google's technology after the two companies formed a tie-up in 2010. The FTC alleges that Google had imposed restrictions in its search advertising agreement with Yahoo Japan that for more than seven years hindered its ability to compete in targeted search ads. An FTC investigation into whether that violated the Anti-Monopoly Law led Google to drop the restrictions. Google said in an emailed statement that it has cooperated fully with the commission's probe, and stressed the commission has not found it had outright violated anti-monopoly laws. It promised to carry out the commission's directives to offer \u201cvaluable\u201d search functions to Japanese users and advertisers. Line Yahoo declined comment. Google will be under review for the next three years, to ensure it carries out needed changes, the commission said. It did not impose any fines or other penalties on Google, which remains popular among Japanese. The commission\u2019s move follows another setback for Google in Japan. Last week, Japanese doctors filed a civil lawsuit against the company, demanding damages for what they claim are groundless derogatory and often false comments. The Tokyo District Court suit demands 1.4 million yen ($9,400) in damages for 63 medical professionals, for reviews posted on Google Maps.

            "date": "2024-04-22 04:28:00",
            "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australia n judge on Monday ruled that social media platform X must block every user in the world from accessing video of a bishop being stabbed in a Sydney church, extending the prohibition beyond users in Australia. X Corp., the tech company rebranded by billionaire Elon Musk when he bought Twitter last year, announced last week it would fight in court Australian orders to take down posts relating to a knife attack on Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel in an Assyrian Orthodox church as a service was being streamed online on April 15. The material was geoblocked from Australia but remained available elsewhere. But the regulator that made the orders, Australia\u2019s eSafety Commission, which describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, successfully applied to the Federal Court in Sydney for a temporary global ban on the sharing of video of the bishop being stabbed. In an after-hours hearing, Justice Geoffrey Kennett suppressed the footage from all X users until Wednesday, when an application for a permanent ban will be heard. X has 24 hours to \u201chide\u201d the footage from users, the judge ruled. The regulator's lawyer, Stephen Tran, had argued that geoblocking Australia did not meet the definition of \u201cremoval\u201d of the footage under Australian law. Tran said the footage was a \u201cgraphic and violent video\u201d that would cause \u201cirreparable harm if it's continuing to circulate.\" X's lawyer Marcus Hoyne said he had been unable to get instructions from his San Francisco-based client because it was early Monday morning in the United States. Musk has described eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant as the \u201cAustralian censorship commissar.\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had earlier criticized X for refusing to remove graphic posts about the knife attack on a bishop and priest at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church. Albanese said social media posts, misinformation and dissemination of violent images had exacerbated suffering from the church attack, which the two clerics survived, as well as a knife attack at a Sydney shopping mall two days earlier which killed six people. \u201cSocial media has a social responsibility,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cI find it extraordinary that X chose not to comply and are trying to argue their case.\u201d The platform\u2019s Global Government Affairs team said on Saturday Inman Grant had ordered it to remove some posts that commented on the church attack, but it said the posts did not violate X\u2019s rules on violent speech. X said the Australian regulator had demanded the platform \u201cglobally withhold these posts or face a daily fine of $785,000.\u201d \u201cX believes that eSafety\u2019s order was not within the scope of Australian law and we complied with the directive pending a legal challenge,\u201d the Global Government Affairs account said. \u201cWhile X respects the right of a country to enforce its laws within its jurisdiction, the eSafety Commissioner does not have the authority to dictate what content X\u2019s users can see globally,\u201d it said. \u201cWe will robustly challenge this unlawful and dangerous approach in court,\u201d it added. The live feed of the church attack and social media posts that followed attracted a crowd of 2,000 people and fueled a riot against police, who barricaded the young suspected attacker inside the place of worship. The rioting injured 51 police officers and damaged 104 police vehicles, officials said. Three alleged rioters had been arrested by Sunday and police on Monday released images of 12 suspects they accuse of being the main instigators of the violence, taken from video of the riot. A 16-year-old boy accused of the stabbings has been charged with terrorism offenses. He has received online condemnation and praise for the attack.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 05:05:00",
            "content": "TRIANGLE, Virginia -- President Joe Biden marked Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities \u2014 while criticizing Republicans who want to gut his policies to address climate change. Seeking reelection in November, Biden said, \u201cDespite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there are still those who deny the climate is in crisis.\" He took specific aim at supporters of former President Donald Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement. \u201cMy MAGA Republican friends don't seem to think it's a crisis,\u201d Biden said Monday during a visit to Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest Washington. \u201cThey actually want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides the funding for the vast majority of these projects, and roll back protections for clean air and clean water.\u201d The president also used the trip to announce that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states as part of his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions. Biden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. \u201cYou\u2019ll get paid to fight climate change,\u201d he said Monday. Biden made the announcements in a shady spot in Prince William Forest Park, which was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington. That was part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression. The solar grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually. Biden's announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. After his speech, Biden was asked by reporters about protests against Israel's handling of the war and replied, \u201cI condemn the antisemitic protests.\u201d But he also added, \"I also condemn those who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with the Palestinians.\u201d The White House issued a statement over the weekend denouncing \"harassment and calls for violence against Jews.\u201d Protests on college campuses, including those of Columbia and Yale Universities, prompted scores of arrests. Biden's campaign is hoping that his climate efforts can energize young voters ahead of November. Senior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to help enact it and that the Climate Corps is a way to do so. Solar energy is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid. But solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans \u2014 and potentially meaning a mingling of environment al policy with election -year politics. Forty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. \u201cBroad community-based solar is our brightest hope for protecting people and our climate from the scourge of fossil fuels,\" said Jean Su, director of the Energy Justice program at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cThese targeted investments mean low-income families get clean energy that is affordable, resilient and protects our ecosystems. It\u2019s great to see President Biden jumpstart this landmark program.\u201d The president has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm. He has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector. The new awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion \u201cgreen bank\u201d created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately affected by climate change. Among those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina. The taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank\u2019s funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers.

            "title": "A coffee roastery in Finland has launched an AI-generated blend. The results were surprising",
            "date": "2024-04-20 12:07:00",
            "content": "HELSINKI -- An artisan roastery based in the Finnish capital has introduced a coffee blend that has been developed by artificial intelligence in a trial in which it's hoped that technology can ease the workload in a sector that traditionally prides itself on manual work. It is only apt that the Helsinki-based Kaffa Roastery\u2019s \u201cAI-conic\u201d blend was launched this week in Finland, a Nordic nation of 5.6 million that consumes the most coffee in the world at 12 kilograms per capita annually, according to the International Coffee Organization. The blend \u2014 an AI-picked mixture with four types of beans dominated by Brazil\u2019s velvety Fazenda Pinhal \u2014 is the end result of a joint project by Kaffa, Finland\u2019s third-biggest coffee roastery, and local AI consultancy Elev. \u201cLeveraging models akin to ChatGPT and Copilot, the AI was tasked with crafting a blend that would ideally suit coffee enthusiasts\u2019 tastes, pushing the boundaries of conventional flavor combinations,\" Elev said. Kaffa Roastery\u2019s managing director and founder Svante Hampf told The Associated Press on Saturday that the two partners wanted to trial how AI and its different tools could be of help in coffee roasting, a traditional artisan profession highly valued in Finland. \u201cWe basically gave descriptions of all our coffee types and their flavors to AI and instructed it to create a new exciting blend,\u201d said Hampf, while showcasing \u201cAI-conic\u201d at the Helsinki Coffee Festival that annually brings together roasteries and coffee aficionados. In addition to coming up with its chosen mixture of beans from Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia and Guatemala, AI created the coffee package label and a detailed taste description saying \u201cAI-conic\u201d is \u201ca well balanced blend of sweetness and ripe fruit.\u201d Hampf acknowledged he was surprised that AI \u201csomewhat weirdly\u201d chose to make the blend out of four different type of coffee beans, rather than the usual two or three which allows distinction in taste between flavors from different origins. After the first test roasting and blind testing, Kaffa\u2019s coffee experts agreed, however, that the tech-assisted blend was perfect, and there was no need for human adjustments. According to Elev\u2019s spokesman Antti Merilehto \u201cAI-conic is a tangible example of how AI can introduce new perspectives to seasoned professionals\u201d while offering coffee lovers new taste experiences. Kaffa Roastery hopes the trial serves as an opener of dialogue between coffee professionals of things to come in the future in Finland, a nation that has both a strong coffee culture and a passion for technology with a flourishing startup scene. \u201cThis (trial) was the first step in seeing how AI could help us in the future,\u201d Hampf said, adding the project brought smoothly together \u201cthe artisan skills of a roastery\u201d and AI-provided data. \u201cI think AI has plenty to offer us in the long run. We are particularly impressed of the coffee taste descriptions it created.\u201d",

            "title": "The House votes for possible TikTok ban in the US, but don't expect the app to go away anytime soon",
            "date": "2024-04-20 13:23:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The House passed legislation Saturday that would ban TikTok in the United States if the popular social media platform's China -based owner doesn\u2019t sell its stake within a year, but don't expect the app to go away anytime soon. The decision by House Republicans to include TikTok as part of a larger foreign aid package, a priority for President Joe Biden with broad congressional support for Ukraine and Israel, fast-tracked the ban after an earlier version had stalled in the Senate. A standalone bill with a shorter, six-month selling deadline passed the House in March by an overwhelming bipartisan vote as both Democrats and Republicans voiced national security concerns about the app\u2019s owner, the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. The modified measure, passed by a 360-58 vote, now goes to the Senate after negotiations that lengthened the timeline for the company to sell to nine months, with a possible additional three months if a sale is in progress. Legal challenges could extend that timeline even further. The company has indicated that it would likely go to court to try and block the law if it passes, arguing it would deprive the app\u2019s millions of users of their First Amendment rights. TikTok has lobbied hard against the legislation, pushing the app\u2019s 170 million U.S. users \u2014 many of whom are young \u2014 to call Congress and voice opposition. But the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad concern about Chinese threats to the U.S. and where few members use the platform themselves. \u201cWe will not stop fighting and advocating for you,\u201d TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward the app\u2019s users. \u201cWe will continue to do all we can, including exercising our legal rights, to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you.\u201d The bill\u2019s quick path through Congress is extraordinary because it targets one company and because Congress has taken a hands-off approach to tech regulation for decades. Lawmakers had failed to act despite efforts to protect children online, safeguard users\u2019 privacy and make companies more liable for content posted on their platforms, among other measures. But the TikTok ban reflects widespread concerns from lawmakers about China. Members of both parties, along with intelligence officials, have worried that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over American user data or direct the company to suppress or boost TikTok content favorable to its interests. TikTok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government and has said it has not shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities. The U.S. government has not publicly provided evidence that shows TikTok shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government or tinkered with the company\u2019s popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see. The company has good reason to think a legal challenge could be successful, having seen some success in previous legal fights over its operations in the U.S.. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued. In 2020, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights. His administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. The sale never went through for a number of reasons; one was China, which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers. Dozens of states and the federal government have put in place TikTok bans on government devices. Texas\u2019 ban was challenged last year by The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which argued in a lawsuit that the policy was impeding academic freedom because it extended to public universities. In December, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have backed the app. \u201cCongress cannot take away the rights of over 170 million Americans who use TikTok to express themselves, engage in political advocacy, and access information from around the world,\u201d said Jenna Leventoff, a lawyer for the group. Since mid-March, TikTok has spent $5 million on TV ads opposing the legislation, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. The ads have included a range of content creators, including a nun, extolling the positive impacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the First Amendment. The company has also encouraged its users to contact Congress, and some lawmakers have received profanity-laced calls. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\u201d said Alex Haurek, a spokesman for the company. California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, voted against the legislation. He said he thinks there could have been less restrictive ways to go after the company that wouldn't result in a total ban or threaten free speech. \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to be well received,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the Beltway being out of touch with where voters are.\u201d Nadya Okamoto, a content creator who has roughly 4 million followers on TikTok, said she has been having conversations with other creators who are experiencing \u201cso much anger and anxiety\u201d about the bill and how it\u2019s going to impact their lives. The 26-year-old, whose company \u201cAugust\u201d sells menstrual products and is known for her advocacy around destigmatizing menstrual periods, makes most of her income from TikTok. \u201cThis is going to have real repercussions,\u201d she said. ___ Hadero reported from New York.",

            "title": "Biden signs bill extending a key US surveillance program after divisions nearly forced it to lapse",
            "date": "2024-04-20 00:47:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed legislation reauthorizing a key U.S. surveillance law after divisions over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans\u2019 data nearly forced the statute to lapse. Barely missing its midnight deadline, the Senate had approved the bill by a 60-34 vote hours earlier with bipartisan support, extending for two years the program known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Biden thanked congressional leaders for their work. \u201cIn the nick of time, we are reauthorizing FISA right before it expires at midnight,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said when voting on final passage began 15 minutes before the deadline. \u201cAll day long, we persisted and we persisted in trying to reach a breakthrough and in the end, we have succeeded.\u201d U.S. officials have said the surveillance tool, first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since then, is crucial in disrupting terrorist attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. \u201cIf you miss a key piece of intelligence, you may miss some event overseas or put troops in harm\u2019s way,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. \"You may miss a plot to harm the country here, domestically, or somewhere else. So in this particular case, there\u2019s real-life implications.\u201d The proposal would renew the program, which permits the U.S. government to collect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside the country to gather foreign intelligence. The reauthorization faced a long and bumpy road to final passage Friday after months of clashes between privacy advocates and national security hawks pushed consideration of the legislation to the brink of expiration. Though the spy program was technically set to expire at midnight, the Biden administration had said it expected its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications. Still, officials had said that court approval shouldn\u2019t be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse. Hours before the law was set to expire, U.S. officials were already scrambling after two major U.S. communication providers said they would stop complying with orders through the surveillance program, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. Attorney General Merrick Garland praised the reauthorization and reiterated how \u201cindispensable\u201d the tool is to the Justice Department. \u201cThis reauthorization of Section 702 gives the United States the authority to continue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-U.S. persons located outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important reforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of Americans\u2019 privacy and civil liberties,\" Garland said in a statement Saturday. But despite the Biden administration's urging and classified briefings to senators this week on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security, a group of progressive and conservative lawmakers who were agitating for further changes had refused to accept the version of the bill the House sent over last week. The lawmakers had demanded that Schumer, D-N.Y., allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill. In the end, Schumer was able to cut a deal that would allow critics to receive floor votes on their amendments in exchange for speeding up the process for passage. The six amendments ultimately failed to garner the necessary support on the floor to be included in the final passage. One of the major changes detractors had proposed centered around restricting the FBI\u2019s access to information about Americans through the program. Though the surveillance tool only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners. Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, had been pushing a proposal that would require U.S. officials to get a warrant before accessing American communications. \u201cIf the government wants to spy on my private communications or the private communications of any American, they should be required to get approval from a judge, just as our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution,\u201d Durbin said. In the past year, U.S. officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the U.S., including a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. But members on both the House and Senate intelligence committees as well as the Justice Department warned requiring a warrant would severely handicap officials from quickly responding to imminent national security threats. \u201cI think that is a risk that we cannot afford to take with the vast array of challenges our nation faces around the world,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. __ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-19 17:54:00",
            "content": "MADISON, Wis. -- Lake sturgeon don't need Endangered Species Act protections, federal wildlife officials announced Monday, saying that stocking programs have helped the prehistoric fish return to areas where they had vanished. The decision ends the Arizona-based Center of Biological Diversity's petition filed in May 2018 asking the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list lake sturgeon as endangered or threatened. Such listings would make harvesting the fish illegal, but without them, popular sturgeon harvest seasons in states such as Wisconsin and Michigan can continue. The center argued that overharvesting and deteriorating habitat have \u201cseverely depleted\u201d the species. Dams block access to spawning and rearing habitat and water pollution and diversions have done \u201cirreparable harm,\" the center said. \u201cThis is a disappointing decision because though some populations are well managed, overall the lake sturgeon has suffered a drastic decline,\u201d said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the center. \u201cEndangered Species Act protection would bring a comprehensive recovery plan and ongoing funding to restore these iconic fish across their former range.\u201d Chuck Traxler, the wildlife service\u2019s Midwest deputy regional director, said stocking has helped grow adult lake sturgeon populations and increase spawning, agency officials said. Putting the creatures on the list would be like going to the emergency room, and the rebounding species doesn't need that level of protection, said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean everything is good right now,\u201d he said. \"It means keep up the good work.\u201d Populations aren't at historical highs, the agency acknowledged in a December assessment, but stocking returned them to the Red River of the North between Minnesota and North Dakota, the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, portions of the Mississippi River and the Coosa River. Dam removals and habitat restoration efforts also have helped, the agency has said, citing work in 2015 to retrofit a dam on Wisconsin's Menominee River to allow spawning sturgeon to travel upstream and the removal of the Brecksville Dam on Ohio's Cuyahoga River in 2020. The agency also pointed to reef restoration work in the corridor connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie that has created a place for sturgeon to lay eggs and noted that nine of 43 toxic spots along Great Lakes shorelines have been cleaned up. The assessment also noted the adaptable species should be able to withstand warmer water due to climate change. Lake sturgeon are ancient North American freshwater fish. They're essentially living fossils, first appearing about 136 million years ago when dinosaurs ruled the planet. They resemble torpedoes, with dorsal ridges and snouts. They can grow up to 7 feet (2 meters) long and weigh up to 300 pounds (136 kilograms). Males typically live about 50 years. Females can live anywhere between 80 and 150 years. They're found in the upper and lower Mississippi River basin as well as the Great Lakes. Commercial anglers considered lake sturgeon a nuisance because they tore their nets, leading to widespread over-harvesting in the 1800s that continued into the 20th century. Lake sturgeon can't reproduce fast enough to replace the losses. It takes up to three decades before they reach spawning age, and even then they don't spawn annually. And many don't survive the trip back to their birth waters to spawn. The wildlife service has compared lake sturgeon losses to the mass destruction of the American buffalo. Twenty states have outlawed sturgeon harvesting. Fourteen of those states have listed lake sturgeon as threatened or endangered. Volunteers and Wisconsin natural resources officials have been guarding spawning sturgeon from poachers on the Wolf River for 30 years. Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin still hold hook-and-line lake sturgeon fishing seasons. Michigan and Wisconsin hold sturgeon spearing seasons each winter as well where anglers drill holes through lake ice and impale sturgeon as they swim past. The Wisconsin natural resources department reported 432 sturgeon were taken in February, down from 1,405 in 2023. Warm weather and poor ice conditions led to the diminished return, according to the department. Michigan officials set the total harvest limit at just six sturgeon but ended up canceling due to warm weather and unsafe ice conditions. Those states' seasons are so tightly regulated that the harvests don't impact the species overall, said Lori Nordstrom, the wildlife service\u2019s Midwest assistant regional director of ecological services. Michigan and Wisconsin, for example, allow an angler to take only one sturgeon per year. Minnesota anglers must release any sturgeon they catch in inland waters. Wisconsin regulations are designed to keep the harvest rate below 5%, with all tag fees going to the state's sturgeon conservation program, according to the wildlife service. Leaders of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization that works to rehabilitate sturgeon in Wisconsin and Michigan and supports harvesting the fish, praised the wildlife service's decision Monday. They said the ruling enables the states to continue managing sturgeon and allows harvesting to continue, which in turn helps researchers learn more about the ancient creatures. \"We\u2019re very happy with it,\" said Jim Patt, president of the Southwest Chapter of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, one of five chapters along the Lake Winnebago system, which hosts Wisconsin's spearing season. \"This is a big thing. we can keep our research going and keep our population strong and continue what we\u2019ve been doing.",

The National Weather Service said nearly 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of rain fell in a short time late Thursday afternoon and evening in parts of Allegheny County. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that some southern sections of the county got more than 4 inches as they got stuck under heavier bands within the storm system. Rescue crews in the Pittsburgh suburb of Oakdale used watercraft to evacuate or rescue some residents, while officials in nearby Etna issued an emergency evacuation notice as Pine Creek breeched its banks at over 14 feet (4.3 meters). For the second time in a week, flood warnings were issued in West Virginia along the Ohio River, which was forecast to crest in the Pittsburgh area at above 25 feet late Friday into Saturday \u2014 well into flood stage. The river was at nearly 22 feet late Friday morning, a rapid rise from about 16.5 feet on Thursday morning, before the heavy rains moved into the region. In Parkersburg, a portion of a loose barge struck a CSX railroad trestle spanning the swollen Little Kanawha River. Video from WTAP-TV showed the barge made contact with the trestle Friday morning as a train was moving across it before a towboat brought the barge until control. CSX was inspecting the trestle for structural damage. The Little Kanawha flows into the Ohio River. Parts of New England were also dealing with flooding as more rain came early Friday. Strong winds were also possible throughout the region for most of the day. Flood warnings were also in effect in several towns south of Hartford along the Connecticut River, which was expected to swell above 8 feet (2.4 meters), a foot above flood stage. The weather service advised boaters to be prepared for a period of swift river flows. In West Virginia, roads in at least 20 counties remained impassable Friday due to flooding from heavy rains Thursday night, according to the state Department of Transportation. Crews had to clear storm drains by hand that were overwhelmed by runoff on one section of Interstate 64 in Charleston. In Michigan, Consumers Energy reported about 67,000 customers without power in the western part of the state Friday night due to high winds. Meanwhile, thousands of residents in southeastern New York who lost power when severe storms moved through the region late Thursday had been restored by late Friday afternoon. But roughly 7,600 outages were still reported in Pennsylvania and another 5,000 outages in Maine and New Hampshire, according to poweroutage.us. The severe weather came after other storms socked the Southeast this week, prompting a few tornado warnings and causing flash flooding and at least one death. An EF-1 tornado struck in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, on Thursday night, damaging and knocking down trees, including one that fell on a house, the weather service\u2019s Blacksburg, Virginia, office confirmed in a statement Friday. The tornado with estimated peak winds of 105 to 110 mph (169 to 177 kph) touched down around 6:45 p.m. and its path was about 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) long and 300 yards (274.32 meters) wide, the weather service said.

            "content": "SLIDELL, La. -- Severe storms blamed for a death in Mississippi spawned a tornado that demolished buildings in one Louisiana city Wednesday while inundating streets in low-lying New Orleans with hours of steady rain that snarled traffic and strained the city\u2019s antiquated drainage system. Severe weather stretched across much of the Gulf South with reports of damage from Texas to the Florida panhandle. More than 30,000 homes and businesses were without power Wednesday night in Louisiana's St. Tammany Parish, where a tornado struck the city of Slidell, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of New Orleans. It ripped roofs off buildings and partially collapsed others in and around the city of about 28,000 people. Authorities said first responders had to rescue people trapped in one heavily damaged apartment building. At a Wednesday night news conference, Slidell Mayor Greg Cromer estimated about 75 homes and businesses were damaged in the city. Parish President Mike Cooper said assessments were still underway, but he estimated that hundreds more homes were damaged outside the city. Police video showed tree limbs littering the streets and flooded yards that resembled Louisiana swamps. Outside a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, a car was on its side, power poles leaned toward the ground and large pieces of the restaurant\u2019s trademark golden arches were strewn about. \u201cI\u2019ve never talked to God so much before in my life,\u201d Robin Marquez said after huddling with coworkers in a two-story building where the roof was ripped away and walls caved in. There were no reports of deaths or critical injuries in Slidell. The National Weather Service said in a social media post Wednesday night that initial surveys of the damage indicate the area was hit by a category EF-1 tornado, with winds anywhere from 86 mph (138 kph) to 110 miles per hour (177 kph). More surveys and analyses were planned to confirm the twister's strength and path. Close to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Orleans. It came as the system of pipes and pumps that drains the city dealt with problems with its power generating system, forcing workers to divert power from one area to another as needed. \u201cDuring intense rain, the mission sometimes shifts from keeping the streets dry to draining them as quickly as possible,\u201d the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board, which operates the system, said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. Hours after the rain ended, floodwaters lingered in some neighborhoods in New Orleans and in neighboring Jefferson Parish. In Mississippi, the death of Shirley Wilson, 64, was attributed to the storm. Wilson had several medical conditions that required her to have access to an electric oxygen machine at all times, Scott County Sheriff Mike Lee said. When her home in the central Mississippi county lost power, her oxygen machine shut down. Emergency responders couldn't reach her until about 20 minutes after her grandchild called 911 early Wednesday, and she was pronounced dead. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said 72 homes were damaged. In Texas, several people were rescued from homes and vehicles early Wednesday morning when flooding inundated parts of Jasper County, near the Louisiana line, authorities said. All major roads into Kirbyville, a Jasper County town of about 2,000 people, were shut down early Wednesday due to the flooding, the sheriff's office said. Shelters were being set up after about 50 people were displaced from their homes, Billy Ted Smith, the Jasper County emergency management coordinator, said. He estimated the displaced people came from about 20 flooded homes and said there had been around half a dozen people rescued from vehicles. He said no major injuries were reported. In the Houston suburb of Katy, strong thunderstorms that passed through the area around 2 a.m. Wednesday collapsed part of the roof of a Firestone repair shop. Storms also damaged businesses and cars in a nearby strip mall, sending a large air conditioning unit that had been on the roof crashing to the parking lot, officials said. No one was inside the repair shop, but employees were working at a nearby sports bar when the thunderstorms rolled through, Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen told reporters later Wednesday morning. \u201cWe were blessed that no lives were lost,\u201d Christensen said, adding that only minor injuries were reported. Some of the damage in Katy had preliminarily been determined to have been caused by an EF-1 tornado with estimated maximum winds of around 90 mph (145 kph), National Weather Service meteorologist Bradley Brokamp said. Photos posted on social media showed heavy damage to a church in Port Arthur, Texas, where city officials said they were also dealing with downed trees and powerlines. In Mississippi, the sheriff sent out an urgent warning Wednesday to people in parts of Yazoo County, just northwest of Jackson, about a levee failure there. The sheriff's office called for the evacuation of one subdivision. County officials continued to monitor the levee, WAPT-TV reported. ___ This story has updated to correct the spelling of Mayor Greg Cromer's first name. ___ McGill reported from New Orleans.

Some deaths occurred when lightning struck farmers harvesting wheat. Rains caused dozens of houses to collapse in the northwest and in eastern Punjab province. Arfan Kathia, a spokesman for the provincial disaster management authority, said 21 people had died in Punjab, where more rains were expected this week. Khursheed Anwar, a spokesman for the disaster management authority in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, said 21 people died there. Rain also lashed the capital, Islamabad, and killed seven people in southwestern Baluchistan province. Streets flooded in the northwestern city of Peshawar and in Quetta, the Baluchistan capital. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in televised remarks that he had ordered authorities to provide relief aid. Pakistan\u2019s water reservoirs would improve because of the rains, he said. Rafay Alam, a Pakistani environmental expert, said such heavy April rainfall is unusual. \u201cTwo years ago, Pakistan witnessed a heat wave in March and April and now we are witnessing rains and it is all of because of climate change, which had caused heavy flooding in 2022,\u201d he said. In 2022, downpours swelled rivers and at one point inundated one-third of Pakistan, killing 1,739 people. The floods also caused $30 billion in damage. Meanwhile, heavy flooding from seasonal rains in Afghanistan killed 33 people and injured 27 others in three days, according to Abdullah Janan Saiq, the Taliban\u2019s spokesman for the State Ministry for Natural Disaster Management. More than 600 houses were damaged or destroyed while around 200 livestock died. The flooding also damaged large areas of agricultural land and more than 85 kilometers (53 miles) of roads, he said.

            "content": "OTTAWA, Ontario -- Canada's emergency preparedness minister warned Wednesday the country's wildfire season could be more explosive than last year when it led to unprecedented smoke conditions across much of the country and into the United States. Persistent drought and months of above-average temperatures have raised the risk of a repeat of last year\u2019s record-breaking wildfires, prompting federal ministers to wave a red warning flag about the desperate need to address climate change. \u201cWe can expect that the wildfire season will start sooner, end later and potentially be more explosive,\u201d Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan told a news conference. The Canadian wildfire season runs from May through October. The 2023 fire season was Canada\u2019s worst on record, burning more than 15 million hectares and forcing more than 230,000 people from their homes. Smoke from Canadian wildfires poured into the U.S. East Coast and Midwest last June. A briefing document forecasting the fire risk for the spring shows conditions are already ripe this year for an early and above-normal fire risk from Quebec all the way to British Columbia in both April and May. The forecast is based on having had a warmer than normal winter with minimal snow and widespread drought, particularly in the Canadian Prairies. There is also a high probability for above normal temperatures in April, May and June. Human activity is typically the main fire risk factor in the spring, said Michael Norton, the director general of the Northern Forestry Centre at Natural Resources Canada. That can include careless burning, campfires, fireworks and the heat from off-road vehicles igniting grass or other debris on the ground. Lightning becomes a primary source of wildfires during the summer. Sajjan said Canada has been working for months to prepare for the upcoming season, and promised additional funding for firefighting equipment and training. ___ Follow AP\u2019s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",

            "date": "2024-04-23 00:11:00",
            "content": "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- A movement to ban book bans is gaining steam in Minnesota and several other states, in contrast to the trend playing out in more conservative states where book challenges have soared to their highest levels in decades. The move to quash book bans is welcome to people like Shae Ross, a queer and out Minnesota high school senior who has fought on the local level against bans on books dealing with sexuality, gender and race. Ross, 18, said she is encouraged to see her governor and leaders of other states are taking the fight statewide. \u201cFor a lot of teenagers, LGBT teenagers and teenagers who maybe just don\u2019t feel like they have a ton of friends, or a ton of popularity in middle or high school ... literature becomes sort of an escape.\u201d Ross said. \u201cEspecially when I was like sixth, seventh grade, I\u2019d say reading books, especially books with gay characters ... was a way that I could feel seen and represented.\u201d Minnesota is one of several Democratic-leaning states where lawmakers are now pursuing bans on book bans. The Washington and Maryland legislatures have already passed them this year, while Illinois did so last year. It was a major flashpoint of Oregon's short session, where legislation passed the Senate but died without a House vote. According to the American Library Association, over 4,200 works in school and public libraries were targeted in 2023, a jump from the old record of nearly 2,600 books in 2022. Many challenged books \u2014 47% in 2023 \u2014 had LGBTQ + and racial themes. Restrictions in some states have increased so much that librarians and administrators fear crippling lawsuits, hefty fines and even imprisonment if they provide books that others regard as inappropriate. Already this year, lawmakers in more than 15 states have introduced bills to impose harsh penalties on libraries or librarians. Conservative parents and activists argue that the books are too sexually explicit or otherwise controversial, and are inappropriate, especially for younger readers. National groups such as Moms for Liberty say parents are entitled to more control over books available to their children. But pushback is emerging. According to EveryLibrary, a political action committee for libraries, several states are considering varying degrees of prohibitions on book bans. A sampling includes California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, though some in conservative states appear unlikely to pass. One has also died in New Mexico this year. One such bill is awaiting Democratic Gov. Wes Moore\u2019s signature in Maryland. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill last month that sets a high bar for removing challenged materials, especially those dealing with race, sexual orientation and gender identity. A version pending in New Jersey would protect librarians from civil or criminal liability. Some proposals are labeled \u201cFreedom to Read\u201d acts. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so critical here. The voluntary nature of reading,\u201d said Martha Hickson, a librarian at North Hunterdon High School in New Jersey. \u201cStudents can choose to read, not read, or totally ignore everything in this library. No one is asking them to read a damn thing.\u201d Hickson recalled how parents first suggested her book collections contained pedophilia and pornography during a school board meeting in 2021. She watched the livestream in horror as they objected that the novel \u201cLawn Boy\u201d and illustrated memoir \u201cGender Queer\u201d were available to students and suggested she could be criminally liable. \u201cTears welled up, shaking\" Hickson said. \u201dBut once my body got done with that, my normal attitude, the fight side kicked in, and I picked up my cellphone while the meeting was still going on and started reaching out.\u201d Book bans have been a sore point for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former high school teacher. The Minnesota Senate passed his proposal this month. It would prohibit book bans in public and school libraries based on content or ideological objections and require that the key decisions about what books will or won't be offered be made by library professionals. The state House is considering an approach with more teeth, including penalties and allowing private citizens to sue to enforce it. \u201cI\u2019m working with stakeholders, with the Department of Education, librarians, school districts and their representatives,\" said Democratic Rep. Cedrick Frazier, of New Hope. \"We\u2019re working to tighten up the language, to make sure we can come to a consensus, and just kind of make sure that everybody\u2019s on the same page.\u201d Ross, a student at Jefferson High School in Bloomington, was alarmed when she heard last year that conservative groups were organizing in her community to ban books based on their content. So she and her friends got organized themselves, and they helped persuade their school board to make it much harder to remove books and other materials from their libraries and classrooms. Because of her activism, Ross was invited when Walz went to Como Park Senior High School in St. Paul last month to view a display of books banned elsewhere. The governor called book bans \u201cthe antithesis of everything we believe\u201d and denounced what he depicted as a growing effort to bully school boards. At a House hearing last month, speakers said books by LGBTQ+ and authors of color are among those most frequently banned. Karlton Laster, director of policy and organizing for OutFront Minnesota, who identifies as Black and queer, said reading their works helped him \u201ccommunicate my hard feelings and truths to my family and friends,\u201d and helped him come out to his family. Kendra Redmond, a Bloomington mother with three children in public schools, testified about efforts to push back against a petition drive by conservatives to pull about 28 titles from the city\u2019s school libraries. Pushback from Ross, Redmond and others succeeded. The Bloomington School Board last month made it much harder to seek removals. Parents can still restrict access by their own children to material they deem objectionable. Many challenges in the district came from the Bloomington Parents Alliance. One of its leaders, Alan Redding, recalled how his son's 9th grade class was discussing a book a few years ago when graphic passages about date rape were read aloud in class. He said his son and other kids were unprepared for something so explicit. \u201cThey were clearly bothered by this and disgusted,\u201d Redding said. \u201dMy son absolutely shut down for the semester.\" Minnesota Republican lawmakers have argued that instead of worrying about book bans, they should be focusing instead on performance in a state where just under half of public school students can read at grade level. \u201cEvery book is banned for a child that doesn\u2019t know how to read,\u201d said GOP Rep. Patricia Mueller, a teacher from Austin. ___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey. Associated Press reporters Claire Rush in Portland, Oregon, and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this story.",

            "title": "PEN America calls off awards ceremony amid criticism over its response to Israel-Hamas war",
            "date": "2024-04-22 13:02:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- Facing widespread unhappiness over its response to the Israel-Hamas war, the writers\u2019 group PEN America has called off its annual awards ceremony. Dozens of nominees had dropped out of the event, which was to have taken place next week. PEN, a literary and free expression organization, hands out hundreds of thousands of dollars in prizes each year, including $75,000 for the PEN/Jean Stein Award for best book. But with nine of the 10 Jean Stein finalists withdrawing, along with nominees in categories ranging from translation to poetry, continuing with the ceremony at The Town Hall in Manhattan proved unworkable. Among those dropping out was debut novel finalist Rachel Eliza Griffiths, wife of former PEN president Salman Rushdie. \u201cThis is a beloved event and an enormous amount of work goes into it, so we all regret this outcome but ultimately concluded it was not possible to carry out a celebration in the way we had hoped and planned,\u201d PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel said in a statement Monday. The cancellation comes as tensions over the war have spread throughout the country, from college campuses to political events to roadways, which at times have been blocked by protesters everywhere from Illinois to California. Since the war began last October, authors affiliated with PEN have repeatedly denounced the organization for allegedly favoring Israel and downplaying atrocities against Palestinian writers and journalists. In an open letter published last month, and endorsed by Naomi Klein and Lorrie Moore among others, the signers criticized PEN for not mobilizing \u201cany substantial coordinated support\u201d for Palestinians and for not upholding its mission to \u201cdispel all hatreds and to champion the ideal of one humanity living in peace and equality in one world.\u201d PEN has responded by citing that it has condemned the loss of life in Gaza, called for a ceasefire and helped set up a $100,000 emergency fund for Palestinian writers. Last week, PEN America President Jennifer Finney Boylan announced that a committee was being formed to review the organization\u2019s work, \u201cnot just over the last six months, but indeed, going back a decade, to ensure we are aligned with our mission and make recommendations about how we respond to future conflicts.\u201d Critics have said that the relief fund is too small and noted that PEN waited until March to endorse a ceasefire, five months after the war began. Stein finalists had included Justin Torres' \u201cBlackouts,\u201d winner last fall of the National Book Award for fiction, and Catherine Lacey's \u201cBiography of X.\u201d At the request of the estate for Jean Stein, an author and oral historian who died in 2017, the prize money will be donated to the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund. \u201cJean Stein was a passionate advocate for Palestinian rights who published, supported, and celebrated Palestinian writers and visual artists,\" reads a statement from Katrina Vanden Heuvel, Wendy Vanden Heuvel and Bill Clegg, on behalf of the Stein estate. \u201cWhile she established the PEN America award in her name to bring attention to and provide meaningful support to writers of the highest literary achievement, we know she would have respected the stance and sacrifice of the writers who have withdrawn from contention this year.\u201d Camille T. Dungy's \u201cSoil\u201d had been the only remaining Stein award contender. PEN announced Monday that judges had selected a handful of winners, among them Javier Fuentes' \u201cCountries of Origin\u201d for debut novel, the PEN/Hemingway award. Playwright/screenwriter Tony Kushner will still receive the PEN/Mike Nichols Writing for Performance Award. Other honorary awards include the PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature, given to the late Maryse Cond\u00e9. Some authors have called for the resignation of Nossel and other top officials. Lacey, in an Instagram post last week, wrote that PEN needed to \u201cmake big changes in the leadership and move into a new era.\u201d More than a dozen awards finalists endorsed a recent letter that demanded Nossel, Boylan and others step down and alleged that PEN had \u201cshown blatant disregard of our collective values.\u201d A PEN spokesperson said it had no plans to respond to calls for Nossel and others to resign. PEN's other high-profile spring events \u2014 the \"World Voices\" festivals in New York and Los Angeles, and the gala at the American Museum of Natural History \u2014 will go ahead as scheduled. Klein and Moore are among the writers who have said they will not attend the World Voices festival, which Rushdie helped establish 20 years ago. Rushdie and other former PEN presidents, including Jennifer Egan and Andrew Solomon, had recently published a letter urging the literary community to participate in the festival. \u201cThe festival was conceived amid conflict to draw together diverse authors and thinkers at a time of deepening and deadly geopolitical tension after 9/11,\u201d the letter reads in part. \u201cWe believe in PEN America and the festival and urge that, even at a time of discord, readers and writers will once again find a way to come together to jointly quest for insight and inspiration.\u201d",

            "title": "Phish fans are famously dedicated. What happens when they enter the Sphere?",
            "date": "2024-04-23 15:12:00",
            "content": "LAS VEGAS -- Adele, Mariah Carey and Garth Brooks tower over the Las Vegas Strip, peering out from billboards advertising their various casino residencies. But the 20,000 fans marching toward the glowing Sphere last week were there for a band that many Strip visitors have no idea exists. Over the past 40 years, legions of dedicated Phish fans have followed the Vermont jam band no matter where it goes. This time, it happened to be Las Vegas, for four nights at the $2.3 billion immersive arena. No two Phish shows are the same, and while the band had played Vegas 26 times before, the Sphere offered a game-changing canvas for its signature light shows. The fans came in sequined, glittery dresses and tie-dye alike, in button-down shirts and overalls printed with the band's red doughnut logo. Once inside, they were greeted with a LED screen the size of a football field. Over 68 songs over the four nights, co-creative director Abigail Rosen Holmes would use that expanse to drive fans across bold visual worlds inspired by the four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas and plasma. As Phish jammed, the Sphere's screens became an art show, taking the audience through flowing streams of color and simple dots of light, around an enchanted lake and a field of psychedelic trees, and through a car wash (yes, a car wash). \u201cIt gives me hope,\u201d said Sean Marmora, 31, who traveled from New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring that they\u2019re pushing boundaries and doing things that they have never done before.\u201d Some displays were more abstract \u2014 during \u201cSand\u201d and \u201cChalkdust Torture,\u201d specks of light danced on screen in time to the music \u2014 while others were easier to discern: \u201cBathtub Gin\u201d featured computer-generated people on floats made of donuts, pineapples and pizza slices in a wave pool. During \u201cMaze,\u201d a narrow line of video blew up into bits across the screen. For \u201cLeaves,\u201d hundreds of digital balloons joined the very real balloons flying up inside the Sphere. \u201cIt was a very different Phish show, so special in its own right,\u201d said Tim Urbashich, 38, from Wisconsin. \u201cThis is a whole evolutionary experience in what\u2019s happening. They deserve visual representation of their music.\u201d Phish's light shows are typically driven by Chris Kuroda, whom fans have nicknamed CK5 \u2014 as in, the fifth member of the band. Kuroda was still heavily involved in the shows at the Sphere, albeit with a stripped-down light setup offsetting the screen. Phish frontman Trey Anastasio said Kuroda played a key role in fighting against the \u201ctyranny of the wall\u201d of visuals. On Saturday night, the screen lit a digital version of the band ablaze during \u201cFuego,\u201d eventually subsiding into a calm blue. As the real band jumped into \u201cGolden Age,\u201d Kuroda lit them in his signature soft purple and yellow spotlights. Holmes says the production team learned to be looser over the course of the Vegas run, refining and adopting subtle changes to make the visuals more responsive to the music. \u201cThis is such a new and different environment, where we started trying to make everything perfect. And then being more comfortable, taking chances and pushing things a bit further,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cI think Chris Kuroda and I were able to reach further and mesh better as the nights went on.\u201d As much as the Sphere shows will be remembered for the visuals, though, it\u2019s the music that ultimately makes Phish. No song was repeated, and the band took advantage of the ability to isolate sounds across the room\u2019s 167,000 speaker drivers. Anastasio says he was proud the band could still go in without a plan. Most large visual concert experiences include a click track to know when to hit certain marks. Phish insisted on being able to improvise. \u201cI felt like if we didn\u2019t have that element, it wouldn\u2019t be a Phish concert,\u201d Anastasio said. At the end of Sunday night\u2019s show, Anastasio vowed to return to the Sphere. Phish was only the second band to play it after U2 opened it with a 40-show run. Dead and Company are scheduled to play there this summer. Meanwhile, Phish will release its 16th studio album, \u201cEvolve,\u201d in July, when it will also launch a summer tour. \u201cAs long as the four of us are together and walking this planet, I would like to think that Phish exists and that we can keep playing,\u201d McConnell said of the band's stamina and longevity. So much of the band\u2019s time together is spent thinking about processes and new approaches, he said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t exactly know where it goes and where it\u2019s going. But I have a good feeling that it\u2019s going to go on for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI really hope it does.\u201d As long as Phish keeps going, so too will its community. Both Marmora and Urbashich were among the dozens of artists selling their Phish-inspired work at the PhanArt show that pops up at the band's stops. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying here to find something special,\u201d Urbashich said. \u201cYou have to open up your mind to the simplest things. It\u2019s so out there and abstract. If you don\u2019t give it patience you might not think it\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-23 08:01:00",
            "content": "PASADENA, Calif. -- When Jon Bon Jovi agreed to let director Gotham Chopra follow him with a documentary camera to delve into the history of his band, Bon Jovi, he didn't anticipate it would catch him at a major low point in his career. The band was launching a tour, and despite doing all he could do to be vocally ready, the \u201cLivin' on a Prayer\u201d singer struggled through songs and couldn't hit the notes the way he used to. Critics noticed and wrote about it. A review from Pioneer Press in St. Paul, Minnesota, said: \u201cIt felt like he had forgotten how to sing.\u201d In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bon Jovi said the reaction at the time was \u201cheartbreaking.\" After exhausting holistic options, he saw a doctor who said one of his vocal cords was atrophying. \u201cThis was unique. It wasn't a nodule. The strong (vocal cord) was pushing the weak one around, and suddenly, my inabilities were just exacerbated,\" said Bon Jovi. He underwent major surgery and is still recovering. \u201cEvery day is sort of like doing curls with weights and just getting them both to be the same size and to function together.\u201d This year has been a turning point. In February, he performed for an audience for the first time since his surgery at the MusiCares Person of the Year benefit gala where he was also named Person of The Year. The band's next album, \u201cForever\u201d hits stores June 7, and its first single \u201cLegendary\u201d is out now. The four-part, \u201cThank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story,\" debuts Friday on Hulu . In a Q & A, Bon Jovi talks about his voice, his famous hair, the music industry and his work ethic. Answers have been edited for clarity and brevity. BON JOVI: I\u2019m doing great. The record was easy to do. The process has been steady. Would I like it to be a light switch? Yeah. I said to the doctor, 'I want to flip the switch and be done with this.\u2019 It\u2019s just not how it works. Like an athlete coming back from an ACL tear or whatever, it just takes time. The therapy is still intensive and yet I\u2019m confident that it gets progressively better. BON JOVI: Not in as much where he sat down and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this idea.' Really, I was a byproduct of what was the 80s. Those were my baby pictures. I love laughing at them. Now, I can jokingly at least say, \u2018After 40 years of a career, I still have all my hair.\u2019 That is a good thing. Genetics works in my favor. BON JOVI: I do, on occasion. My day job then comes back to get in the way. In truth, I've got a big record coming out, and I\u2019m hoping to go out on the road, so I don\u2019t have time for it. And I respect the craft far too much to think I\u2019m going to walk on a set and hit my marks and call that acting. BON JOVI: If you\u2019re not going to be great, the guy that\u2019s coming in tomorrow night is going to be better. This isn\u2019t a career that you should take lightly. There\u2019s a million other young guys that are waiting to take your spot. And there are no guarantees in this business...You have to win hearts in order to win people's hard-earned dollar. If you\u2019re asking them to stay with you for four decades, that\u2019s a task. You better be one of the greats or else good luck. BON JOVI: We never had a big falling out. He quit 10 years ago. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re not in contact or anything like that, but he was choosing to, as a single dad, raise his child. The door is always open if he wants to come up and sing a song. I mean, there\u2019s many of them that we co-wrote together. That's a great part of both of our lives. There\u2019s no animosity here. BON JOVI: For some, it makes sense because they need to. For some, it makes sense because they want to. I just find (Bon Jovi's music) to be my baby, and I have no desire at this juncture in my life to ever even consider it. BON JOVI: Part-time! My license is still New Jersey. I still vote in New Jersey. BON JOVI: See, I\u2019m the opposite. I can only put out an album. I do all I know how to do. I have to tell the complete story. It has to be the beginning, a middle and an end because that's who and what we are. BON JOVI: What comes through is joy. My goal with this record was to capture joy which for these last few years has been difficult, whether it\u2019s the dark cloud of COVID that the world experienced or my own personal journey. With this record, I think we captured joy.",

            "date": "2024-04-23 01:15:00",
            "content": "HAVANA -- His novels recount gruesome murders, thefts, scams, bribes and humiliating secrets. But those are not even the most important themes in the stories told by award-winning Cuba n writer Leonardo Padura. For the last four decades, Padura, 68, has managed to turn his series of detective thrillers into a social and political chronicle of Cuba, especially Havana, where he has lived all his life. The island he depicts in his books \u2014 which have been translated to dozens of languages \u2014 is a mix of economic deprivation, Afro-descendant syncretism, corruption, mischief, uplifting music and growing inequality \u2014 all seasoned by a revolution that marked the 20th century. \u201cI write about the problems of individuals in Cuban society. And often, in my books, more than dramatic conflicts between the characters, you will find a social conflict between the characters and their historical time,\u201d Padura told The Associated Press in a recent interview at his home in Mantilla, the populous Havana neighborhood where he was born, raised and married. The scent of freshly brewed coffee is in the air, as well as the chirping sound of the birds that inhabit the patio where his dogs are buried. In a nearby studio, his wife, screenwriter Luc\u00eda L\u00f3pez Coll, works on a computer. It's also in this house where Mario Conde, the principal character of Padura\u2019s work, was born. The downtrodden, nostalgic, chain-smoking detective has accompanied Padura since 1991, when \u201cPast Perfect\u201d \u2014 the first of the \u201cHavana Quartet\u201d series featuring Conde as the main protagonist \u2014 was published. Keeping track of Detective Conde is almost like taking the pulse of Cuba in the last few years. His last appearance was in the 2020 novel \u201cPersonas Decentes\u201d (\"Decent People\") in which, now over 60 years old, Conde gets involved in the investigation of a homicide \u2014 and corruption case \u2014 against the backdrop of the 2016 historic visit of former U.S. President Barack Obama and the Rolling Stones to the island. \u201cThis character comes from a neighborhood similar to mine,\u201d Padura says of Conde. \u201cHe is a man of my generation. ... His view of reality has evolved because I have evolved, and his feeling of disenchantment has a lot to do with the way we have been living all these years.\u201d Reflecting on Cuba\u2019s situation after the tightening of U.S. sanctions during the administration of President Donald Trump and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Padura says the island has barely crawled out of the crisis and has not yet been able to get back on its feet. He points at the lack of food and medications, rising prices and deteriorating health and education systems, while Cubans grapple with fuel shortages and constant blackouts. \u201cThere is a historical fatigue,\" he says. \"People are tired, they have no alternatives and they look for one by emigrating.\u201d The soft-spoken chronicler highlights yet another impact of Cuba's ongoing economic crisis: A wave of popular protests and demonstrations that had not been seen in decades. \u201cThe main cry was for food and electricity,\u201d Padura recalls about the protests in 2021 and, more recently, in March. \u201cBut people also screamed \u2018Freedom!' The lack of food and electricity might have been solved by fixing some thermoelectric plants and with a little rice and sugar ... but the other thing has not been talked about \u2014 and I think it's something that should be discussed in depth.\u201d Born in 1955, Leonardo de la Caridad Padura Fuentes studied literature at the University of Havana and worked as a journalist for state-owned media in the 1980s. He has won a number of important prizes, including the Hammett Prize, awarded by the International Association of Crime Writers, on two occasions (1998 and 2006); Cuba's National Prize for Literature In 2012, and the Princess of Asturias Award for literature in Spain in 2015. In 2016, Netflix released \u201cFour Seasons in Havana,\u201d a miniseries featuring detective Conde. Despite the international recognition, only a few of Padura's books have been published in Cuba, and when they do, only a few copies are printed. Also, because of his critical, sometimes dark view of the island, his work is barely promoted or mentioned in the official media. Unlike many writers and intellectuals who in recent years decided to leave Cuba, Padura \u2014 who travels extensively \u2014 is determined to stay. \u201cI have many reasons for living outside of Cuba but I think the ones that keep me here weigh more heavily. One of them is my sense of belonging,\" he says. \"I have a strong sense of belonging to a reality, to a culture, to a way of seeing life, to a way of expressing myself.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

            "date": "2024-04-22 16:28:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- They watched from the courtroom or via closed-circuit television in an overflow room \u2014 roughly 140 reporters, most with laptops or other silenced electronic devices, serving up news at its most elemental and in rapid-fire fashion. There were utterances posted a few seconds after they left a lawyer\u2019s mouth. Observations on how Donald Trump is reacting. Tidbits on what testimony is causing jurors to scribble notes. \u201cLet me give you some quotes to make you feel like you\u2019re inside the courtroom,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Yasmin Vossoughian said before reading the reports of colleagues. Trump's hush money trial is illustrating the potency of live blogs as a news tool \u2014 by necessity. Television and text journalism are normally two very different mediums. Yet because New York state rules forbid camera coverage of trials and the former president's case has such high interest, blogs are emerging as the best way to communicate for both formats. During opening arguments in the case on Monday, CNN used one-third of its television screen to display short printed updates of what was going on, written by its three journalists stationed at the Manhattan courthouse. MSNBC did something similar with onscreen \u201cchyrons\u201d \u2014 superimposed text. Traditional outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press use news blogs regularly, experience that proved helpful Monday. While such blogs often supplement traditional television coverage of big events like the Academy Awards or election nights \u2014 it's known as a \u201csecond-screen\u201d experience \u2014 this time consumers had no other option. Some 140 reporters watched from the courtroom or via closed-circuit television in an overflow room, feeding news to editors. They're watched carefully themselves: Two reporters covering the trial were expelled on Monday for breaking rules prohibiting recording and photography in the overflow room, where reporters who can't get into the courtroom watch the proceedings on large screens, according to court officials. Blog dispatches sometimes felt like bits and pieces of a print story in development, like this from The Washington Post's Devlin Barrett: \u201cThey disguised what the payments were,\u201d (prosecutor Matthew) Colangelo said, speaking clearly and calmly with his hands in his suit pockets.\" Others try to set the scene: \u201cAll 18 jurors are looking directly at the veteran prosecutor, who stands at a lectern in the middle of the courtroom about halfway between them and Trump,\u201d wrote AP's Michael R. Sisak. The New York Post 's Kyle Schnitzer wrote that Trump attorney Todd Blanche wrapped up his opening statement with a hometown appeal, quoting him in saying, \u201cuse your common sense, you're New Yorkers, that's why we are here.\u201d Other observances are more analytical or seek to correct the record. The Post's Shayna Jacobs wrote that \u201cin opening statements, prosecutors focused heavily on the circumstantial evidence that they argue will help prove that Donald Trump paid off Stormy Daniels in 2016 to keep her from going public about an alleged encounter with Trump a decade before.\u201d The Times' Maggie Haberman wrote as Trump's attorney was delivering his opening statement that \"Blanche is trying to portray the the National Enquirer's practices as similar to how other news outlets operate, in terms of deciding when and how to publish a story. That is not correct.\u201d For CNN and MSNBC, which covered opening arguments more extensively Monday than Trump-friendly outlets Fox News Channel and Newsmax, there were some growing pains in getting used to the new form of storytelling. MSNBC used text less frequently, occasionally relying on the awkwardness of correspondents trying to search through notes for the latest quotes. \u201cTrump lawyer: Trump is not on the hook for what Cohen did,\u201d read one MSNBC chyron. \u201cTrump lawyer: Nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,\u201d read another. A handful of times, CNN's Jake Tapper interrupted speakers to read blog dispatches that viewers were also able to see for themselves on their screens. Still, the blog-like reports were often more helpful than on-screen analysts, particularly when they tried to predict what would take place next. One MSNBC pundit confidently predicted that Judge Juan Merchan would end the day's proceedings before a first witness was called and a CNN analyst said that first witness would wrap his testimony with a juicy revelation. Neither happened. ___ David Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press. Follow him at http://twitter.com/dbauder.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON -- Actor Ashley Judd and singer-songwriter Aloe Blacc, who both lost loved ones to suicide, on Tuesday helped the Biden administration promote its new national strategy to prevent suicide. Judd's mother, country star Naomi Judd, died nearly two years ago. Blacc's frequent collaborator, Tim Bergling, died in 2018. Both were on hand as Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, helped unveil the Democratic administration's blueprint for reducing suicides in the United States. Some 132 people a day kill themselves, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here today because we know that we can and will change this,\u201d Emhoff said. \u201cSuicide is preventable.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014 EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide.

Judd said she also has suffered from depression and has had a different outcome because of treatment. \u201cI carry a message of hope,\u201d she said. Asked what people can do to help someone in crisis, Rowe said people shouldn't worry about \u201cif you're saying the right thing. Just say something and show up.\u201d Blacc suggested that people offer a \u201cmoment of joy\u201d when they do reach out, such as a memory that sparks laughter or a song. He also encouraged people to remember that they are \u201cthe light.\u201d \u201cThere's no such thing as too much love.

            "content": "NEW YORK -- The baseball players' association asked a federal court to confirm an arbitrator's decision denying an attempt by a baseball agent at Bad Bunny\u2019s Rimas Sports firm to block the agent's decertification by the union. In a complaint filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the Major League Baseball Players Association asked that a federal judge issue an order to confirm what the union said was a decision by arbitrator Michael Gottesman to deny a request for a temporary restraining order requested by William Arroyo of Rimas Sports and Noah Assad and Jonathan Miranda, two executives of the company. The union said it issued a notice of discipline to the three on April 10 and fined them $400,000 for misconduct. Arroyo was an agent certified by the union to represent players and represented New York Mets catcher Francisco Alvarez and infielder Ronny Mauricio. Assad and Miranda had applied for certification, the union said. \u201cAfter detailing extensive, serious violations of the MLBPA regulations, including those prohibiting inducements and unlawful recruiters and requiring cooperation with MLBPA investigations, the MLBPA revoked Mr. Arroyo\u2019s certification and denied certification to applicants Messrs. Assad and Miranda,\" the union said. The union said it agreed to let Gottesman hear the application by the three for a temporary restraining order. Represented by lawyer Jeffrey Kessler, the union did not appear to file a copy of Gottesman's decision with its complaint, which was first reported by ESPN. Bad Bunny is one of the top-selling artists in the world whose real name is Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio. The three-time Grammy winner launched Rimas Sports in April of 2023.

            "date": "2024-04-22 12:18:00",
            "content": "The venerable Neil Young offers a ragged and raw live take of his beloved 1990 album \u201cRagged Glory\u201d with a new album, titled \u201cFu##in\u2019 Up.\u201d Of course, the 2024 version doesn't have the same semi-youthful energy that the 44-year-old Young put into the original. Maybe his voice is a little shakier, the guitar solos not quite as refined, but the songs still crackle with a power that's frankly stunning coming from the not-so-young Young. It's clear that the 78-year-old and his band Crazy Horse fed off the small crowd at the Toronto club where this was recorded in November 2023. Young is obviously having a blast on stage, so much so that he decided to release the songs just months after the performance. This is from a guy who has held on to some of his most beloved live shows for half a century. Young and Crazy Horse perform nine of the 10 \u201cRagged Glory\u201d songs in nearly identical arrangements to how they were recorded back in 1990. Only one song from the original release, \u201cMother Earth (Natural Anthem),\u201d is absent on \u201dFu##in\u2019 Up.\u201d The songs have all been retitled with lyrics from the original, except for the cover of \u201cFarmer John.\u201d For example, \u201cOver and Over\u201d becomes \u201cBroken Circle\u201d and \u201cLove to Burn\u201d becomes \u201cValley of Hearts.\u201d The somewhat profane album title is more or less the same as a song from \u201cRagged Glory,\u201d just with a couple of different characters in between the \u201cf\u201d and the \u201cin.\u201d (It went from \u201cF(asterisk)!#in\u2019 Up\u201d in 1990 to \u201cFu##kin\u2019 Up\u201d in 2024.) For all of its virtues, some fans of the original may quibble with Young tackling the material 34 years later, especially since he doesn't differ much from the originals. \u201cNot everyone will want to hear it because it\u2019s not for everyone,\" Young writes in the liner notes. \"In the spirit it\u2019s offered, we made this for the Horse lovers. I can\u2019t stop it. The Horse is runnin' \u2014 what a ride we have. I don\u2019t want to mess with the vibe, and I am so happy to have this to share.\u201d It may be for a niche Neil audience, but that niche is sure to love it. And Young probably doesn't care what the rest think.",

            "date": "2024-04-23 01:37:00",
            "content": "LONDON -- It\u2019s springtime in Europe \u2014 time for the annual blossoming of spectacle and sound known as the Eurovision Song Contest. Taking place in May in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, the 68th annual competition will see acts from 37 countries vie for the continent\u2019s pop crown in a feelgood extravaganza that strives \u2014 not always successfully \u2013 to banish international strife and division. And you don\u2019t have to be in Europe to watch, or to help pick the winner. Here\u2019s a guide to all things Eurovision. On one level, it\u2019s simple: Eurovision is an international pop music competition in which acts from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete in a live televised contest to be crowned Eurovision champion. But it\u2019s also much more -- a celebration of diversity, national pride and the joyous power of pop. And glitter. So much glitter. Launched in 1956 to foster unity after World War II, Eurovision has become a campy, feel-good celebration of pop music with an audience of hundreds of millions around the world. It has grown from seven countries to almost 40, including non-European nations such as Israel and Australia. It\u2019s now known for songs that range from anthemic to extremely silly, often with elaborate costumes and spectacular staging. Paul Jordan, an expert on the contest who is known as \u201cDr. Eurovision,\u201d said the contest \u201cis almost indescribable in terms of its scale, in terms of its craziness \u2014 but I would liken it to probably the musical version of the Olympic Games.\u201d This year\u2019s contest will be held in Malm\u00f6 in southern Sweden, with two semifinals on May 7 and 9 followed by a grand final on May 11. Traditionally the competition is hosted by the previous year\u2019s winner, and Sweden triumphed in 2023 with \u201cTattoo,\u201d a power ballad by pop diva Loreen. The Nordic nation is a Eurovision powerhouse that has won the contest seven times, a number equaled only by Ireland. This year marks the 50th anniversary of a Eurovision\u2019s most iconic moment, ABBA\u2019s victory in the 1974 contest with \u201cWaterloo.\u201d The win propelled the band toward superstardom and helped jump-start Sweden\u2019s music industry. Fans are hoping for an appearance by the Swedish supergroup in Malm\u00f6, though the band members have played down those suggestions. Eurovision\u2019s motto is \u201cunited by music\u201d and organizer the European Broadcasting Union strives to keep political divisions out of the competition, though it doesn\u2019t always succeed. Russia has been banned since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine . Last year\u2019s contest was held in the English city of Liverpool because the 2022 winner, Ukraine, was at war. This year, pro-Palestinian activists and some musicians have urged organizers to drop Israel from the event over its conduct in its war against Hamas, which has killed more than 33,000 people in Gaza, according to its Health Ministry. Israel has not been suspended, but it was ordered to change the lyrics of its competing song, originally titled \u201cOctober Rain,\u201d an apparent reference to Hamas\u2019 cross-border Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis. Renamed \u201cHurricane,\u201d the power ballad will be performed by 20-year-old singer Eden Golan. With feelings running high, organizers issued a statement saying they \u201cfirmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.\u201d Jordan said Eurovision organizers have sometimes been accused of inconsistency in setting the contest\u2019s boundaries. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed political entries \u2026and yet Finland 2013 has a song about equal marriage,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had other songs about world peace -- technically they\u2019re political too. So what is the division between politics and non-politics is quite a blurred line.\u201d Pro-Palestinian groups plan demonstrations in downtown Malmo during Eurovision week that they hope will draw thousands of protesters from Sweden and neighboring countries. Malm\u00f6 district police chief Petra Stenkula said security would be \u201crigorous,\u201d with Swedish police reinforced by officers from Denmark and Norway. Eurovision\u2019s complex voting system, which awards points from juries of music industry professionals as well as viewers across Europe, makes winners notoriously hard to predict. Jordan said there used to be a \u201ctypical\u201d Eurovision sound -\u2013 a three-minute pop song in English with a key change \u2014 but the contest is now much more diverse. Many acts perform in their national languages and some draw on folk traditions and instruments, though slick production and electro beats still predominate. Winners have ranged from Canadian chanteuse Celine Dion , who competed for Switzerland in 1988, to fright mask-wearing Finnish metalheads Lordi in 2006, bearded Austrian drag performer Conchita Wurst in 2014, Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin in 2021 and Ukrainian folk-rap group Kalush Orchestra in 2022. Bookmakers\u2019 favorites this year include nonbinary Swiss singer Nemo\u2019s powerhouse song \u201cThe Code\u201d and Croatian singer-songwriter Baby Lasagna\u2019s earwormy electro number \u201cRim Tim Tagi Dim.\u201d Other entries to watch include the Netherlands\u2019 Joost Klein with pop-rap song \u201cEuropapa,\u201d \u201cLa Noia\u201c by Italian TikTok star Angelina Mango and \u201cTeresa & Maria\u201d by the Ukrainian duo of rapper alyona alyona and vlogger Jerry Heil. Spain\u2019s entry, \u201c Zorra\u201d by the duo Nebulossa, has drawn controversy because its title can be translated as an anti-female slur. The U.K., which has not won since 1997, is pinning its hopes on Olly Alexander\u2019s vertiginous pop song \u201cDizzy.\u201d Host country Sweden is represented by identical twins Marcus & Martinus -\u2013 who, confusingly enough, hail from Norway -- with the confidently titled \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d Eurovision voters will be the judge of that. The competition will be aired by national broadcasters in participating nations, on streaming service Peacock in the United States and on the Eurovision YouTube channel. Viewers in the U.S. and other nonparticipating countries can vote online or using the Eurovision app; viewers in participating countries can also vote by phone or text message.",

Podolak played quarterback and running back for the Hawkeyes before he became a fixture at running back for the Kansas City Chiefs from 1969-77. He was a color commentator for NBC and ESPN before he joined the Iowa radio team in 1982. He worked nearly 500 games alongside play-by-play men Jim Zabel and Gary Dolphin. \u201cI have said it often across 27 years that Ed Podolak is the best I\u2019ve ever worked with in the broadcast booth,\u201d Dolphin said. \u201cOne of the game\u2019s great competitors, Ed\u2019s ability to explain plays was unparalleled.

Sharing my perspective for the incredible Hawkeye fans from coast to coast has been a thrill.\" Podolak was named first-team All-Big Ten and team MVP in 1968, when he set a then-conference record with 286 yards on 17 rushing attempts against Northwestern.

            "date": "2024-04-22 11:30:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- The ambiguity of Imagine Dragons' next album starts from the cover. Two figures stand in the distance separated by a dawning sun. Or is it setting? Lead singer and songwriter Dan Reynolds, who dreamed it up, sees it both ways. \u201cYou can\u2019t really tell if it\u2019s a sunset or a sunrise, and then there are two people kind of separated standing in front of it. That really kind of sums it up thematically when I listen to it,\" he tells The Associated Press. \u201cIs the beginning of something new, or is this the end of something? And the sunset and the sunrise always kind of feels that way to me. It could be either/or.\u201d From the paranoid, slightly demented hip-hop-rock opening song \u201cWake Up\u201d \u2014 with Reynolds singing: \u201cEverybody\u2019s coming for you/Wake up!\u201d \u2014 to the strummy, swaying \u201cTake Me to the Beach,\u201d it\u2019s clear the nine-track album called \u201cLoom\u201d isn\u2019t one thing. The album comes out June 28. It's the first album since Reynolds\u2019 divorce from musician Aja Volkman and there are songs about moving on \u2014 the sunny flirtatious \u201cNice to Meet Ya\u201d \u2014 but also looking behind, like the bittersweet \u201cIn Your Corner\u201d \u2014 \u201cYou turned your back/And now we\u2019re here\u201d \u2014 and \u201cDon\u2019t Forget Me,\u201d with the lyrics \u201cGuess we got lost in the light.\u201d \u201cI just start creating and whatever comes out is what it is. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been since I was 12. I try not to overthink it,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cIt\u2019s just an honest output sonically, lyrically of how I\u2019m feeling in the moment.\u201d For the driving, anthemic \u201cKid,\u201d Reynolds says he came into the studio with his life a little chaotic. He just spoke words that he was feeling over a drum loop: \u201cYou got to get yourself together, kid/You got to get it together.\u201d Then the band started building. The song, inspired by the \u201990s music he loves, like by Gorillaz, became an exhortation for America, so adding a choir made sense. \u201cWe had a lot of fun creating that one in the studio. I love the juxtaposition of things that are kind of tongue-in-cheek, but also maybe dark,\u201d he says. \u201cHeavy concepts, but playful at the same time.\u201d \u201cLoom\u201d was recorded in a new way for Imagine Dragons, which includes guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee and drummer Daniel Platzman. For one thing, the band abandoned their usual preference for multiple producers in favor of just one \u2014 the Swedish duo of Mattman & Robin. Another change was approaching it fresh. \u201cWe usually go into the record having a bunch of demos that we\u2019ve already just self-produced and done on our own,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cBut this one we had a bunch of demos and we just scrapped everything and went in with a clean slate.\u201d \u201cLoom\u201d comes two years after \u201cMercury,\u201d a brooding, raw confessional double album that dealt with heartache, tragedy and Reynolds' struggles with sobriety. \"Eyes Closed,\" the new album's first single, signals a change, with a big stormy banger and the chest-pounding lyrics: \u201cI\u2019m back from the dead, from the back of my head/Been gone and facin\u2019 horrors that should never be said.\u201d Reynolds says he was going for a blustery, arrogant vibe but revealing a vulnerable core. \u201cIt really was about being something that on the outside looks put together and strong,\u201d he says, \u201cbut on the inside it\u2019s on the verge of maybe shattering.\u201d The title of the album \u2014 \u201cLoom\u201d \u2014 has multiple meanings. \u201cJust because something is looming doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s bad. It could be good,\u201d he says. \u201cI also love the idea of the double meaning of it, kind of being a tapestry.\u201d The Dragons will tour across North America in support of \u201cLoom,\u201d kicking off June 30 in Camden, New Jersey, at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion and hitting such cities at Dallas, Seattle; Toronto; West Palm Beach, Florida; Denver; Charlotte, North Carolina; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; and concluding on Oct. 22 at the Hollywood Bowl. Reynolds says touring is deep within Imagine Dragons' DNA and speaks about playing live as if it were a massive therapeutic effort, which their shows often become. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of people in a room together realizing they\u2019re not alone in their their feelings,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily need them to feel happy or sad or anything. I just want them to look around them and see that other people are also feeling something and feeling, \u2018I\u2019m not alone in that.\u2019\u201d Songs from \u201cLoom\u201d will make the setlist, of course. Reynolds considers it one of the band's most up-tempo collections, even though there are ballads and slow moments. \u201cA lot of the record is kind trying to come to terms with just accepting. Things are looming and incoming, for better or for worse, and there's just really nothing you could do other than accept it,\u201d he says. \u201cI still haven\u2019t learned to do that, but we will.\u201d ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",

            "content": "In his final letter to his wife before he vanished on Mount Everest a century ago , George Mallory tried to ease her worries even as he said his chances of reaching the world's highest peak were \u201c50 to 1 against us.\" The letter, digitized for the first time and published online Monday by his Cambridge University alma mater, expressed a mix of optimism, exhaustion and the difficulties his expedition encountered on their quest to be the first party to conquer the peak. \u201cDarling I wish you the best I can \u2014 that your anxiety will be at an end before you get this \u2014 with the best news,\" he wrote to Ruth Mallory on May 27, 1924 from Camp I. \u201cIt is 50 to 1 against us but we\u2019ll have a whack yet & do ourselves proud.\u201d It remains a mystery whether Mallory, who once famously said he wanted to conquer Everest \u201cbecause it\u2019s there,\u201d and climbing partner Andrew Irvine reached the summit and died on the way down or never made it that far. Mallory\u2019s body was found 75 years later far below the peak, but Irvine's has never been located. The first documented ascent came nearly three decades later when New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay scaled the mountain on May 29, 1953. Magdalene College posted the letters online to mark the centenary of Mallory's ill-fated attempt to stand atop the world. The collection, which had previously been available to researchers, also includes letters he wrote from the battlefront in World War I and correspondence he received from others, including his wife. The only surviving letter his wife wrote from England during the expedition was sent as his party sailed toward Bombay. It recounts a recent snowstorm, how her bank account was overdrawn and how she fell off a ladder before telling him how much she missed him. \u201cI know I have rather often been cross and not nice and I am very sorry but the bottom reason has nearly always been because I was unhappy at getting so little of you,\" Ruth Mallory wrote on March 3, 1924. \u201cI know it is pretty stupid to spoil the times I do have you for those when I don\u2019t.\u201d In his final six-page correspondence to his wife, addressed to \u201cMy dearest Ruth,\" George Mallory speaks of trials and triumphs as the party slowly made its way up the mountain, setting up higher camps and then retreating to lower elevation to recover. \u201cThis has been a bad time altogether,\u201d Mallory wrote 12 days before he was last seen alive. \u201cI look back on tremendous efforts & exhaustion & dismal looking out of a tent door and onto a world of snow & vanishing hopes \u2014 & yet, & yet, & yet there have been a good many things to set on the other side.\u201d Mallory said he had a nagging cough \u201cfit to tear one\u2019s guts\u201d that left him sleepless and made climbing difficult. He described a near-death plunge into a crevasse when he failed to detect it beneath a blanket of snow. \u201cIn I went with the snow tumbling all around me, down luckily only about 10 feet before I fetched up half-blind & breathless to find myself most precariously supported only by my ice ax somehow caught across the crevasse & still held in my right hand,\u201d he said. \u201cBelow was a very unpleasant black hole.\u201d Mallory said only one member of the party remained \u201cplum fit\u201d and they planned to rest up for two days before pushing for the summit, which was expected to take six days. Mallory and Irvine were last seen alive June 8, 1924 when they were said to be still going strong some 900 feet (274 meters) beneath the 29,035 feet (8,850 meters) summit. Mallory\u2019s body was found at 26,700 feet (8,138 meters). A group of mountaineers who tried in 2007 to reconstruct Mallory's ascent were unable to determine if the pair made it to the top. \u201cI still believe the possibility is there they made it to the top, but it is very unlikely,\u201d said Conrad Anker, who participated in a documentary recreating the climb and who had discovered Mallory's body in 1999. In Mallory's final letter to his wife, he says, \u201cthe candle is burning out & I must stop.\u201d He signs off: \u201cGreat love to you. Ever your loving, George.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-22 11:45:00",
            "content": "MIAMI -- A leading fashion designer whose accessories were used by celebrities from Britney Spears to the cast of the \u201cSex and the City\u201d TV series was sentenced Monday to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty in Miami federal court on charges of smuggling crocodile handbags from her native Colombia. Nancy Gonzalez was arrested in 2022 in Cali, Colombia, and later extradited to the U.S. for running a sprawling multiyear conspiracy that involved recruiting couriers to transport her handbags on commercial flights to high-end showrooms and New York fashion events \u2014 all in violation of U.S. wildlife laws. \u201cIt\u2019s all driven by the money,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Watts-Fitzgerald, who compared Gonzalez\u2019s behavior to that of drug traffickers. \u201cIf you want to deter the conduct, you want the cocaine kingpin, not the person in the field.\u201d Lawyers for Gonzalez sought leniency for the celebrity designer, describing her journey as a divorced single mother of two children who designed belts on a home sewing machine in Cali for friends into a fashion icon who outcompeted the likes of Dior, Prada and Gucci. \u201cShe was determined to show her children and the world that women, including minority women like herself, can pursue their dreams successfully, and become financially independent,\u201d they wrote in a memo prior to Monday\u2019s hearing. \u201cAgainst all odds, this tiny but mighty woman was able to create the very first luxury, high-end fashion company from a third world country.\u201d The attorneys said the 71-year-old designer has already paid dearly for her crimes. The Colombian company she built, which once employed 300 mostly female employees, declared bankruptcy and stopped operating after her arrest. They also argued that only 1% of the merchandise she imported into the U.S. lacked proper authorization and were samples for New York Fashion week and other events. Gonzalez, addressing the court before sentencing, said she deeply regretted not meticulously complying with U.S. laws and that her only wish is to hug once more her 103-year-old mother. \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, I apologize to the United States of America. I never intended to offend a country to which I owe immense gratitude,\u201d she said holding back tears. \u201cUnder pressure, I made poor decisions.\u201d Prosecutors countered that Gonzalez had acquired great wealth and an opulent lifestyle, which contrasted with the couriers she recruited to smuggle her merchandise into the United States. The couriers were instructed to say that the items were gifts for their relatives if they were asked any questions by customs agents. \u201cHer mission turned into producing felons,\u201d said Watts-Fitzgerald. \"She tried to rewrite the law for herself, to do it her way.\" According to the testimony of her co-defendants and former employees, ahead of important fashion events, Gonzalez, described as a micro-manager, would recruit as many as 40 passengers to carry four designer handbags each on commercial flights. In this way, prosecutors estimate that she smuggled goods that fetched as much as $2 million in the U.S. Gonzalez's attorneys disputed the claim and said each skin cost only around $140. All of the hides were from caiman and pythons bred in captivity. Nonetheless, on some occasions she failed to obtain the proper import authorizations from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, required under a widely ratified international treaty governing the trade in endangered and threatened wildlife species. In 2016 and 2017, she was warned by U.S. officials against sidestepping such rules, making her conduct particularly \u201cegregious,\u201d Judge Robert Scola said in handing down his sentence. Prosecutors had been seeking a stiffer sentence of 30 to 37 months. But Scola said he was taking into account the nearly 14 months she spent in harsher conditions in a Colombian prison awaiting extradition. Gonzalez, who has been free on a bond under confinement at her daughter's home in Miami, must surrender June 6 to begin her sentence. Although trade in the skins used by Gonzalez was not prohibited, they came from protected wildlife that requires close monitoring under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known by its initials as CITES. Salma Hayek, Britney Spears and Victoria Beckham are among celebrities who bought Gonzalez's carefully crafted handbags. Her work also was included in a 2008 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Gonzalez's attorneys showed in court a video, from 2019, of top buyers from Bergdorf Goodman, Saks and others praising the designer\u2019s creativity, productivity and humanity \u2014 comments prosecutor Watts-Fitzgerald said the retailers likely regret today. \u201cThey must be regretting they were ever put up to that and if they heard it was presented in court they would cringe,\" said Watts-Fitzgerald. \"They have their own brand to protect.\u201d",

            "content": "\u201cFunny Story\u201d isn\u2019t a funny story at all. But it is a good one. Emily Henry's new romance novel starts with dueling breakups that have rocked the two main characters\u2019 worlds \u2014 and forced them to bond over their shared broken hearts. Daphne is a planner who is always on time. She\u2019s a buttoned-up librarian who hosts a lively children\u2019s reading hour and keeps her personal life closed off from her colleagues. Miles is more subdued. He\u2019s nice, thoughtful and able to win over anyone he\u2019s talking to, especially the regulars he sees on his weekend trips to the farmers market. He doesn\u2019t have much of a relationship with his parents, for myriad reasons, but he\u2019s very close to his younger sister. Daphne and Miles\u2019 story starts as they navigate their newly single lives now that their exes are dating ... each other. They go through the throes of grieving together, with a soundtrack of love songs accompanying each phase. It's practically begging for a movie version, to go along with the several other Henry books already in various stages of production. Early on, they decide to pretend they\u2019re dating to make their exes jealous. But as time goes on, they discover that they see each other as more than friends, that they really are falling for each other. \u201cFunny Story\u201d is Henry\u2019s latest romance \u2014 and her steamiest one so far. It\u2019s a mixture of will-they-won\u2019t-they in a way that makes you really want them to. They\u2019re the protagonists in separate love stories who are brought together by heartbreak. Daphne and Miles are characters you can empathize with and root for. And \u201cFunny Story\u201d is classic Henry. It\u2019s a meet-cute in a non-patronizing way. It\u2019s a modern love story, and one that you won\u2019t be mad is slightly predictable \u2014 because it makes you feel good and makes you believe in a thing called love. \u201cSo many of the most beautiful things in life are unexpected,\u201d Henry writes. It\u2019s funny how life and love are both that way. ___ AP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews",

            "date": "2024-04-22 00:17:00",
            "content": "LAS VEGAS -- A $12 billion passenger bullet train linking Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area was dubbed the first true high-speed rail line in the nation on Monday, with the private company building it predicting millions of ticket-buyers will be boarding trains by 2028. \u201cPeople have been dreaming of high-speed rail in America for decades,\u201d said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg before taking a stage with union representatives and company officials at the future site of a terminal to be built just south of the Las Vegas Strip. \u201cIt\u2019s really happening this time.\" Buttigieg cited Biden administration support for the project that he said will bring thousands of union jobs, boost local economies and cut traffic and air pollution. Brightline West, whose sister company already operates a fast train between Miami and Orlando in Florida, aims to lay 218 miles (351 kilometers) of new track almost all in the median of Interstate 15 between Las Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga, California. It would link there with a commuter rail connection to downtown Los Angeles. A station also is planned in San Bernardino County\u2019s Victorville area. Company officials say the goal is to have trains exceeding speeds of 186 mph (300 kph) \u2014 comparable to Japan\u2019s Shinkansen bullet trains \u2014 operating in time for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. \u201cI believe we\u2019ll look back at today and say, \u2019This was the birth of an industry of high-speed rail,'\u201d Brightline Holdings founder Wes Edens said Monday. The company aims to link U.S. cities that are too near each other for air travel to make sense and too far for people to drive. Las Vegas has no Amtrak service. The idea of a bullet train to Los Angeles dates back decades under various names including DesertXpress. Brightline West acquired the project in 2019, and company and public officials say it has all required right-of-way and environmental approvals, along with labor agreements. Brightline received Biden administration backing including a $3 billion grant from federal infrastructure funds and recent approval to sell another $2.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds. The company won federal authorization in 2020 to sell $1 billion in similar bonds. Brightline West says electric-powered trains will cut the four-hour trip across the Mojave Desert to a little more than two hours. It projects 11 million one-way passengers per year, with fares that Edens said will be comparable to airline ticket costs. The trains will offer rest rooms, Wi-Fi, food and beverage sales and the option to check luggage. Officials hope the train line will relieve congestion on I-15, where drivers often sit in miles of crawling traffic while returning home to Southern California from a Las Vegas weekend. An average of more than 44,000 automobiles per day crossed the California-Nevada state line on I-15 in 2023, according to Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority data. Florida-based Brightline Holdings' Miami-line debuted in 2018 and expanded service to Orlando International Airport last September with trains reaching speeds up to 125 mph (200 kph). It offers 16 round-trips per day with one-way tickets for the 235-mile (378-kilometer) distance costing about $80. Other fast trains in the U.S. include Amtrak\u2019s Acela, which can top 150 mph (241 kph) between Boston and Washington, D.C. But fast train connections for other U.S. cities have been floated, including Dallas to Houston; Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago to St. Louis; and Seattle to Portland, Oregon. Most have faced delays. In California, a proposed 500-mile (805-kilometer) rail line linking Los Angeles and San Francisco was approved by voters in 2008, but has been beset by rising costs and routing disputes. A 2022 business plan by the California High-Speed Rail Authority projected the cost had more than tripled to $105 billion.",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- True love's kiss or an invite to the Met Gala? Those in the rarified ranks of international celebrity \u2014 and Anna Wintour's good graces \u2014 need not choose. Stars of film, fashion, music, sports, politics and social media will ascend the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the first Monday in May \u2014 May 6, that is \u2014 to sip cocktails, have dinner and sample the new exhibit, \u201cSleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" As fashion's biggest night approaches, it's time for The Associated Press to issue the 2024 version of our annual guide. It started in 1948 as a society midnight supper, and wasn\u2019t even at the Met. Fast forward 70-plus years, and it's one of the most photographed events in the world, renowned for its head-spinning red carpet \u2014 though the carpet isn\u2019t always red. It\u2019s important to note, though, that the party has a purpose, raising money for the Met\u2019s Costume Institute \u2014 nearly $22 million last year, a record for the self-funding department \u2014 and launching the annual spring exhibit that brings hundreds of thousands of visitors to the museum. But it\u2019s the carpet itself that draws the world\u2019s eyes, with the 400-strong guest list the subject of rabid speculation until the last minute \u2014 a collection of luminaries that arguably makes for the highest celebrity wattage-per-square-foot of any party in the world. \u201cAnna Wintour Me Pregunt\u00f3,\u201d Bad Bunny could sing. Multi-hyphenate Jennifer Lopez adds yet another role to her busy year. And then there are two Marvel stars who have been spending a lot of time in the desert lately: Zendaya, who has continued to stun on red carpets with her \u201cDune\u201d and \u201cChallengers\u201d looks, and Chris Hemsworth, who is trading in Mjolnir for the upcoming \u201cFuriosa.\u201d (Hemsworth is, in fact, a first-time gala attendee. ) And, of course, Wintour herself. The theme revolves around \u201csleeping beauties,\u201d but has little to do with fairytales. \u201cSleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" the title of the accompanying exhibit, refers to garments from the Costume Institute's collection that have been \u201cin slumber\u201d and now will be on display, some too fragile to hang upright lest they disintegrate. Curator Andrew Bolton picked 250 pieces spanning four centuries. The theme is accompanied by a dress code \u2014 this year, it's \u201cThe Garden of Time.\u201d The theme and dress code are often interpreted ... loosely. So there's a chance you may see an Aurora on the carpet, after all. Wrong question. You cannot just buy a ticket. The right question is: If I were famous or powerful and got invited, how much would it cost? Well, you might not pay yourself. Generally companies buy tables. A fashion label would then host its desired celebrities. Tickets have in the past cost $50,000 for an individual, and $300,000 or more for a table. You can watch the whole carpet unfold on a Vogue livestream. If you\u2019re in New York, you can also join fans across the street, behind barricades, on Fifth Avenue or even further east on Madison. And the AP will have a livestream of departures from the Mark Hotel, where many gala guests get ready. Entering the museum, guests walk past what is usually an impossibly enormous flower arrangement in the lobby, with perhaps an orchestra playing nearby, and over to cocktails. Or, they head to view the exhibit. Cocktails are about 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., followed by dinner, but the most famous \u2014 or those who plan to make the biggest entrance \u2014 sometimes come (fashionably) later.",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- One of the country's leading artist residency programs, MacDowell, has awarded a lifetime achievement prize to Yoko Ono. The groundbreaking artist, filmmaker and musician is this year's recipient of the Edward MacDowell Medal, an honor previously given to Stephen Sondheim and Toni Morrison among others. \u201cThere has never been anyone like her; there has never been work like hers,\u201d MacDowell board chair Nell Painter said in a statement Sunday. \"Over some seven decades, she has rewarded eyes, provoked thought, inspired feminists, and defended migrants through works of a wide-ranging imagination. Enduringly fresh and pertinent, her uniquely powerful oeuvre speaks to our own times, so sorely needful of her leitmotif: Peace.\u201d Ono's son, Sean Ono Lennon, said in a statement that the medal was \u201can incredible honor.\u201d \u201cThe history and list of past recipients is truly remarkable. It makes me very proud to see her art appreciated and celebrated in this way,\" he said. Ono, 91, has made few public appearances in recent years and is not expected to attend the July awards ceremony, at the MacDowell campus in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Ono's music manager, David Newgarden, will accept the award on her behalf. Ono first became known as part of the avant-garde Fluxus movement of the 1960s, then reached international fame after meeting John Lennon, to whom she was married from 1969 until his death, in 1980. Their many collaborations included the songs \u201cGive Peace a Chance,\u201d \u201cImagine\u201d and \u201cHappy Xmas (War Is Over),\" the basis for \u201cWar Is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko,\u201d this year's winner of the Oscar for best animated short film. Over the past 40 years, Ono has had a busy career as a visual and recording artist, her albums including \u201cSeason of Glass,\u201d \u201cStarpeace\u201d and \u201cTake Me to the Land of Hell.\u201d She was recently the subject of a career retrospective at London's Tate Modern.",

Blige, Cher, Foreigner, A Tribe Called Quest, Kool & The Gang and Ozzy Osbourne have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame , a class that also includes folk-rockers Dave Matthews Band and singer-guitarist Peter Frampton . Alexis Korner, John Mayall and Big Mama Thornton earned the Musical Influence Award, while the late Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick and Norman Whitfield will get the Musical Excellence Award. Pioneering music executive Suzanne de Passe won the Ahmet Ertegun Award. \u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 roll is an ever-evolving amalgam of sounds that impacts culture and moves generations,\u201d John Sykes, chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, said in a statement. \u201cThis diverse group of inductees each broke down musical barriers and influenced countless artists that followed in their footsteps.\u201d The induction ceremony will be held Oct. 19 at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in Cleveland, Ohio. It will stream live on Disney+ with an airing on ABC at a later date and available on Hulu the next day. Those music acts nominated this year but didn't make the cut included Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz, the late Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor , soul-pop singer Sade, Britpoppers Oasis, hip-hop duo Eric B. & Rakim and alt-rockers Jane\u2019s Addiction. There had been a starry push to get Foreigner \u2014 with the hits \u201cUrgent\u201d and \"Hot Blooded\" \u2014 into the hall, with Mark Ronson, Jack Black, Slash, Dave Grohl and Paul McCartney all publicly backing the move. Ronson's stepfather is Mick Jones, Foreigner's founding member, songwriter and lead guitarist. Osbourne, who led many parents in the 1980s to clutch their pearls with his devil imagery and sludgy music, goes in as a solo artist, having already been inducted into the hall with metal masters Black Sabbath. Four of the eight nominees \u2014 Cher, Foreigner, Frampton and Kool & the Gang \u2014 were on the ballot for the first time. Cher \u2014 the only artist to have a No. 1 song in each of the past six decades \u2014 and Blige, with eight multi-platinum albums and nine Grammy Awards, will help boost the number of women in the hall, which critics say is too low. Artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they\u2019re eligible for induction. Nominees were voted on by more than 1,000 artists, historians and music industry professionals. Fans voted online or in person at the museum, with the top five artists picked by the public making up a \u201cfans\u2019 ballot\u201d that was tallied with the other professional ballots. Last year, Missy Elliott, Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Chaka Khan, \u201cSoul Train\u201d creator Don Cornelius, Kate Bush and the late George Michael were some of the artists who got into the hall . ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",

            "content": "PAYSON, Utah -- Actor Kevin Bacon on Saturday returned to the Utah high school where the cult classic movie \u201cFootloose\u201d was filmed more than 40 years. Bacon danced his way to a stage on a Payson High School athletic field Saturday to greet students before what likely was the final prom held at the school, which is set to be torn down next spring. \u201cYou talked me into it,\" Bacon said, according to video posted by Salt Lake City's ABC 4. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that kind of commitment to anything. I also think that it\u2019s amazing to see the power that this movie has had to bring people together.\u201d Bacon starred in \u201cFootloose\u201d as a Chicago teen who moved to a small town and fought its ban on dancing. Payson High School students ended Saturday with a \u201cFootloose\u201d-themed prom, just as the movie ended. About 21,000 people live in Payson, which is about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City. Principal Jesse Sorenson said students for years have tried to persuade Bacon to visit. What started as lighthearted appeals on social media turned into a community wide campaign to partner with Bacon's charity, Sorenson said. Students agreed to help put together 5,000 care packages for the charity, SixDegrees, to convince Bacon to visit. Students for weeks wrote hopeful messages for the eventual owners of each of the care packages and worked with the Utah Film Commission and SixDegrees to raise money and donations of toiletries, clothing and other items to go in the backpacks, Sorenson said. On Saturday, Bacon helped fill the bags alongside what Sorenson estimated was about 700 students and 300 community members. Sorenson, who graduated from Payson High School in 1995, said DJs always play the song \u201cFootloose\u201d at proms, and students recreate the film's iconic dance. Older residents tell stories of being an extra in the film and delight in pointing out spots in Payson shown in the movie, he said. \u201cIt's something they can be proud of, and it\u2019s fun for them,\u201d the principal said.",

            "date": "2024-04-21 10:13:00",
            "content": "Andrew Davis, an acclaimed British conductor who was music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and orchestras on three continents, has died. He was 80. Davis died Saturday at Rusk Institute in Chicago from leukemia, his manager, Jonathan Brill of Opus 3 Artists, said Sunday. Davis had been managing the disease for between 1 1/2 and 2 years, but it became acute shortly after his 80th birthday on Feb. 2. He had conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra last December in the U.S. premiere of his own orchestration of Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah.\u201d \u201cA consummate musician, incredibly versatile and a phenomenal colleague, as well,\" soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming said in an email to The Associated Press. \"It takes a special kind of command to be a great conductor, the power to make close to a hundred musicians (each one, at heart, a diva or divo) hang on your tiniest gesture. So it is remarkable that even with that strength, Andrew\u2019s primary quality was his innate happiness. He was gifted with an infectious joy that somehow came through in every bar of music he made.\u201d As his 80th birthday approached, Davis was invigorated by the challenge of molding an orchestra, especially young players. \u201cHarnessing all that energy and that enthusiasm and that passion, and galvanizing it into a totally, totally unified conception and not just conception but \u2014 what's the word? \u2014 realization,\" he said during an interview with the AP last July after rehearsing the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America in workshops and then at New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall. \u201cI berate them more than I would, but I hope always with a twinkle in my eye.\u201d Davis was music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra from 1975-88 and Britain's Glyndebourne Festival from 1988-2000; chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1989-2000 and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra from 2013-19; then music director of the Lyric Opera from 2000-21. Davis made his Lyric Opera debut in 1987 and led about 700 performances of 62 operas by 22 composers. \u201cHe was a true artistic partner to me and a shining light for so many of us,\u201d Lyric Opera general director Anthony Freud said in a statement. \u201cWe will miss his incredible artistry, his extraordinary wisdom, his irrepressible humor, his unfettered zest for life and his devotion to the arts and the humanities.\u201d Davis conducted a dozen Last Night of the Proms concerts, an annual celebration of Britain at London's Royal Albert Hall. He twice gave the customary speech in the patter of the Major General\u2019s song from Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s \u201cThe Pirates of Penzance.\u201d Born in Ashridge, in the Hertfordshire county of England, Andrew Frank Davis played organ for his parish choir and joined the choir at the Watford Grammar School for Boys. He studied piano at London's Royal Academy of Music in London, became an organ student at King\u2019s College Cambridge, and played piano, harpsichord and organ with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields from 1966-70. He made his conducting debut with the BBC Symphony in 1970, became an assistant conductor with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Philharmonia Orchestra, then in 1971 made his North American debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. \u201cOne of the finest conductors of his generation,\u201d Carnegie Hall executive and artistic director Clive Gillinson said. \u201cI worked with him on an ongoing basis at the London Symphony Orchestra, and the players and I were always totally engaged by his superb musicianship.\" Davis made his opera-conducting debut in Strauss' \u201cCapriccio\u201d at the Glyndebourne in 1973 and the following year met his future wife, soprano Gianna Rolandi, when she sang Zerbinetta in performances of Strauss' \u201cAriadne auf Naxos\u201d that he led at New York's Metropolitan Opera. They got married in 1989 and had a son, composer Edward Frazier Davis. Davis became a Commander of the British Empire in 1992 and a Knight Bachelor in 1999. The family moved to Chicago when he was hired by the Lyric Opera. During the pandemic, Davis translated Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid\u201d from Latin into English verse. \"I took an entrance exam in classics in New College, Oxford,\" he told NPR, \u201cbut then a couple of weeks later I took the organ scholarship trials at King's College, Cambridge, which much to my surprise I won, so that was the end of classics for me.\u201d His wife died in 2021. In addition to his son, he is survived by a sister, Jill Atkins, and brothers Martin Davis and Tim Davis. Funeral services will be private. ___ This story corrects the year Davis made his Lyric Opera debut. It was in 1987, not 1986.",

            "date": "2024-04-21 12:52:00",
            "content": "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cCivil War,\u201d Alex Garland\u2019s ominous American dystopia, remained the top film in theaters in its second week of release, according to studio estimates Sunday. The A24 election -year gamble, the indie studio\u2019s biggest budgeted film yet, took in $11.1 million in ticket sales at 3,929 theaters over the weekend. The $50 million film, set in a near-future U.S. in which Texas and California have joined in rebellion against a fascist president, has grossed $44.9 million in two weeks. Its provocative premise \u2013 and A24\u2019s marketing, which included images of U.S. cities ravaged by war \u2013 helped keep \u201cCivil War\u201d top of mind for moviegoers. But it was a painfully slow weekend in theaters \u2013 the kind sure to add to concern over what\u2019s thus far been a down year for Hollywood at the box office. Year-to-date ticket sales are down almost 20% compared to last year, according to Comscore. Going into the weekend, Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cAbigail,\u201d a critically acclaimed R-rated horror film about the daughter of Dracula, had been expected to lead ticket sales. It came in second with $10.2 million in 3,384 theaters. That was still a fair result for a film that cost a modest $28 million to make. \u201cAbigail,\u201d which remakes the 1936 monster film \u201cDracula\u2019s Daughter,\u201d is about a 12-year-old girl taken by kidnappers who soon realize they\u2019ve made a poor choice of hostage. It\u2019s directed by the duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett whose production company goes by the name Radio Silence. More concerning was the overall tepid response for a handful of new wide releases \u2013 and the likelihood that there will be more similar weekends throughout 2024. Last year\u2019s actors and writers' strikes, which had a prolonged effect on the movie pipeline, exacerbated holes in Hollywood\u2019s release schedule. Horror films, in recent years among the most reliable cash cows in theaters, also haven\u2019t thus far been doing the automatic business they previous did. According to David A. Gross, who runs the consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, horror releases accounted for $2 billion in worldwide sales in 2023. Guy Ritchie\u2019s \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\u201d debuted with $9 million in 2,845 theaters. In the based-on-a-true-story Lionsgate release, which reportedly cost $60 million to produce, Henry Cavill leads a World War II mission off the coast of West Africa. Though Ritchie has been behind numerous box-office hits, including the live-action \u201cAladdin\u201d and a pair of Sherlock Holmes films, his recent movies have struggled to find big audiences. The Lionsgate spy comedy \u201cOperation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre\u201d grossed $48 million against a $50 million budget, while MGM\u2019s \u201cThe Covenant,\u201d also released last year, made $21 million while costing $55 million to make. A bright sign for \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\u201d: audiences liked it. The film earned an A-minus CinemaScore. The anime \u201cSpy x Family Code: White,\u201d from Sony\u2019s Crunchyroll, also struggled to stand out with audiences. Though the adaptation of the Tatsuya Endo manga TV series \u201cSpy x Family\u201d has already been a hit with international moviegoers, it debuted below expectations with $4.9 million in 2,009 U.S. theaters. The mightiest film globally, though, continues to be \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\u201d The Warner Bros. monster movie has for the past month led worldwide ticket sales. It added another $9.5 million domestically and $21.6 million internationally to bring its four-week global total to $485.2 million. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. \u201cCivil War,\u201d $11.1 million. 2. \u201cAbigail,\u201d $10.2 million. 3. \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire,\u201d $9.5 million. 4. \u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,\u201d $9 million. 5. \u201cSpy x Family Code: White,\u201d $4.9 million. 6. \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\" $4.6 million. 7. \u201cGhostbusters: Frozen Empire,\u201d $4.4 million. 8. \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d $2.9 million. 9. \u201cMonkey Man,\u201d $2.2 million. 10. \u201cThe First Omen,\u201d $1.7 million.",

            "date": "2024-04-21 01:06:00",
            "content": "If you were to close Alicia Keys \u2019 big semi-autobiographical musical on Broadway with any of her hit songs, which would it be? Of course, it has to be \u201cEmpire State of Mind.\u201d That\u2019s the natural one, right? It\u2019s also as predictable as the R train being delayed with signal problems. \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d the coming-of-age musical about a 17-year-old piano prodigy named Ali, has wonderful new and old tunes by the 16-time Grammy Award winner and a talented cast, but only a sliver of a very safe story that tries to seem more consequential than it is. It wants to be authentic and gritty \u2014 a remarkable number of swear words are used, including 19 f-bombs \u2014 for what ultimately is a portrait of a young, talented woman living on the 42nd floor of a doorman building in Manhattan who relearns to love her protective mom. The musical that opened Saturday at the Shubert Theatre features reworks of Keys\u2019 best-known hits: \u201cFallin\u2019,\u201d \u201cNo One,\u201d \u201cGirl on Fire,\u201d \u201cIf I Ain\u2019t Got You,\u201d as well as several new songs, including the terrific \u201cKaleidoscope.\u201d That Keys is a knockout songwriter, there is no doubt. That playwright Kristoffer Diaz is able to make a convincing, relatable rom-com that's also socially conscious is very much in doubt. This is, appropriately, a woman-led show, with Maleah Joi Moon completely stunning in the lead role \u2014 a jaw-dropping vocalist who is funny, giggly, passionate and strident, a star turn. Shoshana Bean, who plays her single, spiky mom, makes her songs soar, while Kecia Lewis as a soulful piano teacher is the show's astounding MVP. When we meet Ali, she's a frustrated teen who knows there's more to life and \u201csomething's calling me,\u201d as she sings in the new song, \u201cThe River.\u201d At first that's a boy: the sweet Chris Lee, playing a house painter. There's also reconnecting with her unreliable dad, a nicely slippery Brandon Victor Dixon. But the thing calling Ali is, of course, the grand piano in her building's multipurpose room. Outside this apartment building in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood \u2014 we get a clue the time is the early 1990s \u2014 are \u201croaches and the rats/heroin in the cracks.\u201d But no criminality is shown \u2014 at worst some illegal krumping? \u2014 and the cops don\u2019t actually brutalize those citizens deemed undesirable. They sort of just shoo them away. This is a sanitized New York for the M & M store tourists, despite the lyrics in Keys\u2019 songs. Another reason the musical fails to fully connect is that a lot of the music played onstage is fake \u2014 it's actually the orchestra tucked into the sides making those piano scales and funky percussion. (Even the three bucket drummers onstage are mostly just pretending, which is a shame.) For a musical about a singular artist and how important music is, this feels a bit like a cheat. Choreography by Camille A. Brown is muscular and fun using a hip-hop vocabulary, and director Michael Greif masterfully keeps things moving elegantly. But there's \u2014 forgive me \u2014 everything but the kitchen sink thrown in here: A supposed-to-be-funny chorus of two mom friends and two Ali friends, a ghost, some mild parental abuse and a weird fixation with dinner. The way the songs are integrated is inspired, with \u201cGirl on Fire\u201d hysterically interrupted by rap bars, \u201cFallin\u2019\u201d turned into a humorously seductive ballad and \"No One\u201d transformed from an achy love song to a mother-daughter anthem. But everyone is waiting for that song about \u201cconcrete jungles\u201d where \u201cbig lights will inspire you.\u201d It comes right after we see a young woman snuggling on a couch, high over the city she will soon conquer. You can, too, if you just go past the doorman and follow your dreams. ___ Follow Mark Kennedy online.",

The lodge said Saturday in a Facebook post that it will support guests while repairs are being done, as well as work to ensure water quality. Historic preservation efforts are also underway. \u201cThere are challenges ahead but we are through the worst of it,\u201d the hotel said. \u201cFirst responder and Timberline staff efforts have been nothing short of remarkable during a very difficult time. This successful recovery is because of their dedication.\u201d Embers from the lodge's large stone fireplace apparently ignited the roof Thursday night, the lodge said.

            "content": "A California mom is speaking out after accidentally inviting all 487 of her phone contacts to her daughter's upcoming first birthday party . Emily King, who shared the hilarious incident in a now-viral TikTok video , told \"Good Morning America\" she still vividly remembers that sinking feeling she had when she realized she had made a giant mistake. \"I kind of like, immediately knew. I was like, 'Wait, something's wrong. \u2026 This is not happening.' So like, all the blood rushes from my body,\" King recalled of the moment on April 10 when she noticed the online invitation service she was using sent a digital invitation to her entire list after she had imported her phone contacts to the platform. Emily King opened up on TikTok about accidentally inviting 487 people to her daughter\u2019s first birthday party. Courtesy Emily King King said that when she was setting up her daughter Ivy's June birthday party invitation, she noticed Evite, the service she was using on her smartphone, offered an option to import the contact information of potential guests. \"I see this tab and it says 'import guests from previous parties.' And I just had a St. Patrick's Day party so I was like, 'Oh, perfect,'\" King explained of her thought process. Emily King and her husband Oscar are parents of a daughter and are expecting their second daughter later this year. Courtesy Emily King After importing her contacts, King thought she would be able to select which one of them would receive an invitation. But, that wasn't the case. \"It took me to the actual invitation page, and it said 'Ivy's first birthday' -- and then at the bottom, it said, 'Guests: 487' \u2026 and I was mortified,\" King said. \"I started to look at the list and it's everyone that I had ever put in my phone,\" King said. \"And not only that, it's everyone I put in my phone as they are stored in my phone \u2026 and everyone that I ever emailed through my job.\" Emily King is planning to host her daughter Ivy\u2019s first birthday party at a park. Courtesy Emily King King, a teacher, said she was confused at first, and then unnerved that acquaintances she had met once, including her co-workers and students, were included in the guest list in addition to close family and friends she had intended to invite. The kicker, too, was that everyone received a text message invitation based on what they were labeled in her phone contacts list. \"It's like, 'cute boy from the bar' and \u2026 like 'old man neighbor' and it's like, 'Derek eyeroll emoji' and I hit this girl's car in a grocery store parking lot once [and] it said 'Jess hit car in parking lot,'\" King said. \"Like, all of these people and they said they're on the invite list and that's how they received the invite in their phone.\" King estimated that within five minutes of realizing what she had done, she quickly deleted the party event. The invitation text messages, however, had already been sent out, and King and her friends were able to laugh about it afterward. \"At first I was mortified, but I like to think I have a pretty good sense of humor,\" King said. \"So I was like, I was embarrassed but then also cracking up, like I couldn't stop laughing that this had happened.\" MORE: Mom goes viral with hilarious and honest birthday party invitation King said she hopes others can learn from her mistake, which she said was simply \"too funny not to share.\" Editor\u2019s Picks Funny video parodies dad\u2019s dream scenario about things he keeps around \u2018just in case\u2019 Bride shares mom's hilarious wedding photo book fail This 1-year-old's Guy Fieri birthday party will take you down to 'Flavortown' \"Always double check before you select anything that looks like it could be a 'Select All' button,\" she said.

As for Ivy's first birthday party, King said it's back on and will be a \"Lord of the Rings\"-themed bash. Plus, she decided to expand her guest list from 50 to 70 invitees. Emily King said she wanted to throw a Lord of the Rings-themed birthday party for her daughter Ivy. Courtesy Emily King \"It's going to be definitely a first birthday for the books.

The couple, who became famous for their show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" were sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison on charges including fraud and tax evasion. Todd was sentenced to 12 years in prison and 16 months of probation while Julie was ordered to serve seven years in prison and 16 months of probation. Their case returned to a federal appeals court in Atlanta on Friday as they seek an appeal to review what they consider a court error. During the 30-minute hearing, Todd and Julie Chrisley\u2019s attorney argued that they deserve a new trial. While the Chrisleys were not present in court, their attorney says they were both able to listen in via live-stream from prison. \"The primary issue we were arguing about is the questions if one of the witnesses testified falsely and if the prosecution had knowledge of it,\" attorney Alex Little said. Savannah, who traveled from her home in Nashville to support her parents, said this was a step toward getting her parents home because she believes in law and order. \"I believe we should have a system that holds people accountable, but the government needs to be held accountable as well,\" she said. In an interview with \"Nightline's\" Juju Chang ahead of the appeal hearing and which airs in full tonight at 12:37 a.m. ET, Savannah reflected on the moment she bid farewell to Chris and Julie before the pair reported to prison in January 2023.

            "date": "2018-06-14 04:04:00",
            "content": "Hundreds of islands and cays that comprise the Bahamas have long been a tropical playground for the rich, super-rich, and mind-bogglingly rich. Be that as it may, it is quite possible for the non-A-listers of the world to find a quiet slice of Bahamian paradise to call their own -- and to do so without sending their savings into a nosedive. Here's how to get started: Take a look at these 11 heavenly and affordable hideaways, each one posted up on a spectacular beach where the sand is snowy white and the water miraculously bright blue. 1. Pigeon Cay Beach Club, Cat Island Pigeon Cay Beach Club Oyster.com Intimate Pigeon Cay Beach Club is located on the largely undeveloped Cat Island (130 miles southeast of Nassau), where it's possible to wander the gorgeous coastline for miles without spotting a soul -- or a boat, dock, or Jet Ski. A similar end-of-the-world ethos is found at this tiny, charmingly ramshackle hotel, where seven rustic cottages face a beautiful beach with vibrant teal water that truly merits the word \"stunning.\" TVs, AC, and Wi-Fi are all happily off-duty, leaving guests to explore the island by bike, canoe, or kayak (all free to use) or quietly drop by the honor-system beach bar. Meals can be served at the bar, on the beach, or in the cottages, which all have full kitchens and furnished outdoor spaces. 2. Shannas Cove Resort, Cat Island Shannas Cove Resort Oyster.com Located up a dirt path, Shannas Cove Resort is a rambling, relaxed hilltop resort with lovely ocean views and natural grounds full of palms, flowers, and ferns. Shannas' five bungalows are nothing fancy, but they feature private furnished porches with dazzling ocean views. (They lack Wi-Fi and Pigeon Cay's kitchens, but do have mini-fridges and TVs with a few channels.) Like Pigeon Cay, Shannas' highlight is its big beach, which has free water sports, ivory sand, and calm, seemingly unnatural turquoise water. Guests usually have the beach to themselves, or just about, and there's a nature trail off the resort that leads to more deserted, drop-dead gorgeous beaches. For all its solitude, however, Shannas isn't without a social element: In the evenings, fellow guests tend to gather in the restaurant's bar. 3. Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat, Paradise Island Sivananda Ashram yoga Retreat Oyster.com Pay no mind to the cruise ships tooting Disney horn songs in the harbor and the Atlantis resort mini-city down the beach. Tucked between these monster tourist entities is Sivananda, a serious ashram with a regimented schedule of yoga and meditation. Days begin with a 5:30 a.m. gong, waking guests for morning satsang -- meditation, chanting, singing, and lectures -- followed by a two-hour yoga class on an open platform on the beach or by the harbor. After class comes the first of two lacto-vegetarian meals, then free time, when guests can attend extra workshops or lounge on the white-sand beach. Next up, more yoga, dinner, and the evening satsang. Accommodations range from camping and tent huts to beachfront suites (most rooms have shared bathrooms, though). The twice-daily yoga, meditations, and buffet-style meals are all included in the price, which, for those pitching their own tents or staying in one of the platform tents, can be extremely low. 4. Small Hope Bay Lodge, Andros Small Hope Bay Lodge Oyster.com The eco-friendly Small Hope Bay Lodge has some of the most reasonable rates on Andros Island -- the largest of the Bahamas, but a place made up mostly of impenetrable bush, inland waterways, and mangrove marsh. Despite its rugged and secluded location, Small Hope's all-inclusive structure means that rates cover all meals, bar drinks, regular beverages, and nightly conch fritter hors d'oeuvres. Sailing, kayaking, windsurfing, paddleboarding, and biking are all free, plus guests can embark on dive trips (including wreck and blue hole dives) near and around Andros Barrier Reef, the sixth-largest in the world. Small Hope's beachfront cabins feature wood-beamed ceilings and whitewashed walls, as well as Danish-style lounge chairs, woven rugs, and local Androsia Batik fabrics. 5. Compass Point Beach Resort, Nassau Compass Point Beach Resort Oyster.com Compass Point Beach Resort may be New Providence Island's most interesting property. The resort was opened in 1995 by legendary music producer Chris Blackwell, who owned a nearby recording studio where Bob Marley, Eric Clapton, and the Rolling Stones all laid down tracks. Between studio sessions, many famous artists would crash at Compass Point Beach Resort. The resort's appearance is as noteworthy as its history: It's composed of 18 rainbow-colored huts inspired by Junkanoo, the Bahamian street parade. All rooms have surround-sound music systems and balconies, and some include open-air kitchenettes, dining spaces, and second bedrooms. Daily housekeeping comes at a fee, but freebies include Wi-Fi, self-parking, and continental breakfast at the hip, breezy restaurant with impressive ocean views and regular live music. Compass Point is on stunning Love Beach, a mile-long stretch of milky sand that is one of the loveliest beaches on the island. It's a great spot for snorkeling, and its out-of-the-way location means that it's rarely crowded. 6. Pineapple Fields Resort, Eleuthera Pineapple Fields Resort Oyster.com First-timers to Pineapple Fields Resort, keep your eyes peeled. This mellow condo complex has an obscure entrance along a back road in central Eleuthera, an already sleepy place with an extra-chilled-out Bahamian vibe (precisely why many -- including royalties and VIPs -- choose the island as a vacation destination).

            "date": "2024-04-24 16:41:00",
            "content": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- The manufacturer of a popular weedkiller won support Wednesday from the Missouri House for a proposal that could shield it from costly lawsuits alleging it failed to warn customers its product could cause cancer. The House vote marked an important but incremental victory for chemical giant Bayer, which acquired an avalanche of legal claims involving the weedkiller Roundup when it bought the product's original St. Louis-area-based producer, Monsanto. The legislation now heads to the Missouri Senate with several weeks remaining in the annual legislative session. Bayer pursued similar legislation this year in Idaho and Iowa, where it has mining and manufacturing facilities, but it fell short in both states. Bayer disputes claims that Roundup's key ingredient, glyphosate, causes a cancer called non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. But it has set aside $16 billion and already paid about $10 billion of that amount to resolve some of the tens of thousands of legal claims against it. Though some studies associate glyphosate with cancer, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. The Missouri legislation says that federally approved pesticide labeling \u201cshall be sufficient to satisfy any requirement for a warning label regarding cancer\u201d \u2014 effectively thwarting failure-to-warn allegations in future lawsuits. \u201cWe are grateful that members of the Missouri House have supported farmers and science over the litigation industry,\" Bayer said in a statement Wednesday. A coalition that includes Bayer has run ads on radio stations, newspapers and billboards supporting the legislation. Farmers overwhelmingly rely on Roundup, which was introduced 50 years ago as a more efficient way to control weeds and reduce tilling and soil erosion. For crops including corn, soybeans and cotton, it\u2019s designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist Roundup\u2019s deadly effect. More than a dozen majority party Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the legislation as it passed the House on a 91-57 vote. Some Democrats made personal pleas to vote no. \u201cIf you vote for this bill, you are voting for cancer \u2014 and it will hurt my feelings, and I will not smile at you on the elevator,\" said state Rep. LaDonna Appelbaum, who is undergoing treatment for cancer. Supporters said it was important to protect Bayer, whose North American crop science division is based in the St. Louis area, from lawsuits that could jeopardized the availability of Roundup. They cited concerns that Bayer eventually could pull Roundup from the U.S. market, leaving farmers dependent on alternative chemicals from China. \u201cThis bill isn\u2019t about cancer, it\u2019s really about the process of what\u2019s taken place within the courts,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Mike Haffner, chair of the House Agriculture Policy Committee.",

            "content": "Dairy cattle moving between states must be tested for the bird flu virus, U.S. agriculture officials said Wednesday as they try to track and control the growing outbreak. The federal order was announced one day after health officials said they had detected inactivated remnants of the virus, known as Type A H5N1, in samples taken from milk during processing and from store shelves. They stressed that such remnants pose no known risk to people or the milk supply. \u201cThe risk to humans remains low,\u201d said Dawn O'Connell of the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. The new order, which goes into effect Monday, requires every lactating cow to be tested and post a negative result before moving to a new state. It will help the agency understand how the virus is spreading, said Michael Watson, an administrator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. \u201cWe believe we can do tens of thousands of tests a day,\u201d he told reporters. Until now, testing had been done voluntarily and only in cows with symptoms. Avian influenza was first detected in dairy cows in March and has been found in nearly three dozen herds in eight states, according to USDA. It's an escalation of an ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread by wild birds. Since the start of the outbreak, more than 90 million birds in U.S. commercial flocks have either died from the virus or been killed to try to prevent spread. Two people in the U.S. \u2014 both farmworkers \u2014 have been infected with bird flu since the outbreak began. Health officials said 23 people have been tested for bird flu to date and 44 people exposed to infected animals are being monitored. Officials said that samples from a cow in Kansas showed that the virus could be adapting to more animals and they detected H5N1 virus in the lung tissue of a dairy cow that had been culled and sent to slaughter. So far, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have seen no signs that the virus is changing to be more transmissible to people. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

            "content": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand \u2014 and stop \u2014 the growing outbreak. So far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people. The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Starting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested \u2014 with negative results \u2014 before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order. Here's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation: This strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska. The virus was discovered in ruminants \u2014 goats and then dairy cows \u2014 in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years. \u201cWhen we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. Flu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said. Scientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow. Finding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \u201csuggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\u201d said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota. Under pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week. The data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona. Since then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said. And then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said. \u201cThe genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\u201d Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\" Several experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start. \u201cWe need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\u201d said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school. Worobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said. \"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\u201d he said. More testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said. \u201cIncreased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\u201d Aliota said. \u201cIt helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\" Scientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon. While the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk. Also, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said. So far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms. David O\u2019Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning. \u201cThere are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we\u2019re not there,\u201d he said. As with a tornado watch, \"you wouldn\u2019t change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.\u201d Worobey said this is the kind of outbreak \u201cthat we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.\" He said ambitious screening is needed \"to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.\u201d ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

            "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Oracle Corp.'s planned campus in Nashville, Tennessee, will serve as the business software giant's world headquarters, placing it in a city that's a center for the U.S. health care industry, company Chairman Larry Ellison said. Ellison spoke about Oracle's plans for its Nashville offices during a conversation about health care technology with former U.S. Sen. Bill Frist at the Oracle Health Summit on Tuesday. In 2021, a Tennessee panel approved $65 million in state incentives for Oracle, with the company planning to bring 8,500 jobs and an investment topping $1 billion to Nashville over a decade. Then-Mayor John Cooper\u2019s office announced that the company, currently based in Austin, Texas, planned to build the new campus with 1.2 million square feet (111,400 square meters) of office space. In 2020, Oracle announced it was moving its headquarters from its longtime home in Redwood City, California, to Texas. Frist, a doctor and businessman, asked Ellison why Nashville was chosen. Ellison, whose company bought electronic medical records company Cerner in 2022, called the city \u201ca health center.\u201d \u201cWe're moving this huge campus, which will ultimately be our world headquarters,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cWe're moving that to Nashville.\u201d Ellison then joked that he \u201cshouldn't have said that.\u201d According to the Nashville Health Care Council, Tennessee's capital city has more than 900 companies with 550,000 employees working in the health care industry. HCA Healthcare and Change Healthcare are among the large companies based in the growing city. Ellison, who is also the company's chief technology officer, said Oracle wants to be part of a community where people want to live. He said the city \u201cticked all the boxes\u201d in employee surveys. \u201cNashville is a fabulous place to live,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cIt's a great place to raise a family. It's got a unique and vibrant culture .... It's the center of the industry we're most concerned about, which is the health care industry.\u201d The Nashville mayor\u2019s office said in 2021 that Oracle paid $254 million for 60 acres (24 hectares) in downtown Nashville and offered $175 million upfront for public infrastructure, including a pedestrian bridge over the Cumberland River, environmental cleanup, a sewer pump station and a riverfront park. Ellison said plans for the riverfront campus include a community clinic, a concert venue, a hotel and a restaurant. Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell said his office has been actively engaged with Oracle since he was elected last year, \u201cand it\u2019s been clear that they intended to enhance the level of activity at their River North campus.\u201d \u201cWe are a complete city that also checks the box for business,\u201d O\u2019Connell said in a statement. ___ This story has been updated to correct that Ellison is Oracle's chairman, not CEO.",

            "content": "Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta said Wednesday its first-quarter profit more than doubled, boosted by higher advertising revenue and a 6% increase on the average price of ads on its platforms. But its shares dropped sharply in after-hours trading following lukewarm revenue guidance. Meta Platforms Inc. earned $12.37 billion, or $4.71 per share, in the January-March period. That's up from $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 27% to $36.46 billion from $28.65 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $4.32 per share on revenue of $36.14 billion, according to a poll by FactSet. For the current quarter, the Menlo Park, California-based company said it expects revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. Analysts are expecting revenue of $38.25 billion for the second quarter, which is higher than the midpoint of Meta's guidance range. Meta also said it expects its 2024 capital expenses to be higher than anticipated due to its investments in artificial intelligence . It is forecasting expenses in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its earlier guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion. The company has been investing heavily in AI and earlier this month unveiled a new set of artificial intelligence systems that are powering what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls \u201cthe most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\u201d Meta, along with leading AI developers Google and OpenAI, and startups such as Anthropic, Cohere and France\u2019s Mistral, have been churning out new AI language models and hoping to persuade customers they\u2019ve got the smartest, handiest or most efficient chatbots. \u201cMeta\u2019s earnings should serve as a stark warning for companies reporting this earnings season,\" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com \u201cEven though the company did beat estimates in all top- and bottom-line metrics, it didn\u2019t matter as much as the reported lowering revenue expectations for Q2. This is the exact opposite of what Tesla did yesterday and goes to show that investors are currently looking at the near future with heavy mistrust.\u201d On Tuesday, electric vehicle maker Tesla reported that its first-quarter net income plummeted 55%. But it said it would accelerate production of new, more affordable vehicles, and on Wednesday its stock rose 12%. The number of people using Meta's apps, meanwhile, continued to increase, with 3.24 billion users on average for March in its \u201cfamily of apps\u201d that includes Facebook , Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. That's up 7% year-over-year. Beginning this quarter, the company will no longer disclose user figures for Facebook. Meta had 69,329 workers as of March 31, a decrease of 10% year-over-year. Zuckerberg called 2023 the \u201cyear of efficiency\" and the company laid off thousands to reduce expenses. Meta's shares fell 16% in after-hours trading. Meta's stock price has more than doubled over the past year thanks to a rebound in online advertising.",

            "title": "New California rule aims to limit health care cost increases to 3% annually",
            "date": "2024-04-24 19:26:00",
            "content": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies in California will be limited to annual price increases of 3% starting in 2029 under a new rule state regulators approved Wednesday in the latest attempt to corral the ever-increasing costs of medical care in the United States. The money Californians spent on health care went up about 5.4% each year for the past two decades. Democrats who control California's government say that's too much, especially since most people's income increased just 3% each year over that same time period. The 3% cap, approved Wednesday by the Health Care Affordability Board, would be phased in over five years, starting with 3.5% in 2025. Board members said the cap likely won't be enforced until the end of the decade. A new state agency, the Office of Health Care Affordability, will gather data to enforce the rule. Providers who don't comply could face fines. \u201cWe want to be aggressive,\u201d board chair Dr. Mark Ghaly said, while acknowledging that the cap \u201creally translates into a major challenge\" for the health care industry. The vote is just the start of the process. Regulators will later decide how the cost target will be applied across the state\u2019s various health care sectors. And enforcement will be progressive, with several chances for providers to avoid fines. California's health care industry has supported the idea of a statewide cost target but argued a 3% cap is too low and will be nearly impossible to meet. In December, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the cost to practice medicine in the United States would increase 4.6% this year alone. The board based the target on the average annual change in median household income in California between 2002 and 2022, which was 3%. Dr. Tanya W. Spirtos, president of the California Medical Association that represents doctors, wrote a letter to the board noting that number is \u201cartificially low\u201d because it includes the years of the Great Recession, when income dropped dramatically. She said a better gauge would be looking at the past 10 years, when median household income increased an average of 4.1% per year. Hospitals argue much of what they charge is outside of their control. More than half of hospitals' expenses are salaries for workers, and many of those are set through collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Plus, a new state law that takes effect this year will gradually increase the minimum wage for health care workers to $25 per hour. More than half of California\u2019s 425 hospitals are losing money, and many rural facilities are in danger of closing \u2014 prompting the state Legislature last year to approve an emergency loan program. Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the California Hospital Association, said when it comes to hospital finances, \u201cthe fat is already gone.\u201d She said hospitals regularly perform complex procedures that save lives, including quadruple bypass surgeries. \"We\u2019re fooling ourselves if we think that\u2019s cheap or can be done less expensively,\u201d she said. Health care spending in the United States has more than doubled in the past two decades, reaching $4.5 trillion in 2022, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Eight other states have set statewide cost targets for their health care industries. What makes California's cap different, experts say, is both the staggering size of the state's health care industry and its plan to enforce the limit with fines. Health providers could exceed the cap if they have a good reason, including giving raises to health care workers. Those issues have yet to be worked out and will be considered on a case by case basis. California has greatly expanded access to health insurance in recent years, including using taxpayer money to provide deep discounts for some middle-income earners and offering free coverage to all low-income adults regardless of their immigration status. State lawmakers have resisted more ambitious actions, including a single-payer system. \u201cMaking quality health care affordable is a top priority for our administration,\" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement released by his office. \"This action is a crucial first step forward in our efforts to reign in outrageous heath care costs and make health care more affordable.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s vote was the state\u2019s first foray into tackling health care spending in California, which reached $405 billion in 2020, or $10,299 per person \u2014 the 22nd highest in the nation. Still, costs have increased greatly for people who get health insurance through their job. In 2006, just 6% of California workers who had deductibles of $1,000 or more. By 2020, it was 54%. \u201cWe have a system right now that the incentives are not about getting the most cost efficient service,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California who advised the board on the new cost limit. \u201cThis is an attempt to try to have that incentive into a market that is more about getting bigger than about getting better.\u201d",

            "title": "Biden just signed a bill that could ban TikTok. His campaign plans to stay on the app anyway",
            "date": "2024-04-24 15:36:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- When President Joe Biden showed off his putting during a campaign stop at a public golf course in Michigan last month, the moment was captured on TikTok . Forced inside by a rainstorm, he competed with 13-year-old Hurley \u201cHJ\u201d Coleman IV to make putts on a practice mat. The Coleman family posted video of the proceedings on the app \u2014 complete with Biden holing out a putt and the teen knocking his own shot home in response, over the caption, \u201cI had to sink the rebuttal.\u201d The network television cameras that normally follow the president were stuck outside. Biden signed legislation Wednesday that could ban TikTok in the U.S. while his campaign has embraced the platform and tried to work with influencers. Already struggling to maintain his previous support from younger voters, the president is now facing criticism from some avid users of the app, which researchers have found is a primary news source for a third of Americans under the age of 30. \u201cThere\u2019s a core hypocrisy to the Biden administration supporting the TikTok ban while at the same time using TikTok for his campaign purposes,\u201d said Kahlil Greene, who has more than 650,000 followers and is known on TikTok as the \u201cGen Z Historian.\u201d \u201cI think it illustrates that he and his people know the power and necessity of TikTok.\u201d The Biden campaign defends its approach and rejects the idea that White House policy is contradicting its political efforts. \u201cWe would be silly to write off any place where people are getting information about the president,\u201d said Rob Flaherty, who ran the White House\u2019s Office of Digital Strategy and now is deputy manager of Biden\u2019s reelection campaign. Flaherty said Biden's team forged relationships with TikTok influencers the 2020 election and that the platform has only gotten more influential since then, \u201cgrowing as an internet search engine and driving narratives about the president.\u201d The Biden campaign says that an increasingly fragmented modern media environment requires it to meet voters where they are and that TikTok is one of many such places where would-be supporters see its content, in addition to platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. It has produced its own TikTok content, but also relied on everyday users who interact with the president. That includes a post from a family that ate fries and other fixings from the Cook Out fast food chain when Biden recently visited Raleigh, North Carolina, as well as Coleman\u2019s putting video. Opponents of TikTok say its ownership by Chinese company ByteDance gives Beijing a dangerous amount of influence over what narratives Americans see as well as potential access to U.S. user data. Chinese national-security laws allow the ruling Communist Party wide latitude over private business, though the U.S. has not made public evidence that the Chinese government has manipulated the app or forced ByteDance to do its bidding. The law Biden signed Wednesday would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. ByteDance has argued the law violates the First Amendment and promised to sue. Former President Donald Trump , the presumptive Republican nominee, now publicly opposes a TikTok ban after issuing an executive order while in office trying to ban the app if ByteDance didn\u2019t sell it. The White House doesn't have an official TikTok account and Biden banned the app on most government devices in December 2022. Yet the Biden campaign also officially joined TikTok on the night of this year's Super Bowl, as the president shunned a traditional gameday TV interview to instead spread a political message with the platform. Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki convened a virtual briefing in 2022 for more than two dozen of the app\u2019s influencers to discuss the U.S. approach to Ukraine, a gathering later parodied on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d There have been scores of other such events, including an influencer party at the White House last Christmas and a State of the Union watch party in March. During Biden\u2019s recent, $26 million campaign fundraiser at New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton , there was an influencer happy hour and an after-party where attendees interacted with Biden. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the legislation Biden signed \u201cis not a ban. This is about our national security.\u201d She added that the White House isn\u2019t saying \u201cthat we do not want Americans to use TikTok.\" TikTok has 170 million U.S. users and a study released last November by the Pew Research Center found that about a third of U.S. adults under 30 regularly got news from TikTok, compared to 14% of all adults. Adults under 30 are more likely than U.S. adults overall to oppose a ban on the use of TikTok in the United States, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in January. Nearly half of 18- to 29-year-olds are opposed, compared to 35% of U.S. adults. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults said then they use TikTok at least once a day, including 44% of 18- to 29-year-olds. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 7% say they use TikTok \u201calmost constantly\u201d and an additional 28% are using it \u201cseveral times a day.\u201d Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC, is spending around $1 million this cycle to help fund more than 100 TikTok influencers who produce pro-Biden content ahead of November, and views those efforts as an extension of traditional organizing and communications initiatives. Even if TikTok is eventually banned, most of its influencers are on other platforms that could continue to take their content, especially YouTube and Instagram, said Danielle Butterfield, Priorities USA\u2019s executive director. \u201cTikTok users are online generally and that\u2019s a lot of different places,\u201d said Butterfield, who was also deputy director of digital advertising for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Biden, meanwhile, has seen his standing with young people decline. About one-third of adults under 30 approve of how he\u2019s handling his job as president, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in March \u2014 a sharp drop from the roughly two-thirds approved when he first entered office. Greene studied history at Yale, served as the school\u2019s first Black student body president and graduated in 2022. He attended past White House events as an influencer, including a Juneteenth celebration and a West Wing event for the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping health care and green energy package, where he met both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. About a year ago, however, Greene says he began posting about Biden\u2019s championing a sweeping 1994 crime law that activists have long said contributed to the mass incarceration of racial minorities. He also criticized Biden's current administration for what he called \u201ca lack of specific policy made for Black Americans.\u201d Since then, while Greene continues to receive more general emails from the Biden administration, he said says he's no longer invited to more personal events while some \u201ccreators who fell in line, who are less critical\u201d are still going. Flaherty, Biden's deputy campaign manager, said the campaign has paid influencers in specific instances, like when their content has been used in ads, and that some content creators who work with the campaign have raised concerns about legislation forcing divestment. But he doesn't see it having a major Election Day impact. \u201cI think young voters aren\u2019t going to vote on TikTok,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cThey are going to vote on issues, which are discussed on TikTok but they\u2019re also discussed other places.\u201d Greene, however, said young voters' frustration with the Biden administration in other areas \u2014 particularly its handling of Israel-Hamas war \u2014 have combined with the TikTok divestment legislation to spell political problems for Biden. \u201cThere's no ability for me to overstate how that exacerbates the outcry,\" he said, \u201cand the dissatisfaction that people already have.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Linley Sanders contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-24 16:11:00",
            "content": "SEATTLE -- A Tesla that may have been operating on the company's Autopilot driving system hit and killed a motorcyclist near Seattle, raising questions about whether a recent recall went far enough to ensure Tesla drivers using Autopilot pay attention to the road. After the crash Friday in a suburban area about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of the city, the driver of a 2022 Tesla Model S told a Washington State Patrol trooper that he was using Autopilot and looked at his cellphone while the Tesla was moving. \u201cThe next thing he knew there was a bang and the vehicle lurched forward as it accelerated and collided with the motorcycle in front of him,\" the trooper wrote in a probable-cause document. The 56-year-old driver was arrested for investigation of vehicular homicide \u201cbased on the admitted inattention to driving, while on Autopilot mode, and the distraction of the cell phone while moving forward, putting trust in the machine to drive for him,\u201d the affidavit said. The Tesla driver told the trooper that he was driving home from having lunch when the crash occurred at about 3:45 p.m. The motorcyclist, Jeffrey Nissen, 28, of Stanwood, Washington, was under the car and pronounced dead at the scene, authorities reported. Authorities said they have not yet independently verified whether Autopilot was in use at the time of the crash. \u201cWe have not gotten that far yet. It\u2019s very early stages of the investigation,\u201d Washington State Patrol Capt. Deion Glover said Wednesday. The death comes about four months after U.S. auto safety regulators pressured Tesla into recalling more than 2 million vehicles to fix a defective system that's supposed to make sure drivers pay attention when using Autopilot. A message was left Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla, which collects online data from its vehicles. Under the December recall, part of a two-year investigation into Teslas on Autopilot hitting emergency vehicles parked on roadways, Tesla reluctantly agreed to update Autopilot software to increase warnings and alerts to drivers. Autopilot can keep a car centered in its lane and a distance from vehicles in front of it, but Tesla says on its website that the cars can't drive themselves, despite the name. The company's monitoring system sends alerts to drivers if it fails to detect torque from hands on the steering wheel, a system that experts have described as inadequate. They say the systems should have infrared cameras that make sure drivers have their eyes on the road. It's not known whether the Tesla involved in the Washington motorcyclist's death got the software update specified in the recall, but documents filed by Tesla with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration say most newer Teslas have software that would automatically include the update. Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology for Consumer Reports, said it's her understanding that the software update automatically went to most Teslas. Many Teslas have cameras in the cabin that can watch drivers using Autopilot, but Funkhouser said Consumer Reports found in testing that the cameras can be covered up by drivers without consequences. The government should be investigating the crash to see if the recall fixes are doing what they were intended to do, said Philip Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies vehicle-automation safety. If Autopilot was in use, \u201cNHTSA should be looking at this as a data point as to whether Tesla has effectively removed unreasonable risk from the use of Autopilot,\u201d Koopman said. \u201cThe problem is this affects other road users, which is why regulatory intervention is appropriate.\u201d A message was left seeking comment from NHTSA. Since 2016, the agency has sent investigators to at least 35 crashes in which Teslas suspected of operating on a partially automated driving system hit parked emergency vehicles, motorcyclists or tractor trailers that crossed in the vehicles\u2019 paths, causing a total of 17 deaths. The agency also is investigating crashes involving automated driving systems from other automakers. Most recently it sent teams to two fatal crashes involving Ford Mustang Mach-E electric vehicles. ____ Krisher reported from Detroit.",

            "date": "2024-04-24 13:17:00",
            "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- For the first time in more than a year, the monthly board meeting of Walt Disney World's governing district on Wednesday was back to being what many municipal government forums often are \u2014 boring. There were no rants against Disney by the board's chairman nor demands by local opponents for board members appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to resign immediately. Instead, board members approved contracts for the installation of pipelines for chilled water, sediment removal, the replacement of a wastewater lift pump and the removal of compost waste. What made this meeting different from most during the past year or so was that it came a month after Disney and DeSantis' board appointees reached a deal to end their state court lawsuits over DeSantis' takeover of the district. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things, for the theme park resort. \u201cWe're doing the people's business,\u201d said Charbel Barakat, the board's vice chair. Not even a group of Disney supporters who regularly speak out against DeSantis' board appointees bothered to show up during the public comment period on Wednesday. Until last year's takeover of the governing district, it had been controlled for the entirety of its five decades by Disney supporters. The takeover by DeSantis and the Republican-led Legislature was sparked by Disney's opposition to Florida\u2019s so-called Don\u2019t Say Gay law, which bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. DeSantis championed the 2022 law and repeatedly took shots at Disney in speeches until he suspended his presidential campaign. Lawsuits in federal and state courts followed. The state lawsuits have been dismissed, and the federal lawsuit is on hold pending further negotiations over agreements between Disney and the DeSantis appointees. During Wednesday's board meeting, the only reference to the lawsuits was a housekeeping matter that resulted from the deal. Board members approved an amendment to a labor services agreement, shortening it to 2028 instead of 2032. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter : @MikeSchneiderAP.",

            "content": "LONDON -- TikTok said Wednesday that it's halting a feature on its new app rewarding users in Europe for watching videos, after facing pressure from regulators worried about its addictive features. The company backed down days after the European Union warned that the TikTok Lite app might have breached the 27-nation bloc's digital regulations when it launched earlier this month. The EU's executive Commission threatened to order the suspension of features that pose a risk to kids. \u201cTikTok always seeks to engage constructively with the EU Commission and other regulators,\" it said in a post on social media platform X. \"We are therefore voluntarily suspending the rewards functions in TikTok Lite while we address the concerns that they have raised.\u201d TikTok Lite, which was rolled out in France and Spain , is a slimmed-down version of the main TikTok app that lets users earn rewards.

EU officials warned earlier this week that TikTok could face an order as early as Thursday to suspend the reward features.

            "date": "2024-04-24 09:20:00",
            "content": "LONDON -- British competition regulators said Wednesday they'll scrutinize recent artificial intelligence deals by Microsoft and Amazon over concerns that the moves could thwart competition in the AI industry. The Competition and Markets Authority said it's looking into Microsoft's partnership with France's Mistral AI and the company's hiring of key staff from another startup, Inflection AI. The watchdog also separately announced that it's investigating Amazon's $4 billion investment in San Francisco-based Anthropic. Big Tech companies have been pouring money into generative AI startups amid growing public and business interest in the technology, but the investments have also drawn attention from antitrust authorities. The U.K. watchdog said it was seeking comments from \u201cinterested third parties,\" before deciding whether to carry out an in-depth antitrust investigation. \"We will assess, objectively and impartially, whether each of these three deals fall within U.K. merger rules and, if they do, whether they have any impact on competition in the U.K.,\" the watchdog\u2019s executive director of mergers, Joel Bamford, said in a statement. Microsoft said it will provide the watchdog with the information it needs to carry out its inquiries. \u201cWe remain confident that common business practices such as the hiring of talent or making a\u202ffractional\u202finvestment in an AI\u202fstart-up\u202fpromote\u202fcompetition and are\u202fnot the same as\u202fa merger, the company said. Microsoft last month hired Mustafa Suleyman, who co-founded Google\u2019s DeepMind AI research lab, to head up its consumer artificial intelligence business, along with the chief scientist and several top engineers and researchers from Inflection, his AI startup. Microsoft also teamed up earlier this year with Mistral, which has become France's AI darling after being founded only last year. That followed Microsoft's previous existing partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is also facing scrutiny from the CMA. Mistral said it's \u201cfully committed to cooperating with the CMA throughout this process to ensure that our long-term independence and access to the market are upheld.\u201d Amazon, meanwhile, has spent billions for a minority stake in Anthropic. The two companies are collaborating to develop so-called foundation models, which underpin the generative AI systems that have captured global attention. \u201cIt's unprecedented for the CMA to review a collaboration of this type,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cUnlike partnerships between other AI startups and large technology companies, our collaboration with Anthropic includes a limited investment, doesn\u2019t give Amazon a board director or observer role, and continues to have Anthropic running its models on multiple cloud providers.\u201d The CMA said it's stepping up its scrutiny of the market for foundation models after it published a report that highlighted the risk that powerful companies could use partnerships with key AI players to strengthen their positions.",

            "content": "BRUSSELS -- The European Union announced on Wednesday an investigation into whether China is using unfair methods to deprive companies in Europe of access to its market for medical devices ranging from hypodermic needles to high-tech scanners. The probe launched by the European Commission \u2014 the EU\u2019s executive branch as well as its trade and competition watchdog \u2014 is the latest attempt to help companies gain the kind of access to China\u2019s vast markets that Chinese firms enjoy in Europe. \u201cOpenness is vital for businesses to thrive, for consumers, and to spur innovation worldwide,\u201d commission trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement. \u201cWe are launching this investigation with China so that we can achieve a level playing field in our procurement markets for producers of medical devices, on both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cRegrettably, our repeated discussions with China on this trade irritant have been fruitless.\u201d Should it fail to resolve the issue, Brussels could restrict the access of Chinese buyers, goods and services to the EU market. It says Chinese exports of medical devices to Europe surged more than 100% between 2015 and 2023. The commission said it has gathered evidence indicating that China\u2019s market has gradually closed to European firms and products made in the EU. It asserts that measures introduced by China \u201cunfairly differentiate\u201d between local and foreign companies. It did not quantify the effects on European businesses. France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are among the countries worst hit, the commission said, but it added that the medical device market is so big that many large companies and thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises around Europe might be suffering unfair treatment. The first step in the investigation \u2014 which could take from nine to 14 months to complete \u2014 will be for the commission to send a list of questions to Chinese authorities. The commission is hopeful that no action will be needed. It says the main aim is to win fair treatment for all sides. \u201cOur expectation is that China\u2019s market for public procurement will be as open to us as ours is to them. Simple. Nothing more, nothing less,\u201d spokesman Olof Gill told reporters. But China\u2019s foreign ministry said the EU move smacked of protectionism. \u201cThe EU has always touted itself as the most open market worldwide, but what we see now is that it is gradually moving towards protectionism,\u201d ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. \u201cWe urge the EU to adhere to its commitment to the open market and the principle of fair competition, abide by WTO (World Trade Organization) rules, and stop unwarrantedly suppressing and restricting Chinese companies on various pretexts,\u201d he said. ___ Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.",

            "title": "The summer after Barbenheimer and the strikes, Hollywood charts a new course",
            "date": "2024-04-24 10:13:00",
            "content": "\u201c Barbenheimer \u201d is a hard act to follow. But as Hollywood enters another summer movie season, armed with fewer superheroes and a landscape vastly altered by the strikes, it\u2019s worth remembering the classic William Goldman quote about what works: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d Four decades later, that still may be true. Yet one thing Hollywood has learned in releasing films through the pandemic and the strikes is how to pivot quickly. The summer of 2023 brought a new enthusiasm for moviegoing, with the fortuitous counterprogramming of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201c Oppenheimer,\u201d and surprise hits like \u201c Sound of Freedom,\u201d helping the season\u2019s box office crack $4 billion for the first time since 2019. But before the industry could take a victory lap, there was another crisis looming with the dual Hollywood strikes, which shuttered most productions for months. In the fallout, theaters lost big summer titles like \u201cMission: Impossible 8,\u201d \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d and \u201cThunderbolts\u201d to 2025. But they gained a gem in Jeff Nichols\u2019 \u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d (June 21), about a 1960s Midwestern motorcycle club, as studios moved films around on the summer chessboard. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d once set to kick off the summer moviegoing season on May 3 like many Marvel movies before it, is now sitting happily on July 26, patiently waiting to dominate the summer charts. \u201cI do love being right there in the belly of summer,\u201d said director Shawn Levy. \u201cThat\u2019s a juicy moment.\u201d The kickoff weekend instead belongs to an original film about a different kind of superhero. \u201c The Fall Guy,\u201d starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, is part romantic-comedy, part action-comedy, and all love letter to the stunt performers that make movies spectacular. It\u2019s an earnest crowd-pleaser that could jumpstart a season that feels, in some ways, like a throwback, with full-throttle spectacles (\u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,\u201d \u201cTwisters\u201d), comedies (\u201cBabes\"), IMAX wonder (\u201cThe Blue Angels\u201d) and even a Kevin Costner Western. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has seen the highs and lows of summer movies over the decades, with blockbusters including \u201c Top Gun: Maverick \u201d and the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movies. This season, he has three very different offerings on the calendar, two are fourth installments in popular franchises \u2014 \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d (July 3, Netflix) and \u201cBad Boys\u201d (June 7, theaters) \u2014 and one was planned for streaming but tested so well that it\u2019s getting a theatrical rollout (\u201cYoung Woman and the Sea,\u201d May 31). \u201cPeople just want to be entertained,\u201d Bruckheimer said. \u201cIt really comes down to us to make the right movies that they want to go see.\u201d A Hollywood summer lasts 123 days from the first Friday in May through Labor Day Monday in September. Pre-pandemic, $4 billion was a normal summer intake and theaters could count on anywhere between 37 and 42 films to open on over 2,000 screens. The outlier was 2017, which had only 35 movies on over 2,000 screens and topped out at $3.8 billion. It makes last summer\u2019s $4 billion haul with 32 wide releases (45% of the $9 billion domestic haul) even more impressive. This summer should have 32 wide releases as well and over 40 movies opening in 500+ theaters. Notably only two of them are Marvel movies (\u201cDeadpool\u201d and Sony\u2019s \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d) and are the only superhero movies on the calendar until the \u201cJoker\u201d sequel in the fall. \u201cPeople are going to see movies, not box office, and it looks like a really solid summer from a moviegoer's perspective,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d was one that planned for an awards season rollout, with a turbo boost from stellar reviews out of the Telluride Film Festival hailing star turns for Austin Butler and Jodie Comer. But as they inched closer to its release date it became clear that the strikes were not going to resolve in time for a press tour. \u201cIt was kind of like walking on frozen glass for three months,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cI was touring around doing press and trying to build this energy on my own. Let me tell you, it\u2019s not the same as Austin Butler.\u201d Later in June, after a splashy Cannes debut, Kevin Costner will begin rolling out his two-part Western epic \u201cHorizon: An American Saga,\u201d set during the Civil War. And as always there are a slew of Sundance breakouts peppered throughout the summer, from Jane Shoenbrun\u2019s \u201cI Saw the TV Glow\u201d and \u201cDidi\u201d to \u201c Thelma \u201d and \u201cGood One.\u201d Family films often go into hyperdrive in the summer, capitalizing on long days out of school. This year has plenty, like \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d and \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d re-releases of Studio Ghibli classics, and streaming options (\u201cThelma the Unicorn\u201d). But perhaps none has more anticipation behind it than \u201cInside Out 2\u201d (June 14, theaters), which meets up with Riley as she enters her teenage years as a new group of emotions crash Joy\u2019s party, including Anxiety, Envy, Ennui and Embarrassment. \u201cThat age gives us everything we need and love for a Pixar film,\u201d director Kelsey Mann said. \u201cIt\u2019s full of drama, it has potential for a lot of heart, and I could also make it really funny.\u201d John Krasinski is also delving into the inner world of children with his ambitious live-action hybrid \u201cIF\u201d (May 17, theaters) about the imaginary friends that get left behind and two humans (Ryan Reynolds and Cailey Fleming) who can still see them. Audiences seeking the adrenaline rush of horrors and thrillers have plenty of choices, including \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d the conclusion to Ti West\u2019s accidental Mia Goth trilogy (\u201cX\u201d and \u201c Pearl \u201d) that debuts around the fourth of July. Goth\u2019s aspiring actress has made her way to Hollywood where a killer is stalking Hollywood starlets around the time of the home video boom of the 1980s. \u201cWe recreated the sleazy side of Hollywood in a hopefully charming way,\u201d West said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a pretty wild night at the movies. A big, rockin\u2019, fun movie.\u201d On June 26, audiences can also delve into the beginnings of \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d with a prequel set on \u201cDay One\u201d starring Luptia Nyong\u2019o and \u201cStranger Things\u2019\u201d Joseph Quinn. Director Michael Sarnoski said they wanted to explore the \u201cscope and promise\u201d of a Quiet Place movie in New York. Later, Fede \u00c1lvarez brings his horror acumen to \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d (Aug. 16), set between the first two. M. Night Shyamalan is back as well with a thriller set at a pop concert (\u201cTrap,\u201d Aug. 9) and his daughter, Ishana Night Shyamalan, makes her directorial debut with the spooky, Ireland-set \u201cThe Watchers\u201d (June 14) with Dakota Fanning. \u201cIt's very suspenseful and unexpected,\u201d Ishana said. \"And it's very much built for the experience of being in a theater.\u201d Much to the chagrin of theater owners, big summer movies have also existed off the big screen for years now. And the streamers have movie stars and spectacle with the festival favorite \u201cHit Man,\u201d the Anne Hathaway romance \u201cThe Idea of You,\u201d Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s starry pop-tart movie \u201cUnfrosted\u201d and a Mark Wahlberg/Halle Berry action comedy \u201cThe Union.\u201d They have franchises too: \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d (July 3) was a movie that was in and out of development since the mid-1990s, but got new life when Paramount licensed the rights to Netflix. \u201cWe raised our hand to make sure we got the franchise right and kept the integrity and fun of the original,\u201d Bruckheimer said. This installment adds an emotional component in which Eddie Murphy\u2019s Axel Foley reunites with his estranged daughter (Taylour Paige). It also sees the return of Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser and Bronson Pinchot and adds Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On Aug. 9, Apple TV+ will also have \u201cThe Instigators,\u201d a new action-comedy starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck as normal guys attempting a heist. \u201cMidnight Run\u201d was one of their touchstones. \u201cThe script was so funny and I wanted to really embrace that,\u201d Doug Liman, who directed, said. Remember, anything can happen with summer movies. We can pretend we knew that \u201cBarbie\u201d would be the biggest movie of the year, but would anyone have bet that an R-rated drama about the father of the atomic bomb would have made almost three times as much as Harrison Ford\u2019s last ride as Indiana Jones? Or that a $14 million crowdfunded movie from a new studio about child trafficking with next to zero promotion would earn over $250 million? \u201cNobody knows anything is right,\u201d said \u201cThe Instigators\u201d producer Kevin Walsh. \u201cThe movie business is so unpredictable. You never know what\u2019s going to work and what isn\u2019t. But you have your taste. And following your taste and your instincts in this business is paramount.\u201d ___ For interviews, reviews and more coverage of recent film releases, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/movies",

            "title": "Senate passes bill forcing TikTok's parent company to sell or face ban, sends to Biden for signature",
            "date": "2024-04-23 21:42:00",
            "content": "WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed legislation Tuesday that would force TikTok \u2019s China -based parent company to sell the social media platform under the threat of a ban, a contentious move by U.S. lawmakers that\u2019s expected to face legal challenges and disrupt the lives of content creators who rely on the short-form video app for income. The TikTok legislation was included as part of a larger $95 billion package that provides foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel and was passed 79-18. It now goes to President Joe Biden , who said in a statement immediately after passage that he will sign it Wednesday. A decision made by House Republicans last week to attach the TikTok bill to the high-priority package helped expedite its passage in Congress and came after negotiations with the Senate, where an earlier version of the bill had stalled. That version had given TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, six months to divest its stakes in the platform. But it drew skepticism from some key lawmakers concerned it was too short of a window for a complex deal that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. The revised legislation extends the deadline, giving ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok, and a possible three-month extension if a sale is in progress. The bill would also bar the company from controlling TikTok\u2019s secret sauce: the algorithm that feeds users videos based on their interests and has made the platform a trendsetting phenomenon. TikTok did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday night. The passage of the legislation is a culmination of long-held bipartisan fears in Washington over Chinese threats and the ownership of TikTok, which is used by 170 million Americans. For years, lawmakers and administration officials have expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data, or influence Americans by suppressing or promoting certain content on TikTok. \u201cCongress is not acting to punish ByteDance, TikTok or any other individual company,\" Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell said. \"Congress is acting to prevent foreign adversaries from conducting espionage, surveillance, maligned operations, harming vulnerable Americans, our servicemen and women, and our U.S. government personnel.\u201d Opponents of the bill say the Chinese government could easily get information on Americans in other ways, including through commercial data brokers that traffic in personal information. The foreign aid package includes a provision that makes it illegal for data brokers to sell or rent \u201cpersonally identifiable sensitive data\u201d to North Korea, China, Russia, Iran or entities in those countries. But it has encountered some pushback, including from the American Civil Liberties Union, which says the language is written too broadly and could sweep in journalists and others who publish personal information. Many opponents of the TikTok measure argue the best way to protect U.S. consumers is through implementing a comprehensive federal data privacy law that targets all companies regardless of their origin. They also note the U.S. has not provided public evidence that shows TikTok sharing U.S. user information with Chinese authorities, or that Chinese officials have ever tinkered with its algorithm. \u201cBanning TikTok would be an extraordinary step that requires extraordinary justification,\u201d said Becca Branum, a deputy director at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology, which advocates for digital rights. \u201cExtending the divestiture deadline neither justifies the urgency of the threat to the public nor addresses the legislation\u2019s fundamental constitutional flaws.\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat who voted for the legislation, said he has concerns about TikTok, but he's also worried the bill could have negative effects on free speech, doesn't do enough to protect consumer privacy and could potentially be abused by a future administration to violate First Amendment rights. \u201cI plan to watchdog how this legislation is implemented,\u201d Wyden said in a statement. China has previously said it would oppose a forced sale of TikTok, and has signaled its opposition this time around. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a security threat, is also preparing a lawsuit to block the legislation. \u201cAt the stage that the bill is signed, we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,\u201d Michael Beckerman, TikTok\u2019s head of public policy for the Americas, wrote in a memo sent to employees on Saturday and obtained by The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the beginning, not the end of this long process,\" Beckerman wrote. The company has seen some success with court challenges in the past, but it has never sought to prevent federal legislation from going into effect. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued. Three years before that, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights. The Trump administration then brokered a deal that had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. But the sale never went through. Trump, who is running for president again this year, now says he opposes the potential ban. Since then, TikTok has been in negotiations about its future with the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a little-known government agency tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns. On Sunday, Erich Andersen, a top attorney for ByteDance who led talks with the U.S. government for years, told his team that he was stepping down from his role. \u201cAs I started to reflect some months ago on the stresses of the last few years and the new generation of challenges that lie ahead, I decided that the time was right to pass the baton to a new leader,\u201d Andersen wrote in an internal memo that was obtained by the AP. He said the decision to step down was entirely his and was decided months ago in a discussion with the company\u2019s senior leaders. Meanwhile, TikTok content creators who rely on the app have been trying to make their voices heard. Earlier Tuesday, some creators congregated in front the Capitol building to speak out against the bill and carry signs that read \u201cI\u2019m 1 of the 170 million Americans on TikTok,\" among other things. Tiffany Cianci, a content creator who has more than 140,000 followers on the platform and had encouraged people to show up, said she spent Monday night picking up creators from airports in the D.C. area. Some came from as far as Nevada and California. Others drove overnight from South Carolina or took a bus from upstate New York. Cianci says she believes TikTok is the safest platform for users right now because of Project Texas, TikTok's $1.5 billion mitigation plan to store U.S. user data on servers owned and maintained by the tech giant Oracle. \u201cIf our data is not safe on TikTok,\" she said. \u201cI would ask why the president is on TikTok.\u201d __ Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Matt O'Brien contributed to this report.",

            "title": "TikTok may be banned in the US. Here's what happened when India did it",
            "date": "2024-04-24 05:52:00",
            "content": "NEW DELHI -- The hugely popular Chinese app TikTok may be forced out of the U.S., where a measure to outlaw the video-sharing app has won congressional approval and is on its way to President Biden for his signature. In India, the app was banned nearly four years ago. Here's what happened: In June 2020, TikTok users in India bid goodbye to the app, which is operated by Chinese internet firm ByteDance. New Delhi had suddenly banned the popular app, alongside dozens other Chinese apps, following a military clash along the India-China border. Twenty Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed, and ties between the two Asian giants plunged to a new low. The government cited privacy concerns and said that Chinese apps pose a threat to India\u2019s sovereignty and security. The move mostly drew widespread support in India, where protesters had been calling for a boycott of Chinese goods since the deadly confrontation in the remote Karakoram mountain border region. \u201cThere was a clamour leading up to this, and the popular narrative was how can we allow Chinese companies to do business in India when we\u2019re in the middle of a military standoff,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy expert and founder of tech website MediaNama. Just months before the ban, India had also restricted investment from Chinese companies, Pahwa added. \u201cTikTok wasn\u2019t a one-off case. Today, India has banned over 500 Chinese apps to date.\u201d At the time, India had about 200 million TikTok users. And the company also employed thousands of Indians. TikTok users and content creators, however, needed a place to go \u2014 and the ban provided a multi-billion dollar opportunity to snatch up a big market. Within months, Google rolled out YouTube Shorts and Instagram pushed out its Reels feature. Both mimicked the short-form video creation that TikTok had excelled at. \u201cAnd they ended up capturing most of the market that TikTok had vacated,\u201d said Pahwa. In India, TikTok content was hyperlocal, which made it quite unique. It opened a window into the lives of small-town India, with videos coming from tier 2 and 3 cities that showed people doing tricks while laying down bricks, for example. But for the most part, content creators and users in the four years since the ban have moved on to other platforms. Winnie Sangma misses posting videos on TikTok and earning a bit of money. But after the ban, he migrated to Instagram and now has 15,000 followers. The process, for the most part, has been relatively painless. \u201cI have built up followers on Instagram too, and I am making money from it, but the experience isn\u2019t like how it used to be on TikTok,\u201d he said. Rajib Dutta, a frequent scroller on TikTok, also switched to Instagram after the ban. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a big deal,\u201d he said. The legislation to outlaw the app has won congressional approval and now awaits a signature from Biden. The measure gives ByteDance, the app\u2019s parent company, nine months to sell it, and three more if a sale is underway. If this doesn\u2019t happen, TikTok will be banned. It would take at least a year before a ban goes into effect, but with likely court challenges, it could stretch longer. In India, the ban in 2020 was swift. TikTok and other companies were given time to respond to questions on privacy and security, and by January 2021, it became a permanent ban. But the situation in the U.S. is different, said Pahwa. \u201cIn India, TikTok decided not to go to court, but the U.S. is a bigger revenue market for them. Also, the First Amendment in America is fairly strong, so it\u2019s not going to be as easy for the U.S. to do this as it was for India,\u201d he said, in reference to free speech rights in the U.S. Constitution. As Chinese apps proliferate across the world, Pahwa says countries need to assess their dependency on China and develop a way to reduce it as the apps can pose a national security risk. The app is also banned in Pakistan, Nepal and Afghanistan and restricted in many countries in Europe. \u201cChinese intelligence law and its cybersecurity law can allow Chinese apps to work in the interest of their own security. That creates a situation of distrust and it becomes a national security risk for others,\u201d said Pahwa. \u201cThere should be different rules for democratic countries and for authoritarian regimes where companies can act as an extension of the state,\u201d he added. \u2014- This story corrects the expert's erroneous reference to Fourth instead of First Amendment.",

I think a lot of pride comes along with it, not just recognizing the Olympic achievement, but also being recognized during AAPI Month and following in the footsteps of some incredible women that I idolize \u2014 Anna May Wong, Maya Angelou and Rosa Parks,\u201d Yamaguchi told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's hard to see me put in the category with them.\u201d Yamaguchi, who became the first Asian American to win an individual figure skating gold medal, at the 1992 Winter Olympics , has been immortalized as a doll for Barbie's \u201cInspiring Women Series,\u201d Mattel announced Wednesday. The release is timed for Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, in May. This isn't Yamaguchi's first doll depiction. In the '90s, touring show Stars on Ice put out a line of dolls modeled after notable skaters. The Barbie version is a lot more detailed. Mattel duplicated everything the then 20-year-old medalist wore at the Olympics in Albertville, France: the sparkling black-and-gold brocade outfit designed by Lauren Sheehan, the gold hair ribbon and even a red-and-white bouquet like Yamaguchi held atop the podium. Yamaguchi said both she and Sheehan are \u201cjust so tickled pink.\" She also is happy with the doll's visage. \u201cIt looks like me for sure. You know, the eyes and just the shape of the face. And then, of course, the hair, for sure. I mean, it has the bangs that are the '90s,\u201d Yamaguchi said, chuckling. She appreciates that the doll's release comes on the high heels of the blockbuster \u201cBarbie\u201d movie last year. Her daughters, ages 18 and 20, are fans of the Oscar-nominated film. Their initial reaction to their mother being a Barbie? Disbelief. \u201cWhen they found out I was getting a doll, they were kind of flabbergasted and being like, \u2018What? Like Mom, like how do you qualify? But that\u2019s way too cool for you,\u2019\u201d Yamaguchi said. When Yamaguchi became a household name in the '90s, most Asian American children were growing up feeling like toys-aren\u2019t-us kids. If you were an Asian parent looking for an Asian doll in the U.S., you likely turned to independent mail-order companies or waited until you were visiting your country of heritage. Since then, the toy market has evolved somewhat with big companies like Mattel diversifying and independent entrepreneurs filling the void. Two Asian doll lines \u2014 Jilly Bing and Joeydolls \u2014 launched within the last year, one by an Asian American mother and the other by an Asian Canadian mother. Both could not find dolls that looked like their daughters. Sapna Cheryan, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington who served a year on Mattel's Barbie Global Advisory Council in 2018, said Asian Americans have long dealt with two stereotypes: the model-minority whiz kid or the perpetual foreigner. Toys can help dispel those myths, and instead signal acceptance and inclusivity. Dolls modeled after real people can get people talking about their human counterparts. Cheryan applauded Barbie's choice of Yamaguchi. \u201cThere are so many Asian American athletes but they\u2019re just not propped up in a way that athletes of other racial groups are,\" said Cheryan, who researches cultural stereotypes and their impact on race and gender disparities. \u201cHaving a match in terms of racial identification or gender or both,\" she said, is important in creating effective role models for kids. Mattel has mostly garnered praise for its diversity efforts but it's had some missteps along the way. In 2021, the toy maker said it \u201cfell short\u201d by failing to include an Asian doll in a line of Tokyo Olympics-themed Barbies. In January, there was some backlash to Asian \u201cYou Can Be Anything\u201d Barbies that seemed stereotypical. One was a violinist and the other a doctor in panda scrubs. Tying Yamaguchi to Barbie, a symbol of American pop culture, is especially remarkable considering what she and her family have dealt with as Japan ese Americans. She has spoken about how her maternal and paternal grandparents were forced into U.S. incarceration camps in response to Japan's 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. When she captured the gold over 50 years later, media coverage partially focused on why she didn't seem to have many endorsement deals. In an AP article from 1992, a sports advertising executive blamed her Japanese heritage, citing an economic climate that was anti-Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, wrong, wrong, but that is the way it is,\u201d the executive said. So while Barbie may seem like just a toy, it's so much more for Yamaguchi. \u201cWhen kids see themselves or see someone who inspires them, then it just opens up their world and their imagination to what\u2019s possible,\" she said. ___ Tang is a Phoenix-based member of AP\u2019s Race and Ethnicity team.

            "date": "2024-04-23 20:12:00",
            "content": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that samples of pasteurized milk had tested positive for remnants of the bird flu virus that has infected dairy cows. The agency stressed that the material is inactivated and that the findings \u201cdo not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers.\u201d Officials added that they're continuing to study the issue. \u201cTo date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\u201d the FDA said in a statement. The announcement comes nearly a month after an avian influenza virus that has sickened millions of wild and commercial birds in recent years was detected in dairy cows in at least eight states. The Agriculture Department says 33 herds have been affected to date. FDA officials didn't indicate how many samples they tested or where they were obtained. The agency has been evaluating milk during processing and from grocery stores, officials said. Results of additional tests are expected in \u201cthe next few days to weeks.\u201d The PCR lab test the FDA used would have detected viral genetic material even after live virus was killed by pasteurization, or heat treatment, said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University \u201cThere is no evidence to date that this is infectious virus and the FDA is following up on that,\u201d Jaykus said. Officials with the FDA and the USDA had previously said milk from affected cattle did not enter the commercial supply. Milk from sick animals is supposed to be diverted and destroyed. Federal regulations require milk that enters interstate commerce to be pasteurized. Because the detection of the bird flu virus known as Type A H5N1 in dairy cattle is new and the situation is evolving, no studies on the effects of pasteurization on the virus have been completed, FDA officials said. But past research shows that pasteurization is \u201cvery likely\u201d to inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1, the agency added. Matt Herrick, a spokesman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said that time and temperature regulations for pasteurization ensure that the commercial U.S. milk supply is safe. Remnants of the virus \u201chave zero impact on human health,\u201d he wrote in an email. Scientists confirmed the H5N1 virus in dairy cows in March after weeks of reports that cows in Texas were suffering from a mysterious malady. The cows were lethargic and saw a dramatic reduction in milk production. Although the H5N1 virus is lethal to commercial poultry, most infected cattle seem to recover within two weeks, experts said. To date, two people in U.S. have been infected with bird flu. A Texas dairy worker who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

            "title": "What a TikTok ban in the US could mean for you",
            "date": "2024-04-23 22:28:00",
            "content": "No, TikTok will not suddenly disappear from your phone. Nor will you go to jail if you continue using it after it is banned. After years of attempts to ban the Chinese-owned app, including by former President Donald Trump, a measure to outlaw the popular video-sharing app has won congressional approval and is on its way to President Biden for his signature. The measure gives Beijing-based parent company ByteDance nine months to sell the company, with a possible additional three months if a sale is in progress. If it doesn't, TikTok will be banned. So what does this mean for you, a TikTok user, or perhaps the parent of a TikTok user? Here are some key questions and answers. The original proposal gave ByteDance just six months to divest from its U.S. subsidiary, negotiations lengthened it to nine. Then, if the sale is already in progress, the company will get another three months to complete it. So it would be at least a year before a ban goes into effect \u2014 but with likely court challenges, this could stretch even longer, perhaps years. TikTok has seen some success with court challenges in the past, but it has never sought to prevent federal legislation from going into effect. TikTok, which is used by more than 170 million Americans, most likely won't disappear from your phone even if an eventual ban does take effect. But it would disappear from Apple and Google's app stores, which means users won't be able to download it. This would also mean that TikTok wouldn't be able to send updates, security patches and bug fixes, and over time the app would likely become unusable \u2014 not to mention a security risk. Teenagers are known for circumventing parental controls and bans when it comes to social media, so dodging the U.S. government's ban is certainly not outside the realm of possibilities. For instance, users could try to mask their location using a VPN, or virtual private network, use alternative app stores or even install a foreign SIM card into their phone. But some tech savvy is required, and it's not clear what will and won't work. More likely, users will migrate to another platform \u2014 such as Instagram, which has a TikTok-like feature called Reels, or YouTube , which has incorporated vertical short videos in its feed to try to compete with TikTok. Often, such videos are taken directly from TikTok itself. And popular creators are likely to be found on other platforms as well, so you'll probably be able to see the same stuff. \u201cThe TikTok bill relies heavily on the control that Apple and Google maintain over their smartphone platforms because the bill\u2019s primary mechanism is to direct Apple and Google to stop allowing the TikTok app on their respective app stores,\u201d said Dean Ball, a research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \u201cSuch a mechanism might be much less effective in the world envisioned by many advocates of antitrust and aggressive regulation against the large tech firms.\u201d Lawmakers from both parties \u2014 as well as law enforcement and intelligence officials \u2014 have long expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok. The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering - which ByteDance would likely be subject to \u2013 and other far-reaching ways the country\u2019s authoritarian government exercises control. Data privacy experts say, though, that the Chinese government could easily get information on Americans in other ways, including through commercial data brokers that sell or rent personal information. Lawmakers and some administration officials have also expressed concerns that China could - potentially \u2013 direct or influence ByteDance to suppress or boost TikTok content that are favorable to its interests. TikTok, for its part, has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government. The company has also said it has never shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities and won\u2019t do so if it\u2019s asked.",

            "date": "2024-04-23 06:30:00",
            "content": "ABC News is taking a look at solutions for issues related to climate change and the environment with the series \u201cThe Power of Us: People, The Climate, and Our Future.\u201d The natural diamond industry has been fueled by a glittering marketing strategy for decades, but is the sustainability of modern, lab-grown diamonds as clear-cut as consumers believe? Since De Beers Group's 1940s \"a diamond is forever\" advertising campaign, dubbed by Advertising Age as the \"slogan of the 20th century\" in 1999, the natural diamond industry exploded into a multi-billion-dollar industry and cemented itself into modern culture. \"Diamonds are very ingrained in our culture,\" Paul Zimnisky, a leading diamond industry analyst, told ABC News. \"I think, as humans, we just desire these rare, precious gemstones and metals. It's not practical, but it makes us feel good.\" MORE: Everything you need to know before buying a lab-grown diamond In 2022, the global natural diamond market was valued at $100.4 billion and is projected to reach $155.5 billion by 2032, according to Allied Market Research . In this Nov. 2, 2018, file photo, a Grown With Love Lab Grown Diamonds\u2122 ring is shown. Business Wire via AP, FILE However, the natural, mined diamond industry has been disrupted by a just as shiny and substantially less expensive competitor -- lab-grown diamonds. General Electric first produced lab-grown diamonds in 1954, according to the International Gem Society (IGS), using a high-pressure belt press to subject small seed crystals to temperatures of 2,912 Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressures of 100,000 atm. Over the next several decades, researchers in the United States, China and Russia adopted varied methods of the initial GE patent to create lab-grown diamonds that exceed mined, natural diamonds in carat size, color and clarity, according to IGS. Demand for lab-grown diamonds has increased every year but gained mainstream attention in 2017, according to Zimnisky. MORE: Diamonds are forever, but what about ones grown in labs? \"Production has just absolutely skyrocketed,\" Zimnisky said. \"The production technologies in the production capacity have rapidly advanced in just the last three, four years. And because of that, the cost of production is dropped, and the cost to the consumer has dropped.\" To the naked eye, lab-grown diamonds are identical to their mined counterparts but cost 40% to 50% less. A one-carat lab-grown diamond costs about $1,200, depending on quality, while a similar natural diamond can cost $4,200, according to The Diamond Pro . In 2022, the global lab-grown diamonds market was valued at $24 billion and is projected to reach $59.2 billion by 2032, according to Allied Market Research . How are lab-grown diamonds made? Lab-grown diamonds share identical chemical and physical properties with natural diamonds, Dr. Ulrika D\u2019Haenens-Johansson, Senior Manager of Diamond Research at the Gemological Institute of America, told ABC News, the difference is the origin in which they were made: In a lab vs. being mined after forming 150 miles below the Earth's surface. \"Laboratory-grown diamonds have the same composition and crystal structure as natural diamonds, resulting in essentially the same physical, chemical and optical properties,\" D\u2019Haenens-Johansson said. \"While laboratory-grown and natural diamonds may appear identical to the naked eye, they fundamentally differ in several ways: their age, the way that they grew, and the environment in which they formed.\" Lab-grown diamonds mimic the conditions natural diamonds are formed in, where carbon is compressed due to extreme temperatures and pressures. This photograph taken February 6, 2024 shows a laboratory technician monitoring the progress of lab-grown diamond seeds at Greenlab Diamonds manufacturing firm on the outskirts of Surat. Sam Panthaky/AFP via Getty Images The manufactured stones are created in two ways: through high pressure/high temperature (HPHT) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes, according to IGS. Both HPHT and CVD lab-grown diamond productions require recreating temperatures over 1,472 Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressures up to 70,000 atm, according to IGS. Are lab-grown diamonds sustainable? The variation in the production of lab-grown diamonds is where the sustainability of the man-made product comes into question, according to Zimnisky, who notes, \"Man-made diamonds require an enormous amount of energy.\" \"You could go to a producer that's using coal-fired, grid power, or a producer that's using hydropower or solar power,\" Zimnisky said. \"Obviously, the environmental impact is going to be different depending on the source of energy.\" The production of laboratory-grown diamonds is an energy-intensive process, according to D\u2019Haenens-Johansson, who notes, many -- if not most -- lab-grown diamond producers use electricity from fossil fuels such as coal. Additionally, D\u2019Haenens-Johansson explained that the raw materials that are used for lab-grown diamond growth, such as methane gas and graphite are \"generally intrinsically tied to mining processes.\" On average, producing one polished carat of lab-grown diamond releases approximately 511 kg of greenhouse gases, according to IGS.

MORE: Are lab-grown diamonds the real deal? \"India and China right now are by far the largest producers of the man-made diamond,\" Zimnisky said. \"I expect them to continue to be the largest producers.\" In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned eight jewelry marketers that some of their online advertisements of jewelry made with lab-grown diamonds \"may deceive consumers,\" in violation of the 2018 FTC Act -- updated Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries. According to the FTC press release , \"the companies in question advertised their jewelry as 'eco-friendly,' 'eco-conscious,' or 'sustainable,' and that such terms can be interpreted to imply certain specific environmental benefits.\" The FTC \"admonished\" the companies, saying it's \"highly unlikely that they can substantiate all reasonable interpretations of these claims,\" according to the release. Environmental and ethical impact of mined diamonds Mined diamonds are collected through open-pit, underground and marine mining, which can disrupt ecosystems and release carbon and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, according to IGS. Clean Origin compares the environmental footprint between mined and lab-grown diamonds, claiming one carat of mined diamond equates to nearly 100 square feet of disturbed land and nearly 6,000 pounds of mineral waste. Meanwhile, one carat of lab-grown diamond disrupts just 0.07 square feet of land and results in 1 pound of mineral waste, according to Clean Origin.

Rebel groups used forced labor in lucrative diamond mining war zones to finance armed conflicts, which led to widespread human rights abuse, according to Britannica. In 2003, the Kimberly Process was enacted to stop the illegal trade of conflict diamonds and protect the legitimate diamond trade, according to Britannica , which notes the agreement involves 49 participating countries including the European Union. Why brands and consumers believe in lab-grown diamonds Alexander Weindling, a third-generation diamond jeweler and CEO of Clean Origin, a completely lab-grown diamond company, told ABC News the ethos and affordability of lab-grown diamonds motivate his business. Weindlings says a one-carat mined diamond can retail for $4,000 or $5,000, while Clean Origin offers what appears to be an identical stone for under $1,000.

Instead of cheaply made knockoffs, the latest crop of counterfeit handbags, known as \"superfakes,\" looks very similar to the authentic luxury item. As high-end luxury brands including Hermes, Chanel, and Prada have boosted their prices in recent years, many consumers turned to deceivingly high-quality replicas for a fraction of the price. The precision and attention to detail put into making replica handbags have made it easier for them to pass off as genuine luxury products, with hardly any noticeable differences to the untrained eye.

Luxury goods are the most commonly counterfeited items. Last fiscal year, Russo\u2019s team seized nearly 23 million counterfeit goods nationwide worth over $2 billion in estimated retail value, calculated as if they were authentic. Even some celebrities have been sporting the superfake merchandise. \"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City'' star Jen Shah made headlines when federal agents seized dozens of counterfeit handbags found in her possession, after her arrest in 2021 for a telemarketing fraud scheme. Despite counterfeit sellers conducting business publicly, law enforcement said it\u2019s difficult to crack down on their activity. ABC News contacted over 50 sellers based in China. While most declined to respond, one seller disclosed that the operation is often exceedingly discreet, with each link of the process isolated from the others. Buying, however, is an easier process. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amy X. Wang, assistant managing editor for the New York Times Magazine, reported on the superfake industry. \u201cIt's not really a secretive process,\u201d said Wang, \u201c[It\u2019s] almost disappointingly easy,\u201d Wang said. Wang discovered an online ecosystem of replica handbags that paralleled luxury brands, making counterfeit goods easily accessible. On Reddit forums such as \u201cr/Wagoonladies,\u201d interested buyers can find detailed purchase guides, thorough customer reviews, and contact lists for sellers primarily based in China. \"Some people think it's an embarrassing secret,\" Wang said. \"But to the other people, it's fun. It's subversive. It's actually really edgy that they have a fake bag maybe.\u201d Despite the increased prevalence of counterfeit luxury goods, authentic luxury brands continue to be solid investments. Resale data from Rebag indicates that popular styles from brands such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Hermes are being resold second-hand for prices higher than their original purchase price.

When CBP was asked for evidence linking counterfeits to terrorism in the U.S., they cited the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center as an example. Additionally, they asserted that \"other terrorist organizations have engaged in the sale of counterfeit goods and stolen cultural artifacts to help fund their organization.\" Terrorists responsible for the 2015 terror attack in France on employees of the magazine Charlie Hebdo financed their weapons partly by selling fake Nike sneakers, according to authorities.

And that's how we scale our investigations.\" ABC News' Aria Young contributed to this report",

            "title": "Why is Trump's Truth Social stock plummeting?",
            "date": "2024-04-16 12:25:00",
            "content": "Shares of Truth Social soared after the company\u2019s market debut last month -- but the stock price has plummeted since then. After vaulting from an initial offering price of about $50 to a peak of nearly $80 in late March, the share price has dropped a staggering 68%. In early trading on Tuesday, the price stood at about $25. The sharp decline traces primarily to the company\u2019s status as a so-called meme stock, which appeals to investors on the basis of ideology rather than financial outlook, experts told ABC News. Since Truth Social suffers continued losses and lacks a path to profitability, the stock risks selloffs on even mildly negative news, they said. \u201cThe political hope is meeting a financial reality,\u201d Tyler Richey, an analyst at Sevens Report Research, told ABC News. Truth Social did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. The stock performance holds significant financial implications for former President Donald Trump, whose 60% stake in the company could ultimately deliver a multi-billion dollar windfall. Truth Social shares make up a large portion of Trump\u2019s overall net worth, according to Fortune . During its initial days on the market, the stock rallied . The price climbed 16% on the company\u2019s first day of listing and another 14% on its second. That growth granted Truth Social a valuation of more than $8 billion, even though the company has yet to turn a profit and generates quarterly revenue of barely $1 million. \u201cThe valuation is just astronomical,\u201d Richey said. \u201cSo it\u2019s coming back to Earth.\u201d Truth Social, listed as ticker DJT, remains far smaller and less financially robust than its rivals in the crowded social media sector. Research firm SimilarWeb estimates the company drew 5 million website visitors in February, which puts it well below the roughly 2 billion monthly active users reported by Instagram. TikTok boasts at least 1 billion monthly active users, the company said in 2021. Truth Social generated roughly $3 million over the first nine months of 2023, government filings show. Meanwhile, the company reported $49 million in net losses over that period. By comparison, Instagram-parent Meta delivered nearly $135 billion in revenue last year, company earnings revealed . \u201cTruth Social is not attracting and holding users and it\u2019s not attracting significant advertising revenue,\u201d Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News. \u201cIts current business model is a colossal failure.\u201d The download screen for Truth Social app is seen on a laptop computer, March 20, 2024, in New York. John Minchillo/AP, FILE The absence of financial underpinning leaves the stock vulnerable to major declines even in response to mildly negative or routine news, experts said. Related Stories Secret Service prepares for Trump in contempt Apr 23, 4:16 PM NASA identifies space object that hit Florida home Apr 16, 4:06 PM Top 3 takeaways from Day 6 of Trump's NY trial Apr 23, 6:43 PM On Monday, the company released a government filing meant to formally establish millions of shares owned by Donald Trump and other investors. Investors holding shares in the pre-merger company that took Truth Social public could eventually convert those holdings into shares of Truth Social, the filing said. The routine filing did not increase the number of outstanding shares but it still raised alarm among some investors for the potential to do so, Ritter said. \u201cThis was going to happen sooner or later,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cIn that regard, it wasn\u2019t really news.\u201d The filing appeared to send the stock price tumbling. Shares of Truth Social fell 18% on Monday. When traders buy into a stock for non-financial reasons, moments of risk can turn into a collapse, in part because opportunistic traders abandon the stock on the way down, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s a domino effect,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cSelling led to more selling.\u201d The stock difficulty has coincided with financial challenges for Trump. Earlier this month, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee posted a $175 million bond in a New York civil fraud case. Trump can\u2019t sell or leverage his stake in Truth Social for at least six months due to a lockup provision intended to prevent a rapid selloff that could shake investor confidence. Supporters of Trump could seek to reverse the company\u2019s declining stock price, Richey said. \u201cYou may have some die-hard supporters come in and support the stock,\u201d Richey said, noting that such a move could elicit a response from skeptics of Trump or the company. \u201cIn this political environment, there\u2019s just as many people that would bet against the stock as would be for it,\u201d Richey said.",

            "date": "2024-03-28 12:08:00",
            "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried , the former CEO of FTX, was a 30-year-old crypto wunderkind who for years garnered goodwill as a philanthropist and leading proponent of industry regulation. Now, his ex-firm is bankrupt and he has been convicted of defrauding investors out of billions of dollars. On Thursday, a federal judge sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison. Some crypto traders, who deposited their savings on the platform, may never get their money back. MORE: What FTX's bankruptcy filing means for the future of digital currency Below is a timeline of the series of events that explains exactly how the company and its founder fell so far and so fast. 2024 Jan. 31 \u2013 A lawyer representing the bankruptcy estate of FTX said the firm expects to fully repay customers. \"There is still a great amount of work and risk between us and that result, but we believe the objective is within reach, and we have a strategy to achieve it,\" FTX attorney Andrew Dietderich said at a court hearing. Feb. 27 \u2013 Attorneys for Bankman-Fried filed a memo saying he should receive a prison sentence of between 5.25 and 6.5 years. March 15 \u2013 Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried should receive 40 to 50 years in prison due to the \"enormous scale of the fraud.\" March 28 \u2013 A federal judge sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison. \"This was a very serious crime,\" U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said. 2023 Jan. 3 \u2013 In a New York courtroom, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that he defrauded investors. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan announced that the trial would take place in October. Jan. 12 \u2013 Bankman-Fried published a 2,300-word blog post rebuking the fraud and conspiracy charges, replete with charts and graphs. He said that he didn't steal customer funds, instead blaming the company's woes on a sharp downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Aug. 11 \u2013 Bankman-Fried had his bail revoked and was immediately remanded to custody of the U.S. Marshals. Bankman-Fried had tampered with witnesses, prosecutors alleged, citing his decision to share Caroline Ellison\u2019s personal writings with the New York Times. Thereafter, Bankman-Fried was housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn while he awaited trial. Oct. 3 \u2013 Proceedings began in Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial. Over the ensuing weeks, Ellison would become one of the prosecution\u2019s star witnesses, saying Bankman-Fried did not think rules applied to him. Bankman-Fried testified in his own defense across three days of hearings. Nov. 2 \u2013 A jury found Bankman-Fried guilty on all charges in his federal fraud and conspiracy trial. In all, the charges carry a maximum sentence of 110 years in prison. 2022 Nov. 2 \u2013 The collapse of FTX centers in part on the cryptocurrency exchange's close relationship with Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund also founded by Bankman-Fried. Major concerns about FTX started when news outlet CoinDesk published an article that found a significant portion of Alameda Research's assets consisted of FTT, a token created by FTX that allows users of the exchange to access discounted trading fees. Because FTT cannot be easily exchanged for cash, the report stoked fears about the capital reserves at Alameda Research and thus FTX. MORE: Billionaire donors are defecting from Trump. Here's who to watch. Nov. 6 \u2013 In response to the article, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of rival crypto exchange Binance, often referred to as \"CZ,\" said he would sell all of the company's holdings in FTT, which amount to $580 million worth of the token. The major exit from a crypto heavyweight triggered a wider selloff, akin to a bank run, placing immense pressure on FTX to meet the sudden demand for customer withdrawals. Due to a lack of funds, FTX halted customer withdrawals altogether. Nov. 8 \u2013 FTX reached a deal to sell itself to Binance, the crypto exchange whose executive had helped trigger the selloff. \"This is a user-centric development that benefits the entire industry,\" Bankman-Fried said . \"CZ has done, and will continue to do, an incredible job of building out the global crypto ecosystem, and creating a freer economic world.\" \"The important thing is that customers are protected,\" he added . Nov. 9 \u2013 Binance withdrew from the deal to acquire FTX. \"As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of FTX.com.,\" Binance said . MORE: These tech companies have imposed major layoffs in 2022 Zhao, of Binance, summed up the decision in a tweet: Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department had begun investigating the FTX collapse, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Nov. 12 \u2013 The Wall Street Journal reported that FTX lent customer deposits to Alameda Research to help it meet its liabilities, and top executives at Alameda Research were aware of it, raising further scrutiny about the relationship between Alameda Research and FTX. Nov. 14 \u2013 The collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX became the subject of an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. At issue, the sources said, is whether FTX violated securities laws when it reportedly gave customer funds to Alameda Research. Nov. 16 \u2013 House lawmakers called on Bankman-Fried as well as executives at Alameda and Binance to testify in a hearing on Capitol Hill in December. \"The fall of FTX has posed tremendous harm to over one million users, many of whom were everyday people who invested their hard-earned savings into the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, only to watch it all disappear within a matter of seconds,\" Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, this event is just one out of many examples of cryptocurrency platforms that have collapsed just this past year.\" Meanwhile, celebrity boosters of FTX -- including Naomi Osaka, Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin O'Leary -- were sued in federal court in a class-action lawsuit alleging that false representations of a deceptive product were used to dupe vulnerable investors. \"I had no knowledge, nor did any of the other celebrities, of what occurred here,\" O'Leary, an entrepreneur and panelist on the TV show \"Shark Tank,\" told ABC's \"Nightline.\" Later in the day, Vox published an interview in which Bankman-Fried disparages regulators using an expletive, confesses that his previous calls for tighter crypto regulation had been driven by public relations concerns and says he regrets the company declaring bankruptcy.

Dec. 12 \u2013 Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas after federal prosecutors in New York filed criminal charges contained in a sealed indictment, according to the Royal Bahamas Police Force. A source familiar with the charges told ABC News that Bankman-Fried is facing a multi-count fraud indictment one month after FTX filed a $32 billion bankruptcy. The arrest \"followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against SBF and is likely to request his extradition,\" the Bahamas Attorney General's Office said. Dec. 13 \u2013 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors. \"FTX's collapse highlights the very real risks that unregistered crypto asset trading platforms can pose for investors and customers alike,\" said Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, in a statement. ABC News' Aaron Katersky, Meredith Deliso, Mark Osborne, Mark Gaurino and Melissa Gaffney contributed to this report.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 15:14:00",
            "content": "GALLATIN, Tenn. -- Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee said Monday that he thinks workers at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga made a mistake by voting to unionize under the United Auto Workers in a landslide election but acknowledged the choice was ultimately up to them. Ahead of the vote, Lee and five other Southern Republican governors spoke out publicly against the UAW's drive to organize workers at factories largely in the South, arguing that if autoworkers were to vote for union representation, it would jeopardize jobs. Instead, the union wound up pulling 73% of the vote at a facility whose workers had narrowly rejected the union in 2019 and 2014. The Volkswagen plant vote was the first to follow a series of strikes last fall against Detroit\u2019s automakers that resulted in lucrative new contracts. Workers at Mercedes factories near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, will vote on UAW representation in May. Lee told reporters Monday that the Volkswagen vote was \u201ca loss for workers.\" He noted that he has a \u201clong history with skilled workers\" \u2014 workers are not unionized at his family's business, Lee Company, which employs about 1,600 people in home, facilities and construction projects. \u201cI think it's unwise to put your future in somebody else's hands,\u201d Lee said at an event in Gallatin. \u201cBut those workers made that decision based on the individual circumstances of that plant. I think it was a mistake, but that's their choice.\u201d The Volkswagen win was the union's first in a Southern assembly plant owned by a foreign automaker. President Joe Biden condemned the push by Lee and other Southern Republican governors to urge auto workers to vote against the union. The Democrat praised the success of unions representing autoworkers, Hollywood actors and writers, health care workers and others in gaining better contracts. \u201cLet me be clear to the Republican governors that tried to undermine this vote: there is nothing to fear from American workers using their voice and their legal right to form a union if they so choose,\u201d Biden said in a news release Friday.",

It started having problems about six months after I got it, even though it was new. I have taken it in seven times for repairs. It costs me time and gas money to go drop off the car each time. Still, the problem has persisted. Eventually I took matters into my own hands and called the manufacturer and began a \u201cLemon Law\u201d case. They keep telling me they are investigating. At one point, they offered me $2,500 to close the case and keep the car, but I decided to continue with the lemon process. However, I am still waiting for a resolution. I am frustrated. I believe it is time to get some help from you. Thanks. -Sahib Bhatia, Fresno, Calif. Do you have a consumer problem? The ABC News Fixer may be able to help. Click here to submit your problem online . Letters are edited for length and clarity. Dear Sahib: First, one thing you left out of your letter: You\u2019re a high school student! You were dealing with trying to fix the car (seven times!), plus researching your state\u2019s Lemon Law and staying on top of your case \u2013 all while keeping up with homework, applying for college and playing on your school\u2019s tennis team. That\u2019s a lot to handle. You had done so much work and were so organized, the ABC News Fixer was more than happy to give this a little push over the finish line. You told us the first sign of trouble came one day as you drove on the highway about six months after getting the car. As you approached your exit, the shifter lost power and the \u201ccheck engine\u201d light came on. The car stalled, but luckily you were already at the ramp, so you coasted down and rolled to a stop. The car was stuck in neutral and you couldn\u2019t turn it off because the shifter wouldn\u2019t shift into park. After some stressful attempts, you finally got the car into park and turned it off. Later, when the dealership looked at it, they couldn\u2019t find the cause. You kept driving \u2013 and it happened again. And again. When you hit a pothole\u2026when you stopped in a fast-food drive-thru. You took it in seven times at two different dealerships, but the problem kept happening.Luckily, you kept good records. And you looked into the California Lemon Law, which protects consumers who have persistent problems with new vehicles. Your dad filed the case with the manufacturer \u2013 his name was on the sales contract \u2013 but you took charge of the phone calls. That became your new hobby, calling the manufacturer to try to get an update on your case. You told The Fixer you think many consumers would have gotten tired and given up after six months of repair attempts at two different dealerships and another two months of dealing with the manufacturer. But you kept at it. We reviewed your documents and got in touch with Fiat Chrysler , which owns the Dodge brand, asking about the delay. Shortly after, you got some good news \u2013 they were offering your choice of a replacement vehicle or the monetary value of your car. You opted for the money. We asked Fiat Chrysler about the long wait, and a company spokesman said that\u2019s just the way it is \u2014 it\u2019s a complex process, with the title needing to clear from owner to manufacturer. The company said that in the end, they were glad they could take care of this \u201cin the interest of customer satisfaction.\u201d You were smart to stay organized and keep good records of all the problems you had with the car. Lemon laws vary from state to state, but are generally for new cars that have persistent, substantial issues. In your home state of California, a car is a lemon if, within 18 months or 18,000 miles, there have been two or more attempts to repair a serious problem that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury, or four or more attempts to repair the same issue, or if the car has been in the shop for more than 30 days. Here are some more tips for success in a Lemon Law case:\u2022 Act quickly. Check the deadline to file in your state. You don\u2019t want to lose out because you waited too long to file. And be sure to contact the manufacturer, not the dealer, to file your lemon case.\u2022 Keep excellent records. Write down the purpose and date of each repair and note how long your car was in the shop each time.\u2022 If you win, you will get a replacement vehicle, or the cash value minus the mileage. \u2022 Don\u2019t expect to get reimbursement for after-market items. If you lose your case, you can still go to court. Note: Lemon laws don\u2019t apply to used cars. That\u2019s why used car buyers need to be especially careful. Here are some great tips on buying a used car . And if you\u2019re wondering where lemons end up, they can be repaired and resold, but their registration must disclose that they were once a \u201clemon buy-back\u201d vehicle. -The ABC News Fixer Do you have a consumer problem?

            "date": "2024-04-24 14:40:00",
            "content": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- One of the two pilots of a vintage military plane that was delivering heating oil to a remote Alaska Native village reported a fire on board shortly before the aircraft crashed and burned outside Fairbanks, killing both of them and leaving debris over a wide area, a federal transportation official said Wednesday. The pilot made radio contact about the in-flight emergency shortly after taking off Tuesday, said Clint Johnson, head of the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s Alaska regional office. They were attempting to return to Fairbanks International Airport when they lost contact, he said. The C54D-DC airplane \u2014 a military version of the World War II-era Douglas DC-4 aircraft \u2014 crashed about 7 miles (11 kilometers) outside Fairbanks. It hit a steep hill, slid down an embankment to the bank of the Tanana River and burst into flames. No survivors were found, according to Alaska State Troopers. Troopers said recovery efforts would resume Wednesday with the aid of cadaver dogs, but they noted that thin ice and open water on the river were making their efforts difficult. The pilots\u2019 names have not been released. The partial remains that have been recovered will be sent to the State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office in Anchorage for identification, troopers said. The roughly 80-year-old plane departed Fairbanks just before 10 a.m., loaded with 3,200 gallons (12,100 liters) of heating oil destined for Kobuk, an Inupiat village of less than 200 people located about 300 miles (480 kilometers) northwest of Fairbanks. Mike Emers was working in his office at Rosie Creek Farm, the only outdoor cannabis farm in Alaska, when he heard an explosion, looked out the window and saw the plane on fire. \u201cI knew it was going down. I just didn\u2019t know where,\u201d he said. Video from farm security cameras showed the aircraft flying until one of its four engines \u2014 the one closest to the fuselage \u2014 exploded. The plane then banked and plummeted. Emers tried to call 911 but couldn\u2019t get through, so he instead reported it to the troopers\u2019 dispatch line. He, his son and a neighbor went to the crash site, where they peered around the corner of an ice shelf and saw huge flames. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t recognize that it was a plane,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was debris everywhere, and all the trees were torched, and there was fire everywhere.\u201d Upslope they came across more debris that he described as a mix of airplane parts, clothing and personal items. The fire was still burning above the plane, and Emers used his sweatshirt to beat at the flames to prevent them from spreading to more trees, fearing a forest fire could devastate the neighborhood. First responders arrived about 15 minutes later. Another witness, Gary Contento, was sitting on his deck overlooking the river when he heard a loud explosion, followed by a second one. Looking for what caused the blasts, he saw a burning object on river ice. \u201cI assumed right off the bat that it was an engine, because it was flaming away,\u201d he said. He watched for a minute or two as a smoke plume rose into the air, and \u201cthen a fireball to beat all fireballs went off.\u201d Johnson said that in addition to the heating oil, there were about 1,200 gallons of aviation fuel aboard the C54D-DC Skymaster plane. It is difficult and expensive to get fuel to rural Alaska villages, which are remote and hard to reach because of the state\u2019s limited road system. The Northwest Arctic Borough said heating fuel in Kobuk cost $15.45 a gallon in 2022. The Alaska Energy Authority said barges usually deliver fuel to coastal communities. But in places where barges can\u2019t run or it\u2019s not economically feasible, air tankers will deliver fuel. And even that can be limited by sea or river ice, water levels or ice road availability. The C54D-DC is a military version of the Douglas DC-4, a World War II-era aircraft. The planes aided the Berlin Airlift of 1948, when the U.S. and Britain flew food and fuel to Allied-controlled parts of the city after it was cut off by a Soviet blockade. The plane that crashed Tuesday was built in Chicago around 1942 and saw service with the U.S. Army Air Force, the U.S. Navy and the Royal Air Force, before a California company took ownership in 1974, according to the Aerial Visuals Airframe Dossier website. It later was owned by companies in Arizona and Fairbanks, with Alaska Air Fuel taking it over in 2013. The plane was rebuilt between 2018 and 2020, Alaska Air Fuel, which is based in Wasilla, has not responded to phone messages seeking comment. The NTSB sent three investigators to the crash scene.",

The increase will take effect on July 1, the first time since 2000 that pensions in Europe's biggest economy have risen by more than the annual inflation rate, which in March stood at 2.2%, German news agency dpa reported. An increase last year of 4.39% in the former West Germany and 5.86% in the less prosperous and formerly communist east completed efforts to bring pensions in the two parts of the once-divided country level more than 30 years after reunification.

            "content": "LONDON -- British competition regulators said Wednesday they'll scrutinize recent artificial intelligence deals by Microsoft and Amazon over concerns that the moves could thwart competition in the AI industry. The Competition and Markets Authority said it's looking into Microsoft's partnership with France's Mistral AI and the company's hiring of key staff from another startup, Inflection AI. The watchdog also separately announced that it's investigating Amazon's $4 billion investment in San Francisco-based Anthropic. Big Tech companies have been pouring money into generative AI startups amid growing public and business interest in the technology, but the investments have also drawn attention from antitrust authorities. The U.K. watchdog said it was seeking comments from \u201cinterested third parties,\" before deciding whether to carry out an in-depth antitrust investigation. \"We will assess, objectively and impartially, whether each of these three deals fall within U.K. merger rules and, if they do, whether they have any impact on competition in the U.K.,\" the watchdog\u2019s executive director of mergers, Joel Bamford, said in a statement. Microsoft said it will provide the watchdog with the information it needs to carry out its inquiries. \u201cWe remain confident that common business practices such as the hiring of talent or making a\u202ffractional\u202finvestment in an AI\u202fstart-up\u202fpromote\u202fcompetition and are\u202fnot the same as\u202fa merger, the company said. Microsoft last month hired Mustafa Suleyman, who co-founded Google\u2019s DeepMind AI research lab, to head up its consumer artificial intelligence business, along with the chief scientist and several top engineers and researchers from Inflection, his AI startup. Microsoft also teamed up earlier this year with Mistral, which has become France's AI darling after being founded only last year. That followed Microsoft's previous existing partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is also facing scrutiny from the CMA. Mistral said it's \u201cfully committed to cooperating with the CMA throughout this process to ensure that our long-term independence and access to the market are upheld.\u201d Amazon, meanwhile, has spent billions for a minority stake in Anthropic. The two companies are collaborating to develop so-called foundation models, which underpin the generative AI systems that have captured global attention. \u201cIt's unprecedented for the CMA to review a collaboration of this type,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cUnlike partnerships between other AI startups and large technology companies, our collaboration with Anthropic includes a limited investment, doesn\u2019t give Amazon a board director or observer role, and continues to have Anthropic running its models on multiple cloud providers.\u201d The CMA said it's stepping up its scrutiny of the market for foundation models after it published a report that highlighted the risk that powerful companies could use partnerships with key AI players to strengthen their positions.",

            "date": "2024-04-24 08:42:00",
            "content": "TOKYO -- A team of experts from the U.N. nuclear agency inspected the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant Wednesday for a review of its discharge of treated radioactive wastewater into the Pacific. The International Atomic Energy Agency inspection was part of a four-day visit to Japan that started Tuesday, its second since the water discharge began last August despite strong protests from fishing groups and neighboring China , which has banned Japanese seafood. The IAEA team will issue a report later. The Japanese government and the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, say the discharges are diluted to better than international standards, and IAEA chief Rafael Mariano Grossi said in March that they were being carried out safely. During the site visit Wednesday, the plant suffered a temporary blackout when some underground digging apparently damaged an electrical cable in an area separate from the water discharge. The blackout halted the water discharges for several hours, but the IAEA was nonetheless able to complete its inspection, according to TEPCO. One excavation worker suffered burns and had to be treated in hospital, but the plant's cooling systems were unaffected and the water discharge resumed safely Wednesday evening, TEPCO said. The IAEA did not immediately comment on the blackout. A 2011 earthquake and tsunami damaged the Fukushima plant\u2019s power supply and reactor cooling functions, triggering meltdowns of three reactors and causing large amounts of radioactive wastewater to accumulate. After more than a decade of cleanup work, the plant began discharging the water after treating it and diluting it with seawater on Aug. 24, starting a process that\u2019s expected to take decades. After Wednesday\u2019s plant visit, the IAEA team members are expected to have more discussion in Tokyo through Friday. Data and samples collected from the Fukushima plant will be corroborated at IAEA labs and independent third-party labs from China, South Korea, Switzerland and the United States, and will be released in a report later. \u201cThis independent, objective and science-based approach will help build confidence to the people in Japan and beyond,\u201d mission leader Gustavo Caruso, director of safety and security coordination at IAEA, said at a meeting Tuesday with Japanese officials. The team includes independent international experts from 10 countries \u2013 Argentina, Australia, Britain, Canada, China, France, Russia, South Korea, the United States and Vietnam. Japan\u2019s government and TEPCO note that the treated water is filtered and diluted by large amounts of seawater. Results of monitoring of seawater and marine life samples near the plant show concentrations of tritium, the only inseparable radioactive material, are far below recommended limits, they say. Fishing groups worry about a negative reputation from the release, and neighboring China has not been convinced of the safety. China banned all imports of Japanese seafood immediately after the release began. The plant has released about 31,200 tons of the treated water in four batches. The ongoing fifth batch of 7,800-ton release lasts through May 7. Wednesday\u2019s cable damage and blackout was a latest in a series of incidents at the plant in recent months. In October, two workers were hospitalized after being splashed with radioactive liquid while cleaning a water treatment system, though they had no health problems from the exposure. In February, some contaminated water leaked at another facility on the plant due to human error.",

            "date": "2024-04-23 15:06:00",
            "content": "MEXICO CITY -- The head of Mexico \u2019s detective service acknowledged Tuesday that the country is \u201cthe champion\u201d of fentanyl production, something that appears to run counter to past statements by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. L\u00f3pez Obrador has hotly denied in the past that any fentanyl is produced in Mexico, saying Mexican cartels only press it into pills or add finishing touches. But Felipe de Jesus Gallo, the head of Mexico\u2019s Criminal Investigation Agency, said that since the 1990s \u201cMexico has been the champion of methamphetamine production, and now fentanyl.\u201d He spoke at a U.S.-Mexico conference on synthetic drugs in Mexico City. Experts agree that cartels in Mexico use precursor chemicals from China and India to make the synthetic opioid and smuggle it into the United States, where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually. While fentanyl is not widely abused in Mexico, methamphetamine addiction is commonplace. Gallo said that Mexican cartels have launched industrial-scale production of meth in many states throughout the country and now export the drug around the world. \u201cBelieve me, methamphetamine production has become industrialized, it's not just in the mountains anymore,\u201d Gallo said. \u201cWe now expect to see (drug) laboratories not just in the mountains of Sinaloa and Sonora, but in Hidalgo as well, Puebla, and also in Jalisco.\" He was apparently referring to thousands of drug labs detected in previous years in the hills and scrublands around Culiacan, the capital of the northern state of Sinaloa. Those clandestine, rural production sites were often bare-bones, improvised labs covered with tree branches and tarpaulins. Now, the meth trade has become so lucrative and so sophisticated that Mexican meth is exported as far away as Hong Kong or Australia , and the cartels have found ways to avoid detection of their drug money. \u201cThe business models have become very innovative, or as old and antiquated as barter; \u2018I\u2019ll trade you precursor chemicals for meth,' to avoid leaving a money trail,\u201d Gallo said. There is little question that drug production goes on at a huge scale in Mexico. In February, Mexico's Navy seized over 45 tons of methamphetamine at the biggest drug lab found during the current administration. The lab was in Quiriego, a township in a remote part of the northern border state of Sonora. The 91,000 pounds (41,310 kilograms) of meth found there was more than half of the 162,000 pounds of the drug Mexico has seized so far this year. Fentanyl production is also huge, though because it is a more potent drug, the volume is smaller. A year ago, soldiers seized more than a half-million fentanyl pills in Culiacan in what the army at the time described as the largest synthetic drug lab found to date. Soldiers found almost 630,000 pills that appeared to contain fentanyl, the army said. They also reported seizing 282 pounds (128 kilograms) of powdered fentanyl and about 220 pounds (100 kilograms) of suspected methamphetamine. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1 2018, also claims that Mexicans are culturally immune to drug addiction.",

            "date": "2024-04-24 12:26:00",
            "content": "ROME -- Italy\u2019s Culture Ministry has banned loans of works to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, following a dispute with the U.S. museum over an ancient marble statue believed to have been looted from Italy almost a half-century ago. The dispute began in March 2022 when an Italian court ruled that the Minneapolis museum was irregularly in possession of the Stabiae Doriforo, a Roman-era copy of The Doryphoros of Polykleitos, an ancient Greek sculpture. Rome claims that the sculpture was looted in the 1970s from an archaeological site at Stabiae, an ancient city close to Pompeii that was also covered by lava and ashes when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. A spokesman for Italy\u2019s Culture Ministry confirmed the ban on Wednesday. In February 2022, Italian prosecutors issued an international warrant for the artwork to be impounded and returned. At a news conference earlier this year, Nunzio Fragliasso, chief prosecutor at the Torre Annunziata court, said they were \u201cstill awaiting a response.\u201d In 1984, while the work was on display in a German museum, Italy initiated a legal proceeding to claim it. The claim was denied in 1986. The U.S. museum, which bought the statue in 1986 for $2.5 million, said it was purchased from art dealer Elie Borowski and imported into the United States. \u201cSince that time, the work has been publicly displayed and extensively published,\u201d the Minneapolis museum said in a statement. \u201cWhile it takes issue with recent press reports regarding the Doryphoros, Mia (the museum) believes that the media is not an appropriate forum to address unproven allegations.\u201d The museum asserted that it has always acted \u201cresponsibly and proactively\" with respect to claims related to its collection. However, it added, \u201dwhere proof has not been provided, as well as where Mia has evidence reasonably demonstrating that a claim is not supported, Mia has declined to transfer the work.\" The museum called Italy\u2019s new ban on loans \u201ccontrary to decades of exchanges between museums.\u201d",

            "date": "2024-04-24 05:44:00",
            "content": "BEIJING -- As auto giant Volkswagen AG races to catch up with upstart Chinese competitors, it has drivers like 26-year-old Ren Yiling in mind. She is young and wants to play video games in her car. The digital features of her Zeekr 001, a European-designed electric car from China 's Geely Holding Group, appeal to her. She uses her smartphone to help her parents adjust their seats and tells an animated voice assistant to open the window or play music. \u201cI once sung karaoke in the car when travelling a long way with my family,\u201d she said. \"To me, the car is more like an entertainment place. I am a singer.\u201d Foreign automakers have been caught flat-footed in China by an electric vehicle boom that has shaken up the market, the world's largest, over the last three years. Taking a page from Tesla, China's automakers and hundreds of start-ups have developed EVs loaded with tablet-like screens, AI-enabled information and entertainment options and autonomous driving capabilities. EV sales in China, encouraged by green energy subsidies and tax breaks, jumped from 900,000 units in 2020 to 5.1 million last year, accounting for 24% of new car sales, according to the China Passenger Car Association, an industry group. The boom caters to a new breed of car buyers who equate an EV with digital connectivity and are demanding smartphone features in their vehicles. That has left makers like Volkswagen, which sells about one-third of its cars in China, scrambling to develop new models for a very different market than back home, and expanding far beyond its roots in China as a maker of no-frills sedans used by taxi fleets. The Volkswagen Group, which also includes Audi and Porsche, plans to launch 40 new models in China over the next three years and to have a lineup of 30 EVs by 2030 in what Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume told investors Wednesday is the company\u2019s \u201csecond home market.\u201d Japanese maker Nissan has also stepped up, saying it would develop four new-energy models, which can include hybrids, for the Chinese market by 2026. Ralf Brandst\u00e4tter, VW's CEO in China, said drivers use their cars differently in China, where the average age of an EV buyer is 35 years old, versus 55 in Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s not only to go from A to B, they live in their car as additional living space. They spend time there with friends. They spend time there with families,\u201d he told journalists ahead of the opening of the Beijing Auto Show on Thursday. \u201cAnd they are ... highly tech-savvy. (They are) using their mobiles five hours per day and they want to have the same digital connectivity with their cars. So we will deliver these Chinese \u2018wow\u2019 effects that Chinese customers expect.\u201d The battle is not only about digital gadgetry. Chinese EV makers have driven down battery and production costs and flooded the market with choices, depressing prices to levels that are likely unsustainable. China's largest EV maker, BYD, has dropped the price of its Seagull model below $10,000 at home, about half of what it sells for in Mexico and Brazil. \u201cThe Chinese market remains very difficult, especially when it comes to electric vehicles\u201d Brandst\u00e4tter said, noting that EV prices in China had fallen 30% in the past year even before a new round of price cuts started this month. Volkswagen's response has been to shift to developing cars in China from the ground up, rather than adapting European models to the local market. The company announced earlier this month that it would invest 2.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion) to expand research and development and production in the city of Hefei, where it has teamed up with Chinese EV maker XPENG Motors to develop two midsize VW models to launch in 2026. The company is developing a new EV platform, which includes the chassis and battery packs, just for China to try to bring down costs by 40%. That would enable VW to be profitable at current market prices, Brandst\u00e4tter said, calling China an essential market for Volkswagen. \u201cI think they are really putting their foot down and saying we need to do more, we need to speed up,\" said Beatrix Keim, the China director at CAR, an automotive research center in Germany. Volkswagen still has a ways to go. It sold only 41,000 EVs in China in the first three months of the year, though that was up 91% over the previous year and followed the rollout of new or updated models. \u201cI think they really learned already their lesson \u2013 that they need to be faster,\u201d Keim said. The company has come under fire for operating a plant in the China's western Xinjiang region, where Western governments have accused the Chinese government of human rights violations. Volkswagen has said an audit it commissioned found no evidence of forced labor at the facility, though Brandst\u00e4tter said Wednesday that VW is in talks with its Chinese joint venture partner in Xinjiang and is investigating options for the plant's future. The company showed off its digital development efforts to journalists at an R & D facility in Beijing earlier this week. Drivers can pick avatars for an on-screen assistant that responds to voice requests for directions or to adjust the inside temperature. A 3-D avatar to be launched this year has changeable outfits and can rock with the music. Such features are also being added to VW's gasoline-powered vehicles, said Matthias Glodny, the vice president for products in China. \u201cWe think we have a plan,\" he said, \u201cand now we have to deliver.\u201d ___ Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed.",

            "date": "2024-04-24 08:02:00",
            "content": "JERUSALEM -- A ship near the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait saw an explosion in the distance Wednesday, marking what may be a new attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels through the crucial waterway for international trade. The explosion, reported by the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, comes after a relative lull from the Houthis after they launched dozens of attacks on shipping in the region over Israel's ongoing war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for the blast, but suspicion fell on the group as they've repeatedly targeted ships in the same area. It typically takes the Houthis several hours before acknowledging their assaults. The explosion happened some 130 kilometers (80 miles) southeast of Djibouti in the Gulf of Aden. \u201cThe master of a merchant vessel reports an explosion in the water a distance form the vessel,\u201d the UKMTO said. \u201cVeseel and crew reported safe. Authorities are investigating.\" The private maritime security firm Ambrey separately reported the apparent attack. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sank another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. Houthi attacks have dropped in recent weeks as the rebels have been targeted by a U.S.-led airstrike campaign in Yemen and shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat. American officials have speculated that the rebels may be running out of weapons as a result of the U.S.-led campaign against them and firing off drones and missiles steadily in the last months. The Houthis have said they would continue their attacks until Israel ends its war in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage. The ships targeted by the Houthis largely have had little or no direct connection to Israel, the U.S. or other nations involved in the war. The rebels have also fired missiles toward Israel, though they have largely fallen short or been intercepted. The assaults on shipping have raised the profile of the Houthis, who are members of Islam\u2019s minority Shiite Zaydi sect, which ruled Yemen for 1,000 years until 1962. The group seized Sanaa, Yemen's capital, in late 2014. A Saudi-led coalition has been battling the group in a stalemated conflict since 2015.",

            "title": "Poland's prosecutor general says previous government used spyware against hundreds of people",
            "date": "2024-04-24 11:27:00",
            "content": "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland's prosecutor general told the parliament on Wednesday that powerful Pegasus spyware was used against hundreds of people during the former government in Poland, among them elected officials. Adam Bodnar told lawmakers that he found the scale of the surveillance \u201cshocking and depressing.\u201d \u201cIt is sad for me that even in this room I am speaking to people who were victims of this system,\u201d Bodnar told the Sejm, the lower house of parliament. Bodnar, who is also the justice minister, didn't specify who exactly was subject to surveillance by the spyware. His office said the information was confidential. Bodnar was presenting information that the prosecutor general's office sent last week to the Sejm and Senate. The data showed that Pegasus was used in the cases of 578 people from 2017 to 2022, and that it was used by three separate government agencies: the Central Anticorruption Bureau, the Military Counterintelligence Service and the Internal Security Agency. The data show that it was used against six people in 2017; 100 in 2018; 140 in 2019; 161 in 2020; 162 in 2021; and then nine in 2022, when it stopped. The Associated Press broke the news of the former governments' abuse of Pegasus in December 2021, based on forensics by the University of Toronto's online watchdog Citizen Lab. Bodnar said that the software generated \u201cenormous knowledge\u201d about the \u201cprivate and professional lives\u201d of those put under surveillance. He also stressed that the Polish state doesn't have full control over the data that is gathered because the system operates on the basis of a license that was granted by an Israeli company. He said \u201dthe use of this type of method must raise serious doubts from the point of view of the protection of constitutional rights.\" Pegasus, produced by Israel's the NSO Group, has been sold to governments and is described as a tool to fight criminals and terrorists. However, evidence has emerged of governments using it against political opponents, journalists and human rights workers. The Biden administration, concerned about the potential of the technology for abuse, blacklisted the NSO Group in 2021, barring it from access to U.S. technology. This year it went further and imposed visa restrictions on foreign individuals involved in the misuse of commercial spyware. Pegasus gives its operators complete access to a mobile device, allowing them to extract passwords, photos, messages, contacts and browsing history and activate the microphone and camera for real-time eavesdropping. Its use in Poland under the previous government, led by the Law and Justice party, resulted in accusations that the authorities were abusing power and eroding democratic guardrails. Investigations into the use of the powerful spyware were launched after Prime Minister Donald Tusk took office in December as the head of a three-party pro-European Union coalition. The investigations into Pegasus use are part of a larger effort by Tusk and Bodnar to restore democratic norms that they believe were eroded by the Law and Justice government, which held power from 2015 to 2023. \u201cThe use of Pegasus over these few years has poisoned the essence of democracy in Poland,\u201d Marcin Bosacki, a lawmaker with Tusk\u2019s centrist Civic Coalition, told lawmakers after Bodnar's presentation. Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the head of Law and Justice, said last month during testimony to an investigative commission that the \u201cuse of Pegasus was in accordance with the law,\u201d and that in 99% of the cases it was used against criminals. The minister currently in charge of the security services, Tomasz Siemoniak, said earlier this month in an interview on the private broadcaster TVN24 that while the use of Pegasus in Poland was \u201cjustified\u201d in some cases of suspected terrorism and for counterintelligence use, in \u201ctoo many cases\u201d it wasn't justified. Siemoniak said the unjustified use of the software resulted in Poland losing its license for using it. Bodnar is also working to address the issue of judicial independence after the previous government overhauled the justice system to gain more control over courts. The practices of Law and Justice prompted the European Union to withhold billions of euros in funding \u2014 money that is now flowing after a change of government.",

            "title": "TikTok may be banned in the US. Here's what happened when India did it",
            "date": "2024-04-24 05:52:00",
            "content": "NEW DELHI -- The hugely popular Chinese app TikTok may be forced out of the U.S., where a measure to outlaw the video-sharing app has won congressional approval and is on its way to President Biden for his signature. In India, the app was banned nearly four years ago. Here's what happened: In June 2020, TikTok users in India bid goodbye to the app, which is operated by Chinese internet firm ByteDance. New Delhi had suddenly banned the popular app, alongside dozens other Chinese apps, following a military clash along the India-China border. Twenty Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed, and ties between the two Asian giants plunged to a new low. The government cited privacy concerns and said that Chinese apps pose a threat to India\u2019s sovereignty and security. The move mostly drew widespread support in India, where protesters had been calling for a boycott of Chinese goods since the deadly confrontation in the remote Karakoram mountain border region. \u201cThere was a clamour leading up to this, and the popular narrative was how can we allow Chinese companies to do business in India when we\u2019re in the middle of a military standoff,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy expert and founder of tech website MediaNama. Just months before the ban, India had also restricted investment from Chinese companies, Pahwa added. \u201cTikTok wasn\u2019t a one-off case. Today, India has banned over 500 Chinese apps to date.\u201d At the time, India had about 200 million TikTok users. And the company also employed thousands of Indians. TikTok users and content creators, however, needed a place to go \u2014 and the ban provided a multi-billion dollar opportunity to snatch up a big market. Within months, Google rolled out YouTube Shorts and Instagram pushed out its Reels feature. Both mimicked the short-form video creation that TikTok had excelled at. \u201cAnd they ended up capturing most of the market that TikTok had vacated,\u201d said Pahwa. In India, TikTok content was hyperlocal, which made it quite unique. It opened a window into the lives of small-town India, with videos coming from tier 2 and 3 cities that showed people doing tricks while laying down bricks, for example. But for the most part, content creators and users in the four years since the ban have moved on to other platforms. Winnie Sangma misses posting videos on TikTok and earning a bit of money. But after the ban, he migrated to Instagram and now has 15,000 followers. The process, for the most part, has been relatively painless. \u201cI have built up followers on Instagram too, and I am making money from it, but the experience isn\u2019t like how it used to be on TikTok,\u201d he said. Rajib Dutta, a frequent scroller on TikTok, also switched to Instagram after the ban. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a big deal,\u201d he said. The legislation to outlaw the app has won congressional approval and now awaits a signature from Biden. The measure gives ByteDance, the app\u2019s parent company, nine months to sell it, and three more if a sale is underway. If this doesn\u2019t happen, TikTok will be banned. It would take at least a year before a ban goes into effect, but with likely court challenges, it could stretch longer. In India, the ban in 2020 was swift. TikTok and other companies were given time to respond to questions on privacy and security, and by January 2021, it became a permanent ban. But the situation in the U.S. is different, said Pahwa. \u201cIn India, TikTok decided not to go to court, but the U.S. is a bigger revenue market for them. Also, the First Amendment in America is fairly strong, so it\u2019s not going to be as easy for the U.S. to do this as it was for India,\u201d he said, in reference to free speech rights in the U.S. Constitution. As Chinese apps proliferate across the world, Pahwa says countries need to assess their dependency on China and develop a way to reduce it as the apps can pose a national security risk. The app is also banned in Pakistan, Nepal and Afghanistan and restricted in many countries in Europe. \u201cChinese intelligence law and its cybersecurity law can allow Chinese apps to work in the interest of their own security. That creates a situation of distrust and it becomes a national security risk for others,\u201d said Pahwa. \u201cThere should be different rules for democratic countries and for authoritarian regimes where companies can act as an extension of the state,\u201d he added. \u2014- This story corrects the expert's erroneous reference to Fourth instead of First Amendment.",

            "date": "2024-04-22 18:05:00",
            "content": "LIMA, Peru -- A Peruvian psychologist who had an incurable disease that weakened her muscles and left her bedridden for several years died by euthanasia, her lawyer said Monday, becoming the first person in the country to obtain the right to die with medical assistance. Ana Estrada fought for years in Peruvian courts for the right to choose to die, and became a celebrity in the conservative country where euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal. In 2022, Estrada was granted an exception by the nation\u2019s Supreme Court, which upheld a ruling by a lower court that gave Estrada the right to decide when to end her life, and said that those who helped her would not be punished. Estrada became the first person to obtain the right to die with medical assistance in Peru. \u201cAna\u2019s struggle for her right to die with dignity has helped to educate thousands of Peruvians about this right and the importance of defending it,\u201d her lawyer, Josefina Mir\u00f3 Quesada, said in a statement. \u201cHer struggle transcended our nation\u2019s borders.\u201d Estrada, 47, had an incurable disease called polymyositis that wastes away muscles. She began to present the first symptoms as a teenager and started to use a wheelchair at the age of 20 because she had lost the strength to walk. Estrada obtained a psychology degree and became a therapist. She earned enough money to buy her own apartment and became independent from her parents. By 2017, however, Estrada\u2019s condition worsened and she could no longer get up from her bed. She had difficulty breathing and survived pneumonia. And even though she could not type, Estrada used transcription software to produce a blog called \u201cAna for a death with dignity,\u201d where she discussed her struggles and her decision to seek euthanasia. \u201cI am no longer free,\u201d she said in an interview with the Associated Press in 2018. \u201cI am not the same person I was before.\u201d With the help of Peru\u2019s Human Rights Ombudsman, Estrada won a lawsuit that gave her the right to die with euthanasia. From her bed, she participated in court sessions through video conferences. Estrada told judges in 2022 that she valued life, and did not want to die immediately, but wanted to have the freedom to decide when to end her life. \u201cI want to accede to euthanasia when I can no longer sustain suffering in life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when I decide to bid farewell to my loved ones in peace and with tranquility.\u201d Only a handful of countries have legalized euthanasia, including Canada, Belgium and Spain. Some U.S. states, including Maine and Oregon, allow physician-assisted suicide, where a doctor provides a terminally ill patient with the means to end their life. Euthanasia is illegal in most Latin American countries except for Colombia, which legalized it in 2015, and Ecuador, which decriminalized the practice in February. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

A U.S. defense official said there were no injuries to U.S. military personnel and no damage to aircraft involved in the raid. \"Coalition forces detained a senior Daesh leader during an operation in Syria June 16,\" Operation Inherent Resolve said in a statement. \"The detained individual was assessed to be an experienced bomb maker and facilitator who became one of the group's top leaders in Syria.\" A U.S. official told ABC News the name of the ISIS leader captured in the raid is Hani Ahmed al-Kurdi and described him as actively planning ISIS operations. \u201cThough degraded, ISIS remains a threat. We remain dedicated to its defeat. Last night\u2019s operation, which took a senior ISIS operator off the battlefield, demonstrates our commitment to the security of the Middle East and to the enduring defeat of ISIS,\u201d said Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, in a statement provided to ABC News. U.S. military ground raids into northwestern Syria are risky because they are carried out far west from U.S. bases in eastern Syria in areas that are controlled either by extremists or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. \"The mission was meticulously planned to minimize the risk of collateral damage, particularly any potential harm to civilians,\" OIR said. \"There were no civilians harmed during the operation nor any damage to Coalition aircraft or assets.\" MORE: Kansas woman pleads guilty to leading ISIS battalion U.S. military ground operations in northwestern Syria have targeted top ISIS leaders, most notably Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , who killed himself during an October 2019 raid near the border with Turkey that was carried out by the elite Delta Force. His successor, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi , detonated himself with an explosion during a similar raid in February this year. MORE: Biden details US raid in Syria that left ISIS leader dead \"Coalition forces will continue to work with our partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Iraqi Security Forces, including the Peshmerga, to hunt the remnants of Daesh wherever they hide to ensure Daesh's enduring defeat.,\" Operation Inherent Resolve added. Daesh is another name used to describe ISIS. The terror group was militarily defeated in Syria in 2019 and since then, its leaders have gone into hiding to prevent being targeted by U.S. forces. However, ISIS fighters maintain a low-level insurgency in Iraq and Syria, and the group continues to inspire followers in the West to commit violent attacks. In January, ISIS mounted its largest operation since its military defeat, as hundreds of ISIS fighters attempted to free thousands of terrorist fighters detained at a prison in Hasakah in northeast Syria. After 10 days of heavy fighting, U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces, helped by U.S. airstrikes, were able to retake the prison, though it is believed that several hundred ISIS prisoners were able to flee. Kurdish forces claimed that 374 ISIS fighters had been killed during the attempted prison break.",

This initiative is expected to be one of Melania Trump\u2019s top priorities, White said, and she is set to support it with \u201cupcoming activities\" -- which would mark a notable contrast given how little Melania Trump has campaigned on behalf of her husband in either 2016 or 2020. (The Trump campaign did not provide more details about possible events for conservative gay and lesbian voters.) \u201cThey hear us, they see us, and they love us,\u201d White said of the Trumps' message to Log Cabin Republicans on Saturday night. The announcement of Melania Trump's involvement with the Log Cabin Republicans initiative comes after months of her staying away from the public spotlight as her husband's third presidential bid heats up. She has, however, maintained some of her own initiatives -- speaking at a naturalization ceremony for new U.S. citizens in December; some charity work like with a local foster care organization in 2021; and launching a line of digital collectibles, a line of Christmas ornaments and, more recently, a Mother's Day-themed necklace for $245. The last two times she was seen publicly on the trail were at a major Palm Beach, Florida, fundraiser for Donald Trump and Republicans earlier this month, where organizers said they raised more than $50 million; and last month at a Palm Beach polling location where the former president voted in the Florida Republican primary. White told ABC News the initiative for gay Republicans is expected to involve \u201cdigital footprints in all of the key swing states,\u201d as well as \u201cextensive research and development into who we need to be communicating with and how we will communicate with them\u201d -- an effort to persuade the gay and lesbian community in America that \u201cDonald Trump is the best choice for all of us.\u201d Polling shows that he has notably lagged with those voters in the past. Rival Joe Biden won self-identified members of the LGBTQ+ community over Trump, 64-27%, exit polls showed. But that was a slight improvement for Trump compared with 2016, when he got only 14%. While the former president differentiated himself from some other leading conservatives in embracing gay people , his anti-trans positions have drawn broader outcry from the LGBTQ+ community.

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a 2022 regulation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that determined the sale of weapons kits requires a background check and serialization of the parts for law enforcement tracking.

Parts of a ghost gun kit are on display at an event held by President Joe Biden to announce measures to fight ghost gun crime, at the White House in Washington, D.C., April 11, 2022. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters, FILE The case will not be heard before the court until the fall. The Supreme Court had granted a stay reinstating the federal regulation on ghost guns in August 2023, putting on hold a ruling by a federal judge in Texas that had struck down the rule, while the Department of Justice appealed to the 5th Circuit. The 5th Circuit, which is made up of three appointees of former President Donald Trump, then largely upheld the Texas judge's ruling.

            "date": "2024-04-21 12:20:00",
            "content": "Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer is pushing back on claims that the institution has become increasingly political , reflecting the partisan divides in America at large as the high court weighs in on Donald Trump's candidacy , abortion access and more. \"I've not seen politics in the court, and I've been a judge for 40 years,\" Breyer told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl in an interview that aired Sunday. \"Not politics in the sense in which I understood that word when I worked for Sen. [Ted] Kennedy. ... No, that isn't there. That just isn't there.\" Breyer, who retired in 2022, is the author of the new book \"Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism, Not Textualism.\" Over his nearly three decades on the high court, Breyer saw its ideological balance shift more to the right and the justices now split 6-3 between conservatives and liberals. But the judges' decisions don't match the ideological divides seen in the White House and in Congress, Breyer said. Rather, the justices are driven by their interpretations of the law and Constitution, their relationships with each other -- and, to some extent, an awareness of how they are seen by the public. Appearing on \"This Week,\" he addressed some of the broad dynamics at the court but avoided commenting directly on its decisions, including overruling Roe v. Wade's guarantees to national abortion access in 2022 or, earlier this year, unanimously ruling that former President Trump can remain on the 2024 ballot following challenges to his candidacy under the Constitution's \"insurrection clause.\" That case thrust the Supreme Court into the middle of a presidential election in a way that it hadn't been for nearly a quarter of a century, since the landmark Bush v. Gore ruling settled the 2000 presidential election. Breyer wrote in his dissent at the time that he didn't believe the court should have taken up the matter. He said on \"This Week\" that dissents have real value -- but that unanimous rulings, as happened in the Trump ballot challenge, carry weight, too. Justice Stephen Breyer appears on ABC News This Week. ABC News \"I always thought, well, it doesn't hurt to publish these things [dissents]. It puts out another point of view. It shows people, which they would believe anyway, that not everybody's in agreement,\" he said. \"But there's also something to be said to try to keep down the extent to which you publicly reveal the disagreement.\" The Supreme Court this week will take up another Trump case with potentially vast legal and political ramifications: whether presidents have immunity from prosecution for conducting their official duties -- and whether Trump's challenges to his 2020 election loss fell within his official duties. If the justices side with Trump, that could upend two of the four criminal cases against him, though prosecutors maintain that his alleged criminal acts should fall outside of any immunity. He denies all wrongdoing. On \"This Week,\" Breyer was firm in his view when Karl questioned whether or not the court wanted to add to the political divide within the country: \"No, God of course not. But you're looking for an easy answer when -- I'm not being coy, [but I'm] saying, 'No, there aren't easy answers.'\" Related Stories 'This Week' Transcript 4-21-24: Michael McCaul Apr 21, 9:50 AM 'Civil War\u2019 continues box-office campaign at No. 1 Apr 21, 12:52 PM Can abortion help Democrats flip Florida? Apr 23, 5:03 AM Pressed by Karl about whether the justices privately weigh strategically ruling as a bloc on some cases, like on Trump's ballot access or the immunity question, in order to present a bipartisan consensus to the public, Breyer demurred. He said that there are certainly delicate deliberations among the justices: \"It may be that you can find a compromise in the conference or a way of approaching things in the conference that will, in fact, solve a number of problems. And that could be one of the problems.\" But he insisted there wasn't the kind of horse-trading Karl referenced. \"[Former Justice] Sandra O'Connor used to say this: The first unwritten rule is nobody speaks twice 'til everyone speaks once. Second unwritten rule: Tomorrow is another day. You and I were the greatest of allies on case one. Case two, we're absolutely at loggerheads,\" he said. Justice Stephen Breyer appears on ABC News This Week. ABC News Breyer also challenged the idea, increasingly prevalent among the conservative-leaning justices, that the courts should only focus on the text of statutes and the Constitution to determine the outcomes of cases, a legal theory known as textualism. As he highlights in his book, Breyer believes that judges must consider other factors when interpreting laws, too, including who wrote them, why they were written, how they reflect the values of the Constitution and the practical consequences of court decisions. \"Who wrote those words and what did they have in mind? What was Congress trying to do? What are the consequences if you go one way rather than another way? How does it fit into a set of values that begins with the Constitution?\" Breyer said. \"Judges have always done that kind of thing.\" That ideology is directly at odds with the textualist approach highlighted in the 2022 overruling of Roe in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case. In the majority ruling, Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote that, \"We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today's decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision.\" Despite acknowledging that the court's decisions will directly impact society at large, Breyer said that factor doesn't lead the decision-making process for justices. \"I would say that's in your mind,\" he said. \"When you say -- does that lead to your deciding X rather than not X? Well, I can never say never, but rarely.\" He quoted the late constitutional law professor Paul Freund. \"No judge should or will be moved by the temperature of the day, but every judge will be aware of the climate of the season.\"",

            "date": "2024-04-21 14:59:00",
            "content": "The $95 billion foreign aid package that passed the House on Saturday included legislation to force a sale of TikTok by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. If the measure becomes law and if that sale then doesn't occur within a year, the app would be banned in the U.S. amid widespread data-sharing and foreign influence fears -- which TikTok says are baseless . So, what's next for the push to divest or ban the hugely popular social media platform in the U.S.? The future in the Senate and beyond The Senate plans to take up the foreign aid package this week, starting Tuesday, putting it on track for final passage by midweek. The campaign to force TikTok to be divested or be banned has earned broad bipartisan support, with lawmakers echoing worries that TikTok could harvest Americans' user data for Beijing -- or be used as a vehicle to spread Chinese propaganda. House Speaker Mike Johnson hailed an earlier version of the sell-or-ban bill that passed the House in March , saying it \"demonstrates Congress' opposition to Communist China's attempts to spy on and manipulate Americans, and signals our resolve to deter our enemies.\" Some supporters of divestment also note that China already restricts hugely popular American platforms like YouTube in their country. TikTok has defended its data management at length , saying U.S. user traffic flows through a third party within the U.S., along with additional oversight protections. The TikTok logo is displayed outside TikTok social media app company offices in Culver City, Calif., on March 16, 2023. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images, FILE ByteDance is \"not owned or controlled by any government or state entity,\" TikTok says, though skeptics believe ByteDance could hypothetically be forced under Chinese law to comply with the government there. While there are some critics on Capitol Hill of the push against TikTok, the divestment-or-ban legislation continues to gain steam, and the White House said President Joe Biden would sign the earlier version of the bill. High-profile Democrats like Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell of Washington have now signaled support for the TikTok provision, too. Cantwell was an obstacle to the House's previous bill to force a sale or ban of TikTok, which passed in March and then stalled in the Senate. But she's since come around, saying last week that House Republicans earned her support by amending their legislation to extend the deadline for when ByteDance would be required to sell the app from six months to a year after the law were to go into effect. The TikTok measure could still be stripped out of the foreign aid legislation in the Senate, but that would require the entire package to be sent back to the House for another vote -- at the same time that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have stressed urgency for acting on the additional money for Ukraine and Israel. Related Stories Senate passes bill forcing TikTok's parent company to sell or face ban, sends to Biden for signature Apr 23, 9:42 PM A bill that could ban TikTok advances to the Senate. What\u2019s next? Mar 8, 3:39 PM TikTok ban included in aid package: What's next? Apr 18, 3:20 PM The app is working to \"educate lawmakers,\" a source told ABC News. The company has mounted aggressive efforts to sway lawmakers to their position, but it's unclear what their strategy is now. In a statement, TikTok slammed the renewed efforts behind divestment. \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" the platform said. TikTok would likely sue to block the divestment legislation from going into effect at the end of the one-year sale window. Rep. Ro Khanna, a progressive Democrat from California, didn't support the legislation in the House and predicted Sunday on ABC News' \"This Week\" that \"I don't think it's going to pass First Amendment scrutiny [by the courts] because I think there are less restrictive alternatives.\" A man carries a Free TikTok sign in front of the courthouse where the hush-money trial of Donald Trump got underway April 15, 2024, in New York. Ted Shaffrey/AP What would China do? In March, China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao indicated officials would seek to block any transfer of the app's technology, saying the country would \"firmly oppose\" a forced sale. Of perhaps the greatest concern is the app's algorithm, seen as essential to its popularity in surfacing viral video content. Users are already familiar with the algorithm's success, even if they don't realize that's what allows the app to feed users a never-ending stream of videos related to their interests. Selling TikTok without that technology would be like selling a car without an engine. What are TikTokers saying? Many TikTokers say they oppose the legislation, which could upend their digital media careers and businesses, and they are making their voices heard. A group of about 50 held a demonstration in front of the Capitol while the House voted on the package on Saturday. A group of 30-plus creators also recently signed an open letter to President Joe Biden warning him that taking action against the app would be a \"serious error\" that could be \"alienating young voters\" in this election year. Another group of TikTok creators are planning to rally outside the Capitol on Tuesday.",

            "title": "Abortion could dominate the 2024 election in Florida. Will that help Democrats flip the state?",
            "date": "2024-04-23 05:03:00",
            "content": "For decades, with only a few exceptions, Florida has been one of the most closely fought states in presidential elections -- famously helping George W. Bush beat Al Gore in 2000 by just 537 votes. Some of the state's other big races were often just as close. But Florida appeared to be shifting rapidly to the right since 2020, with Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, cruising to reelection by nearly 20 points. Now, however, as voters gear up for the next presidential election, state Democrats hope to put Florida back in play with the help of abortion access -- which will be put directly before voters on the same November ballot with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, \"Our agenda, our coalition, and the unique dynamics this election presents make it clear: President Biden is in a stronger position to win Florida this cycle than he was in 2020,\" Biden's campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, wrote in a memo in early April, underscoring the cautious optimism among some in her party. Rodriguez and other Biden aides have made this pitch: Floridians have rejected \"MAGA politics\" since the 2022 midterms and Biden is in a good position to \"assemble a winning coalition\" of key voter groups in the state: seniors, Hispanic voters, Black voters and voters who previously supported GOP candidate Nikki Haley over Trump in the 2024 primary. Beyond abortion, Rodriguez singled out issues like the cost of living, health care access and welfare programs like Social Security. \"Make no mistake: Florida is not an easy state to win,\" she wrote in her memo, in part, \"but it is a winnable one.\" Recent history, including DeSantis' big win in 2022 and Trump's back-to-back victories in 2016 and 2020, undercuts that, observers say. DeSantis also signed the state's 15-week and six-week abortion bans and was embraced by voters. But those races were all held either before or just after the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative-leaning majority overruled Roe v. Wade. Since then, 21 states have banned or severely restricted access to abortion -- including Florida, where the six-week restriction, with some exceptions, is set to take effect at the end of this month. In the two years after Roe was reversed, a number of red and blue states have also put abortion-related ballot initiatives before voters. Abortion access has won in each case, from California to Kentucky, Kansas to Maine, Ohio to Vermont. Florida voters are set to cast votes in November on their own abortion ballot question, which would amend the state's constitution and guarantee broader access to the procedure. National and state Democrats welcomed the news early this month that the Florida Supreme Court would allow the abortion ballot initiative to appear on the state's ballot this year, with many arguing, including Biden's campaign, that that will boost voter turnout and enthusiasm for pro-abortion rights candidates and favor Democrats, as it has elsewhere. President Joe Biden speaks, April 22, 2022, in Seattle. Andrew Harnik/AP Biden will travel to Tampa, Florida on Tuesday to give a speech on reproductive rights exactly one week before the state's six-week abortion ban kicks in. But Florida Democrats are also aware of the uphill battle ahead of them in November. Of the nearly 13.5 million people registered to vote in the state, 5.2 million are registered as Republicans, while 4.3 million are registered as Democrats, a difference of about 900,000 voters, according to state data. After decades of Democrats holding an official edge with voter registration in the state, that flipped starting in 2021. There are also 3.5 million voters in the state who are not registered with either major party. Evan Power, the chair of the Florida GOP, contended that abortion isn't the issue to tip the state in the opposing party's favor. \"Democrats made [abortion] the No. 1 issue that they ran in on in Florida in 2022 and we won by 19% of the votes,\" Power told ABC News. Referring to the six-week ban, he said, \"This is what the voters sent their legislators to Tallahassee to deliver on and they did deliver on it. So I don't think there's a backlash coming in at all.\" Related Stories Biden blames Trump for Florida's 6-week abortion ban, says women nationwide face health crisis Apr 23, 12:19 AM Arizona House advances a repeal of the state's near-total abortion ban to the Senate Apr 24, 12:06 AM Florida's Bob Graham dead at 87: A leader who looked beyond politics, served ordinary folks Apr 17, 3:30 PM Florida Democrats still insist that the state is \"winnable\" this election cycle, telling ABC News that the abortion ballot initiative is energizing voters. \"We were already seeing momentum in Florida before this ruling and, look, I think that the reality is, as the Biden campaign says, Florida is winnable and that this puts us on the map for the rest of the nation,\" Florida Democratic Party spokesperson Andrew Feldman said. Both the Biden campaign and state Democrats have cited some special and local elections since 2022 as evidence that Florida remains competitive, like in decades past. Last May, Democrats flipped Jacksonville's mayoral office for the first time in 30 years when former TV news anchor Donna Deegan, who was endorsed by abortion advocates, defeated Daniel Davis, the CEO of the JAX Chamber pro-business group. Abortion rights activists participate in the \"Rally for Our Freedom\" to protect abortion rights for Floridians, in Orlando, Florida, on April 13, 2024. Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images Still, Florida Republicans say they have made vast gains in the state over the past few years, thanks to the support of voters, which will be difficult for Democrats to overcome. DeSantis has been perhaps the biggest winner of the GOP's ascendancy in state. He defeated former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist by double digits two years ago, a few months after the Roe ruling. MORE: Florida voters will get to consider abortion rights ballot measure in November, court rules However, some others call the 2022 midterms in Florida an \"outlier\" when anticipating how close the state could be in the 2024 general election. Justin Sayfie, a government relations consultant at Ballard Partners and former spokesperson for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, said that he believes DeSantis' resounding victory in 2022 came from those who supported his COVID-19 policies in keeping the state open during the pandemic. With the virus now largely faded from public view, Sayfie said that won't be a significant factor in how people vote this year -- and so the proposed abortion amendment on Florida's ballot will grab more attention and make the presidential election more competitive than it would have otherwise. He cited the last four elections: two in which Barack Obama won; two in which Trump won. \"Donald Trump's victory in 2020 was only by 3 points, so I think Florida is a competitive state,\" Sayfie said. \"And having reproductive rights on the ballot ... is a net plus for Democrats.\" Florida GOP Vice Chair Evan Power speaks to reporters, Dec. 17, 2023. Zac Anderson/USAToday Network Feldman, with the state Democrats, argued that the 2022 midterm elections were also an anomaly and that Florida's Democratic Party was less organized than it is now. \"We're the first people to say it; we were not in the game,\" Feldman said. \"We did not have an operation that did what Democrats do best in terms of turning out voters, in terms of coordinating, and we are getting back to a time now in Florida where we were in [during the] Obama years.\" In an interview, 538 senior elections analyst and senior editor Nathaniel Rakich said Florida is in the range of winnability for Democrats but that the state is \"slightly Republican-leaning.\" With Biden doing well in fundraising for his reelection campaign, Rakich said it's not crazy for the president to put in effort in Florida, noting Biden's relatively small margin of defeat in the state in 2020 and that what partly contributed to the so-called red wave there in 2022 was low Democratic turnout. \"I think people just have poor political memories and then look at 2022 and 2020 in Florida and they say oh that the state is gone,\" Rakich said. \"But sometimes, you know, states kind of go off on little tangents in their political journey -- but then they kind of come back to the main road.\" Editor's note: This story has been updated.

More Republicans, including House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, voted against the Ukraine aid bill than for it over the weekend. Greene would need only one other Republican to join her in ousting Johnson, as happened last year to Kevin McCarthy, unless enough Democrats side with him. According to Khanna on Sunday, they will -- even absent additional concessions. \"Would you and fellow Democrats that will protect him at this moment -- ask for anything in return?\" Karl pressed. \"I'll leave the negotiations to ... [Minority Leader Hakeem] Jeffries, but I don't think everything in politics needs to be transactional,\" Khanna said. \"I think here you have Speaker Johnson, who not only put this up for a vote but he also separated the bills, which I thought was courageous. He let people vote their conscience on Taiwan, on the offensive aid to Israel, on Ukraine. And I give him credit for that.\" The House votes on Saturday -- advancing the four foreign aid bills for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific allies -- marked a dramatic reversal for Republican leaders like Johnson, who for months have said additional funds to Ukraine must be tied to a tightening of U.S. border and immigration laws. But efforts to broker compromise on that point failed to win over enough conservatives. A high-profile agreement in the Senate to overhaul border policy was quickly rejected by Johnson and others as insufficient after opposition from former President Donald Trump. And then, earlier this month, Johnson announced his support for individual votes on additional aid, including to Ukraine as well as to Israel, currently at war with Hamas. \"To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\" Johnson said last week, invoking his own son, who is going to the Naval Academy. On \"This Week,\" McCaul was pressed by Karl over Johnson's changing views -- and the lengthy delay involved in the legislative process, to ultimately end up with Congress backing a similar amount of aid as the White House first proposed last year. McCaul said that Johnson initially supported the position of hard-line Republicans but recognized that with the government divided, another path had to be chosen. \"He tried to do what the, you know, say the Freedom Caucus wanted him to do. It wasn't going to work in the Senate or the White House,\" McCaul said. \"At the end of the day, we were running out of time. Ukraine's getting ready to fall.\" Johnson's classified briefings and hearing from Republican leaders on the issue like House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner had influenced his thinking, McCaul said. He signaled that, essentially, Johnson, once a little-known legislator, had to learn on the job after being thrust into the speakership in the fall amid a chaotic power struggle within the GOP's House conference.

Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/Reuters \"The stock in Mike Johnson's gone way up. I think the respect for him's gone way up because he did the right thing irrespective of his job. That garnered a lot of respect,\" McCaul continued. \"And also from the Democrat side.\" Beyond just the foreign aid bills that were approved on Saturday, Johnson has had to repeatedly use the votes of the Democratic minority in order to move forward on some key legislation, like government funding. That's because Republicans hold only a very narrow majority of a few votes but have been unable to reach consensus among themselves on various bills. Asked on \"This Week\" if such a dynamic indicates the House is actually now in some kind of \"coalition government,\" McCaul replied, \"I don't know, maybe some people like that.\" He then dinged lawmakers like Greene for her ultimatum against Johnson. \"When the motion gets threatened every week in the Congress, that is being abused,\" McCaul said. \"And I think we need to fix that. That is a tool that's being abused by a minority when the majority of my conference don't agree with them.\" He said that on the issue of Ukraine aid, Republican colleagues like Greene, who decry more aid as a waste over major domestic problems, \"bought into this notion that it's an either/or proposition. ... You can't support Ukraine without the border. We can do both. We're a great nation. Now we are stuck in a political issue here.\" \"The eyes of the world are watching and our adversaries are watching and history is watching,\" he went on to say. \"And that's what I kept telling my colleagues.\" Rep. Khanna, in his separate interview, expanded on his views on another big part of the aid votes this weekend: more money for Israel as it fights Hamas in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack sparked a war. Khanna was one of 37 Democrats who voted against the individual aid bill for Israel, but he sought to draw a contrast between his opposition for offensive funds versus defensive funds to allow Israel to protect itself. \"It was a hard vote. I mean, look, it -- this was a stance against a blank check for [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and offensive weapons unconditionally while he's talking about going into Rafah ... when we know more women and children are going to die,\" Khanna said, echoing the increasing criticism that Israel's bombardment of Gaza cities has killed far too many civilians. (Israel insists it takes steps to protect civilians.) \"We wanted to make it clear that there has to be a change in strategy and no more famine and suffering in Gaza,\" Khanna said, continuing: \"So why are we giving this unconditionally to Netanyahu when the entire world is saying that there's famine there, that we need a new strategy, that we need release of the hostages [thought to be held by Hamas] and peace?\" Pressed by Karl on his vote against funding for Israel in the wake of Iran's direct strikes on the country this month -- marking a new phase in what has long been seen as a shadow war between them -- Khanna said he would have supported strictly defense-related monies. The goal, however, should be an end to the fighting through coalition building in the region, he said. \"The reality is, until we have a security cooperation effort, a diplomatic architecture in the Middle East, with Iran, with Saudi Arabia, with Israel, you're never going to get peace,\" he said. Khanna also took a skeptical view of the legislative push to force TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell it or face a ban in the U.S. amid data security and foreign influence concerns, which TikTok calls baseless. \"I don't think it's going to pass First Amendment scrutiny because I think there are less restrictive alternatives. ... I doubt it survives scrutiny in the Supreme Court,\" Khanna predicted.",

The case, City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, carries enormous stakes nationwide as communities confront a growing tide of unhoused residents and increasingly turn to punitive measures to try to incentivize people to take advantage of social services and other shelter options. \"These generally applicable laws prohibit specific conduct and are essential to public health and safety,\" argued the city's attorney Theane Evangelis during oral arguments, which stretched more than two and a half hours. Homeless rights activists hold a rally outside of the U.S. Supreme Court, Apr. 22, 2024, in Washington. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images MORE: Supreme Court to decide if ban on homeless encampments is 'cruel and unusual' The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a decision last year that a homeless camping ban amounts to \"cruel and unusual punishment\" under the 8th Amendment. But several members of the high court's conservative majority took a critical view of that conclusion. \"Have we ever applied the Eighth Amendment to civil penalties?\" asked a skeptical Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Amy Coney Barrett worried about where to draw the line, wondering aloud whether the Eighth Amendment could reasonably be invoked to prohibit punishment for hungry people who steal food or engage in other behaviors necessary for survival. \"How do we draw these difficult lines about, you know, public urination and those sorts of things?\" she said.

Jenny Kane/AP MORE: 'You can't be accurate': Annual count of US homeless population misses large numbers of people, experts warn Many appeared to reject claims that the Grants Pass ordinance and others like it criminalize a person based their experience of involuntary homelessness, rather than for a concrete action. Supreme Court precedent has said it's unconstitutional to punish someone for a relatively immutable quality, like drug addiction. \"What if the person finds that person in a homeless state because of prior life choices or their refusal to make future life choices?\" asked Justice Samuel Alito. Some conservative justices, while empathetic to the plight of the unhoused, suggested that local officials -- not courts -- are best positioned to grapple with the complicated issue of homelessness. \"This is a serious policy problem,\" said Chief Justice John Roberts, \"and it's a policy problem because the solution, of course, is to build shelter to provide shelter for those who are otherwise harmless. But, municipalities have competing priorities ... Why would you think this these nine people are the best people to judge and weigh those policy judgments?\" Demonstrators hold signs and use reflective blankets during a protest outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Apr. 22, 2024. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images MORE: California lawmakers try to address homelessness with new proposed encampment ban The court's three liberal justices -- clearly breaking with the majority of justices -- forcefully defended the rights of homeless people to camp in public places, likening the Grants Pass law to cruelly punishing someone's basic need.

Are they supposed to kill themselves not sleeping?\" Backers of the law say many individuals who've camped in city parks have chosen not to take an available bed in the town's Gospel Rescue Mission -- a private shelter in city limits -- which is only half full but requires residents to attend worship services, give up pets and pledge not to smoke or drink. The lead plaintiff in the case refused a shelter bed because she wanted to remain outside with her dog. Grants Pass has no public homeless shelters. Chief Roberts asked whether a nearby town's shelter capacity, or whether a person's decision to decline a bed, should be taken into consideration. \"Let's say there are five cities all around Grants Pass and they all have homeless shelters, and yet the person wants to stay [in the camp]?\" Roberts asked. \"Can that person be given a citation?\" Justice Alito questioned the practicality of determining the number available beds before a citation is issued to a person sleeping in a park, suggesting the lower court decision created an unworkable situation for law enforcement. \"What is an individual police officer supposed to do?\" he asked. \"Count the number of people who are getting ready to sleep outside for the night, and then ask each one of them whether you've tried to find a bed at a shelter?\" Cassy Leach, right, leads a group of volunteers to check on homeless people living in Baker Park, Mar. 21, 2024, in Grants Pass, Ore. Jenny Kane/AP MORE: Amount of homeless people with mental illness increased slightly in recent years, but experts say they're more visible: Analysis Pressing the limits of the constitutional argument against the Oregon city's ordinance, Justice Neil Gorsuch asked if there might be a right to defecate and urinate in public if bathrooms aren't available to the homeless. Key to the argument is whether Grants Pass treats homelessness as a \"status.\" Doing so could run afoul of a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, which held that it violated the Eighth Amendment to make drug addiction as a \"status\" illegal. \"Homelessness is not something that you do. It's just something that you are,\" argued attorney Kelsi Corkran, representing the homeless plaintiffs. The Oregon law's defenders say the ordinance merely criminalizes the conduct of camping in public, not the fact that the camper has no home. They also argue that the state allows for a \"necessity\" defense, which those charged with violating the city's ordinance could pursue if they could show they truly had nowhere else to go. The Biden administration is asking the court to remand the case for further evidentiary findings before a final ruling is made. A decision is expected by the end of June.",

ABC News A debate over homeless encampments familiar to many communities headed to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, where the justices confronted a rising tide of unhoused Americans and punitive steps cities like Grants Pass are increasingly taking to address it. In 2013, the Grants Pass city council attempted to ban anyone \u201cfrom using a blanket, pillow or cardboard box for protection from the elements\u201d while sleeping outside under threat of civil citation. Two federal courts put the measure on hold after finding it \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d under the Eighth Amendment to ticket people with no alternative to survive. MORE: Annual count of US homeless population misses large numbers of people, experts warn \u201cInvoluntarily homeless people are punished for engaging in the unavoidable acts of sleeping or resting in a public place when they have nowhere else to go,\u201d a district court concluded in 2020. There are no public homeless shelters in Grants Pass, which has a population of nearly 40,000. An estimated 600 residents are experiencing homelessness. Ed Johnson, an attorney with the Oregon Law Center, wants the U.S. Supreme Court to call it unconstitutional \"cruel and unusual punishment\" to impose civil or criminal penalties on homeless people with nowhere else to go. ABC News \u201cWe all want to solve homelessness, but criminalizing our neighbors who\u2019ve been forced to live outside is not the way to do it. It will not work; it will make matters worse,\u201d said attorney Ed Johnson at the Oregon Law Center, which represents a group of Grants Pass homeless residents. In City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, the nation\u2019s highest court is being asked to decide whether ticketing homeless people is patently unconstitutional -- the most significant legal dispute over homelessness in America in more than 40 years. \"This case is about giving cities the tools that they need to address the urgent homelessness crisis,\" said Theane Evangelis, an attorney representing the city before the Supreme Court. \"We believe that it's cruel to allow these conditions to continue, and that cities need to have the flexibility to address all of the circumstances as they work on long term solutions to homelessness.\" The case also has sweeping implications for those living on the streets, advocates say. \u201cThe stakes are really high,\u201d said Ann Olivia, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. \u201cWhat the data tells us, what the evidence tells us, what our humanity tells us, is that moving people around because you don\u2019t want to see them is not the answer.\u201d Since a federal court blocked a ban on public camping by homeless people, fewer unhoused residents have been taking advantage of private shelter beds in Grants Pass, Ore. ABC News Soaring home and rent prices have eaten into incomes and priced some people out of the market. The situation has been compounded by sunsetting COVID relief programs; an ongoing mental health and drug abuse crisis; and, an aging population without retirement savings. Adding to that financial burden -- and giving some people a criminal record -- by ticketing them for camping is counterproductive, homeless advocates contend.

Residents are required to attend religious services; quit smoking, drinking, and drug use; and, give up their pets. The facility -- which has 78 beds to house homeless men -- is only half full. \u201cWe've seen a drop in our residency, and we've seen an increase in people in our parks and freeway underpasses and that kind of stuff in places where they ought not be,\u201d because the courts put the camping ban on hold, he said. State Rep. Dwayne Yunker of Grants Pass, Ore., says cities need to have the ability to enact public camping bans to protect health and safety.

            "content": "Former President Donald Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records after being indicted by a Manhattan grand jury. In court documents unsealed last year, prosecutors alleged Trump engaged in a \"scheme\" to boost his chances during the 2016 presidential election through a series of hush money payments made by others and the falsification of New York business records to cover up that alleged criminal conduct. In a statement of facts accompanying the indictment, Manhattan prosecutors allege Trump made payments to his lawyer to reimburse him for a payment the lawyer made to one woman. Former President Donald Trump leaves the courtroom at the Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on Apr. 4, 2023. Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Images Trump, who has denied all wrongdoing, pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts. Here is a timeline of the case, dating back to Trump's initial declaration as a candidate for president: June 16, 2015 Trump announces he is running for president. August 2015 Trump meets with David Pecker, then-chairman and CEO of American Media Inc. -- which owns the National Enquirer -- at Trump Tower in New York. Pecker agrees to help with Trump's campaign by looking out for negative stories about him to \"catch and kill,\" according to prosecutors' statement of facts. He also agrees to publish negative stories about Trump's competitors in the election, according to the statement of facts filed by the Manhattan DA. October/November 2015 Pecker learns that a former Trump Tower doorman was trying to sell information that Trump allegedly fathered a child out of wedlock, according to the statement of facts. At the CEO's direction, AMI negotiates and signs an agreement to pay the doorman $30,000 in exchange for acquiring exclusive rights to the story. AMI allegedly falsely characterized this payment in its general ledger, according to the statement of facts. AMI purchases the story without fully investigating the doorman's claims, at the direction of Pecker, per his alleged arrangement with Trump, according to the statement of facts. AMI later determines the story was not true and wanted to release the doorman from the agreement, but Lawyer A -- a Trump Organization lawyer believed to be Michael Cohen -- allegedly instructs him not to do so until after the presidential election, according to the statement of facts. June 2016 The National Enquirer's editor-in-chief and chief content officer contacted Cohen (Lawyer A) about a woman -- who is believed to be Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who alleged she had had a sexual relationship with Trump while he was married, according to the statement of facts. Cohen (Lawyer A) is updated by the National Enquirer about this regularly over text and by phone, according to the statement of facts. Trump allegedly did not want this information to become public because he was concerned what impact it may have on his campaign for president, according to the statement of facts. AMI ultimately pays the woman $150,000 in exchange for her not speaking out on the alleged sexual relationship. She would also get two magazine cover features and a series of articles published under her byline, according to the statement of facts. Prosecutors allege that this deal was made based on the understanding that Trump or the Trump Organization would reimburse AMI for the payment, according to the statement of facts. Trump has denied having the affair. September 2016 An audio recording allegedly captures a conversation between Trump and Cohen (Lawyer A) as they discuss how to obtain the rights to the woman's story from AMI and reimburse it for the payment, according to the statement of facts. Cohen (Lawyer A) allegedly tells Trump he will open a company for the transfer of the woman's account and said he had spoken to Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg about setting it up, according to the statement of facts. A shell company -- called Resolution Consultants, LLC -- is allegedly set up on about Sept. 30, 2016. On or about that date, Pecker signs an agreement transferring the rights of the woman's account to the shell company owned by Cohen (Lawyer A) for $125,000, according to court documents. But, before the reimbursement was made, Pecker consulted AMI's general counsel and then told Cohen (Lawyer A) that the deal was off. Oct. 7, 2016 News breaks that Trump was caught on tape in 2015 telling the host of the entertainment show \"Access Hollywood,\" \"I just start kissing them\u00a0[women].\u00a0It's\u00a0like a\u00a0magnet.\u00a0Just kiss.\u00a0I\u00a0don't even\u00a0wait.\u00a0And when\u00a0you're a\u00a0star, they let\u00a0you do it.\u00a0You can\u00a0do anything. ...\u00a0Grab 'em\u00a0by the [genitals].\u00a0You can do\u00a0anything.\" According to prosecutors, evidence shows that both Trump and his campaign staff were concerned the tape would harm his viability as a candidate and reduce his standing with female voters in particular. In a statement Trump released after the recording was leaked, he apologized and called his remarks \"locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.\" Oct. 10, 2016 AMI's editor-in-chief contacts Pecker about a second woman -- believed to be adult film actress Stormy Daniels -- who alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump while he was married, according to the statement of facts. Pecker tells the editor-in-chief to notify Cohen (Lawyer A).

The two then negotiate a deal to secure the woman's silence. The woman would be paid $130,000 for the rights to her story, according to the statement of facts. Trump allegedly tells Cohen (Lawyer A) to delay making a payment to the second woman for as long as possible, according to prosecutors. If he is able to delay making the payment until after the election, they could avoid paying altogether, Trump allegedly says, per prosecutors. Prosectors claim emails and text messages between both lawyers and the AMI editor-in-chief show they attempted to delay making the payment for as long as possible, according to the statement of facts. Ultimately, Trump agrees to the payoff and directs Cohen (Lawyer A) to proceed, prosecutors allege. Trump allegedly does not want to make the payment himself and asked Cohen (Lawyer A) and Weisselberg to find a way to make the payment, according to the statement of facts. Cohen (Lawyer A) makes the payment after confirming that Trump would pay him back. Oct. 26, 2016 Shortly after speaking with Trump over the phone, Cohen (Lawyer A) opens a bank account in Manhattan in the name of a shell company he had created to effectuate the payment, according to the statement of facts. Cohen (Lawyer A) then transfers $131,000 from his personal home equity line of credit into the account, according to court documents. Oct. 27, 2016 Cohen (Lawyer A) transfers $130,000 to a lawyer representing the second woman accusing Trump of having a sexual encounter with her while he was married to suppress her story, according to court documents. Nov. 8, 2016 Trump wins the presidential election. AMI then releases the doorman and the first accuser of their nondisclosure agreements, according to court documents. By Jan. 20, 2017 Prosecutors allege that between Election Day and Inauguration Day, Trump meets privately with Pecker in Trump Tower in Manhattan, thanking him for handling the stories of the doorman and the first woman, according to the statement of facts. Trump invites Pecker to the inauguration, according to the statement of facts. January 2017 Trump arranges to reimburse Cohen (Lawyer A) for the payoff he made on his behalf shortly after being elected president, according to the statement of facts. Cohen (Lawyer A) meets with Weisselberg to discus how he would be reimbursed, with Weisselberg asking Cohen to bring a copy of a bank statement for the shell company account showing the $130,000 payment, according to the statement of facts. MORE: The Manhattan DA's investigation into Trump and the Stormy Daniels hush payment, explained Weisselberg and Cohen (Lawyer A) agree to a total repayment amount of $420,000. That figure reflected double the $130,000 payment and $50,000 reimbursement for another expense in addition to a $60,000 year-end bonus -- so Cohen (Lawyer A) could characterize the payment as income on his tax returns instead of a reimbursement -- according to the statement of facts. Trump, Weisselberg and Cohen (Lawyer A) agree the lawyer would be paid the $420,000 through 12 monthly payments of $35,000 over the course of 2017, according to court documents. Cohen (Lawyer A) was to send an invoice to the Trump Org each month falsely requesting a payment of $35,000 for legal services rendered. Cohen (Lawyer A) does not have a retainer agreement with Trump or the Trump Organization, according to prosecutors. February 2017 Cohen (Lawyer A) meets with Trump in the Oval Office to confirm the repayment arrangement in February 2017, according to the statement of facts. Feb. 14, 2017 Cohen (Lawyer A) emails the Trump Organization the first monthly invoice requesting two $35,000 payments for January and February, which were allegedly approved by Weisselberg, according to the statement of facts. Throughout 2017 Cohen (Lawyer A) submits 10 similar invoices for the remaining months in 2017, but is not on retainer, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors allege the Trump Organization falsely recorded each payment as a \"legal expense,\" according to the statement of facts. According to prosecutors, the first check was paid from Trump's trust and signed by Weisselberg and Trump's son, as trustees. It was falsely recorded as payments for January and February 2017 legal services, according to the statement of facts. A second check, for March 2017, was also paid from the trust and signed by two trustees, according to the statement of facts. The remaining nine checks, for April through December 2017, were paid by Trump personally, according to the statement of facts. Trump allegedly signed each of the checks personally and had them sent to the Trump Organization in New York. They were then scanned and maintained in its data system before being detached and mailed to Cohen (Lawyer A), according to the statement of facts. The last $35,000 payment made was for December 2017, according to the statement of facts. Summer 2017 Trump invites Pecker to the White House for dinner to thank him for his help during the campaign, according to the statement of facts. April 9, 2018 The FBI executes a search warrant on Cohen's residences and office , according to a statement of facts. Prosecutors allege that in the months that followed, Trump and others engaged in a public and private pressure campaign to try to ensure that Cohen did not cooperate with law enforcement in the federal investigation. Cohen (Lawyer A) speaks with Trump on the day of the FBI searches, according to prosecutors. Trump allegedly told him to \"stay strong,\" according to the statement of facts. April 21, 2018 Trump publicly encourages Cohen not to \"flip\" in a series of tweets saying, \"Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that.\" Mid-April 2018 Cohen (Lawyer A) is approached by an attorney -- Lawyer C -- who offers to represent him in the interest of maintaining a \"back channel of communication\" to Trump, according to the statement of facts. On April 21, 2018, Lawyer C allegedly emails Cohen (Lawyer A) stating that he has a close relationship with Trump's personal attorney, named as Lawyer D, according to the statement of facts. June 14, 2018 Lawyer C emails Cohen (Lawyer A) a news clip discussing the possibility of him cooperating with law enforcement, encouraging him not to, according to the statement of facts. \"The whole objective of this\u00a0exercise by the [federal prosecutors] is to drain you, emotionally and financially, until you reach a point that you see them as your only means to salvation,\" Lawyer C wrote in the email, according to the statement of facts. In the same email, Lawyer C wrote, \"You are making a\u00a0very big mistake if you believe\u00a0the stories\u00a0these 'journalists'\u00a0are writing about\u00a0you.\u00a0They want you to\u00a0cave.\u00a0They want you to fail.\u00a0They do not want\u00a0you to persevere\u00a0and succeed,\" according to the statement of facts. July 2, 2018 In an in-depth interview that airs on \"Good Morning America,\" his first since the FBI raided his office and homes in April, Cohen strongly signals his willingness to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York -- even if that puts Trump in jeopardy. \"My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will,\" Cohen tells ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. \"I put family and country first.\" Aug. 21, 2018 Cohen pleads guilty in the federal investigation admitting to his role in AMI's payoff to McDougal (Woman 1) to influence the election, according to the indictment, and saying in his plea that he had done so at Trump's direction. Cohen also pleads guilty in connection with his payoff of Daniels to secure her silence, claiming it was done at Trump's direction, according to the statement of facts. Trump comments on Twitter saying, \"If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen!\" September 2018 Cohen and AMI admit guilt in connection with the payoffs made to the two women claiming Trump had extramarital relations with them, according to the statement of facts. AMI entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in connection to the payoff made to Woman 1, admitting it did not intend to publish a story at any time during the negotiation or acquisition of her story, the practice known as \"catch and kill,\" according to the statement of facts. Nov. 3, 2020 After a bitter campaign for reelection, Trump goes head to head with Joe Biden on Election Day. Four days later, it's clear Trump has lost after ABC News projects Pennsylvania for Biden. March 2021 Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance announces he will not seek reelection after 12 years in office, with the investigation into Trump still ongoing. His office had begun to look into hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels in 2018. Nov. 2, 2021 Alvin Bragg is elected district attorney in Manhattan. Once in office, he picks up the investigation into Trump . Bragg had led the investigation into the Trump Foundation in 2017 under then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman for \"extensive unlawful political conduct\" with the charity's money and using it for personal matters. The foundation was dissolved and Trump was forced to pay $2 million as part of a settlement in 2019 . Nov. 4, 2021 Vance convenes a new grand jury for six months to hear evidence against Trump, paving the way for it to last until after he leaves office in January. The grand jury that was already convened was set to expire. It had voted to bring charges against the Trump Organization and its CFO, Weisselberg , on unrelated matters. Jan. 1, 2022 Bragg takes office as Manhattan's new district attorney. Before leaving office, Vance does not bring charges against Trump. Feb. 22, 2022 The two prosecutors leading the Trump probe -- Assistant District Attorneys Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz -- resign from the district attorney's office. Pomerantz later reveals that he disagreed with Bragg's decision to not bring charges against Trump in Bragg's early days as DA. Pomerantz was formerly a special prosecutor with the Southern District of New York. The investigation continues after their resignations but doubt is cast on whether charges will be brought against Trump. Aug. 18, 2022 Weisselberg pleads guilty to tax evasion , admitting he avoided taxes on nearly $2 million in income in a yearslong scheme. He agrees to a plea bargain for five months in prison and to testify against the Trump Organization at the upcoming trial in October. But, the plea agreement does not require him to testify against Trump himself. Dec. 5, 2022 Bragg announces he has hired Matthew Colangelo as senior counsel. He was a previous Department of Justice official and prior to that worked at the New York Attorney General's Office where he was part of the team that investigated the Trump Foundation. Dec. 6, 2022 A jury finds the Trump Organization guilty on all counts of tax fraud brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Charges included scheme to defraud, conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. Beginning of 2023 A grand jury has been hearing testimony about the hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, sources tell ABC News, including testimony from Pecker , the longtime Trump confidant. The DA's office also has the cooperation of Cohen. Jan. 18, 2023 In a letter to book publisher Simon & Schuster, Bragg says he is concerned an upcoming book about Trump written by Pomerantz could harm the district attorney's office's investigation. Bragg asks the publisher to delay its release by asking for 60 days to review its manuscript. Pomerantz's publisher says the book will be published in February as planned. Jan. 30, 2023 Pecker becomes one of the first people to testify in front of the reconvened grand jury as it investigates hush money payments to Daniels. Feb. 7, 2023 Simon & Schuster releases Pomerantz's book, \"People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account,\" in which he criticizes Bragg, saying Bragg made a mistake by not bringing a case against Trump at the beginning of his tenure. Pomerantz had been assigned to the case by Vance. Bragg responds to the criticism , saying the case against Trump wasn't ready. Feb. 8, 2023 Cohen meets with prosecutors investigating Trump in what is his 15th time meeting with the district attorney's office, but his first since the grand jury was convened. March 13, 2023 Cohen again testifies before the grand jury investigating the hush money payments. March 20, 2023 Bob Costello, an attorney who says he previously advised Cohen, tells reporters his former client has a \"lie, cheat, steal\" mindset after Costello testifies for the defense before the Manhattan grand jury investigating Trump's role in the hush payment to Daniels.

Michael Cohen is not solid evidence.\" March 27, 2023 Pecker speaks to the grand jury again for about an hour, according to sources familiar with the matter. The district attorney's office may have called Pecker to bolster Cohen's earlier testimony about the purpose of the payment. March 30, 2023 The Manhattan grand jury hands down an indictment against Trump, making him the first former or current president to be indicted. The indictment remains under seal so it's not immediately clear what Trump will be charged with, but he negotiates his surrender, saying he will travel to New York the following week. April 3, 2023 Trump travels to New York City from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida home, one day ahead of surrendering to the court. He spends the night at his apartment in Trump Tower. April 4, 2023 Trump travels to the Manhattan courthouse from midtown Manhattan to be processed by authorities before heading to court for his arraignment and the unsealing of the indictment. Former President Donald Trump appears in court with his legal team for an arraignment on charges stemming from his indictment by a Manhattan grand jury following a probe into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, in New York City, April 4, 2023. Andrew Kelly/Pool via Reuters The former president pleads not guilty to 34 felony charges of falsifying business records stemming from his hush payment to Daniels. Prosecutors allege that he engaged in a \"scheme\" to boost his election chances during the 2016 presidential race through a series of hush money payments made by others to help his campaign, and then \"repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records\" to conceal that criminal conduct. Former President Donald Trump arrives to speak during a press conference following his court appearance over an alleged 'hush-money' payment, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., on April 4, 2023. Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images Trump immediately returns to Mar-a-Lago where he gives a speech to supporters the same night criticizing Bragg for bringing charges and adding, \"We are a nation in decline, and now these radical left lunatics want to interfere in elections by using law enforcement. We can't let that happen.\" April 12, 2023 A threatening letter containing white powder is sent to Bragg, the second since Trump started posting on social media about his impending indictment. There are no reports of injuries or illness. Bragg himself has received \"multiple\" death threats since Trump's indictment, police sources tell ABC News. April 17, 2023 Prosecutors say the judge overseeing the criminal case against Trump should ask one of his attorneys for additional information about a potential conflict of interest. Trump\u2019s defense team includes Joe Tacopina, an attorney Daniels once considered hiring to represent her, and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office says Tacopina\u2019s representations so far are insufficient. Trump affirmed at his arraignment he wanted to move forward with Tacopina on his legal team, but Susan Hoffinger, the executive assistant district attorney, said a full hearing would be needed. The potential conflict was raised by Daniels\u2019 current attorney, Clark Brewster, who said in a letter to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office Daniels had a 2018 conversation with Tacopina and lawyers at his firm. Tacopina has said he never spoke to Daniels and he told the judge his firm refused to represent her. May 8, 2023 Judge Juan Merchan, the New York City judge overseeing Trump's criminal case, imposes a protective order against Trump that is meant to ensure evidence shared by the DA's office doesn't wind up on the internet. Prosecutors had sought the protective order because of what they called Trump's \"extensive history\" of making inflammatory remarks about witnesses, prosecutors and others associated with legal matters pending against him, assistant district attorney Catherine McCaw said when seeking the order. May 24, 2023 Judge Merchan sets a trial date of March 25, 2024, for Trump's criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records. He had previously indicated that no one associated with the case is allowed to schedule anything that would conflict with the trial. The judge also reviews for Trump the terms of the protective order that prohibits him from sharing on social media any evidence turned over by the Manhattan district attorney during discovery. June 2, 2023 Attorneys for Trump ask Judge Merchan to step aside , citing the judge's daughter's ties to a Democratic organization. The defense says the judge can't be impartial because his daughter is an executive at Authentic Campaigns, a Democratic consulting firm that worked on President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. Merchan himself will decide whether he is impartial. June 16, 2023 Trump tries in a new court filing to get his criminal prosecution in New York moved to federal court , arguing the alleged crimes \"took place while the president was in office.\" Trump's attorneys accuse the Manhattan district attorney's office of \"deceptively mischaracterizing and ignoring the applicable facts and body of law\" by seeking to keep the case in state court. June 27, 2023 A federal judge seems disinclined allow Trump to move his criminal prosecution in New York into federal court. \"The act for which the president has been indicted does not relate to anything under the color of his office,\" says Judge Alvin Hellerstein, adding that he intends to issue a decision in the coming weeks. July 19, 2023 Federal judge Alvin Hellerstein rejects Trump's request to move his hush-money criminal case into federal court. \"Trump has failed to show that the conduct charged by the Indictment is for or relating to any act performed by or for the President under color of the official acts of a President,\" Hellerstein writes in his ruling. August 28, 2023 The judge overseeing Trump's federal election interference case orders the trial in that case to begin on March 4, 2024, after speaking with Bragg to advise him of the likely overlap between the two cases, both of which are slated to start that month. Sept. 12, 2023 Judge Merchan signals he is open to moving the date of the trial, currently scheduled for March 4, due to \"the many recent developments involving Mr. Trump.\" Sept. 18, 2023 Judge Merchan rules that attorney Joe Tacopina has no conflict representing Trump in the case despite prior dealings with Stormy Daniels. Tacopina had been contacted about representing Daniels prior to her choosing since-disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti. Oct. 5, 2023 Trump asks a New York judge to dismiss all charges in his hush money case. \"President Trump cannot be said to have falsified business records of the Trump Organization by paying his personal attorney using his personal bank accounts,\" defense attorney Todd Blanche says in the motion, which calls the case a \"discombobulated package of politically motivated charges.\" Nov. 14, 2023 Trump drops his effort to move his criminal hush money prosecution from Manhattan court into federal court. Nov. 16, 2023 Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, in a court filing , opposes Trump's attempt to dismiss his criminal indictment, saying the former president is seeking \"special treatment\" that he does not deserve. Jan. 15, 2024 Stormy Daniels is \"set to testify\" in Trump's Manhattan hush money trial set for March 25, the adult film actress says on the most recent episode of her podcast. Feb. 15, 2024 In the case's final hearing before the trial gets underway, Judge Juan Merchan -- with Trump in attendance -- denies Trump's motion to dismiss the case and shoots down arguments from the defense that the trial should be delayed because it will interfere with Trump's campaigning for president. Feb. 26, 2024 DA Alvin Bragg asks a judge to impose a limited gag order barring Trump from making public statements about witnesses, jurors, court staff and prosecutors other than Bragg involved in the case, citing what he calls Trump's \"longstanding and perhaps singular history\" of attacking people he considers to be adversaries. Feb. 29, 2024 Prosecutors plan to use Trump's own words -- including quotes from books like \"Trump: The Art of the Deal\" -- against him in his hush money trial, according to court filings. March 4, 2024 Trump's defense lawyers ask Judge Juan Merchan to deny prosecutors' request for a limited gag order, arguing the former president should be permitted to fully respond to attacks by his political opponents. March 5, 2024 The public release of the infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape before the 2016 presidential election \"served as the catalyst\" for Trump's hush payment to Stormy Daniels and should be admissible at his upcoming trial, prosecutors argue in a court filing. March 6, 2024 Trump's attorneys, in a filing, accuse Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of pursuing a \"deluded fantasy\" case against the former president by tying a hush payment to an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. March 7, 2024 Judge Merchan agrees with the DA's request to limit the disclosure of the names and other identifying information of jurors in the upcoming trial, finding \"there is a likelihood of bribery, jury tampering, or of physical injury or harassment of juror(s).\" March 11, 2024 Attorneys for Trump ask Judge Merchan to delay the start of the trial while the U.S. Supreme Court weighs Trump's presidential immunity argument -- but the judge pushes back, criticizing the timing of the request and ordering Trump's team to seek permission before making future motions. March 12, 2024 Attorneys for Trump say in a court filing that they will not invoke a formal \"advice of counsel\" defense at the trial, but signal that Trump will argue he did not intend to break the law \"because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved.\" March 14, 2024 The Manhattan district attorney's office tells Judge Merchan that it would accept a 30-day delay to the start of the hush money trial, citing newly disclosed evidence from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. March 18, 2024 Judge Merchan denies Trump\u2019s attempts to exclude evidence related to the Access Hollywood tape and testimony from key witnesses from his upcoming criminal trial, but rules that prosecutors will not be permitted to play the infamous tape to jurors. March 21, 2024 Trump's request for a lengthy adjournment of his hush money trial based on recently disclosed potential evidence is \"a red herring\" and part of a \"strategic delay,\" prosecutors argue in a court filing. Stormy Daniels, meanwhile, tells ABC's \"The View\" that she is \"absolutely ready\" to testify at trial. March 25, 2024 Judge Juan Merchan orders the trial to begin with jury selection on April 15. The decision rejects a bid by Trump's attorneys to further delay the case after the defense raised issues with the late production of over 100,000 pages of potential evidence by federal prosecutors. March 26, 2024 Judge Merchan grants the Manhattan district attorney's request for a limited gag order on the former president that prevents Trump from making public statements about witnesses in the hush money case, prospective jurors, members of the court staff and their families other than the judge, and lawyers in the case other than Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. The partial gag order follows Trump's disparaging remarks about witness Michael Cohen, Judge Merchan, and Merchan's daughter, who works with a group involved in Democratic politics. April 1, 2024 Judge Merchan expands his limited gag order on Trump to cover the family members of the judge and District Attorney Alvin Bragg, following a request by prosecutors after Trump continues to target Merchan's daughter on social media. The development comes as sources tell ABC News that Trump's former spokesperson Hope Hicks is expected to testify for the prosecution at the upcoming trial. April 2, 2024 Trump's lawyers again ask Judge Merchan to recuse himself from the trial , seven months after the judge declined a similar request by defense lawyers. April 3, 2024 Judge Merchan rules that Trump is not immune from prosecution in the case on the grounds of presidential immunity, in part because Trump failed to invoke the defense in a timely fashion. The ruling comes on the same day the Manhattan DA's office urges the judge to reject Trump's attempt to delay the upcoming trial due to the large amount of pretrial publicity. April 5, 2024 Judge Merchan quashes a subpoena issued to NBCUniversal by defense lawyers that had sought materials related to their documentary about Stormy Daniels, calling the request the \"very definition of a fishing expedition.\" April 8, 2024 Judge Lizbeth Gonzalez of Appellate Division First Department denies Trump's attempt to delay the upcoming trial on the grounds that pretrial publicity has made it impossible to find a fair and impartial jury. The development comes on the same day that Judge Merchan releases the questionnaire he plans to use to oversee jury selection for the trial. ABC News, meanwhile, reports that prosecutors at the upcoming trial are expected to call several witnesses who are or were part of Trump's inner circle . April 9, 2024 Appellate Judge Cynthia Kern declines Trump's request to delay the upcoming trial while waiting for the full panel of the Appellate Division First Department to weigh, later this month, whether to relax Trump's limited gag order. April 10, 2024 Appellate Judge Ellen Gesmer declines Trump's request to delay the upcoming trial while waiting for the full panel of the Appellate Division First Department to weigh, later this month, Trump's challenge to a ruling by Judge Merchan barring the defense from raising objections to evidence based on presidential immunity, as well as the judge's refusal to recuse himself from the case. Trump's attorneys, in the meantime, have subpoenaed the wrong Jeremy Rosenberg , according to court filings. April 12, 2024 Three days before the scheduled start of the trial, Judge Merchan denies Trump's request to adjourn the case due to overwhelming pretrial publicity. April 15, 2024 The first criminal trial involving a former U.S. president gets underway in New York with the start of Donald Trump's hush money trial. The former president sits through roughly six hours of court proceedings as the process of seating a 12-person jury begins.

Jabin Botsford-Pool/Getty Images April 16, 2024 On Day 2 of the trial , the first seven jurors are selected for the 12-person jury that will be supplemented with six alternates. Among the seven are an oncology nurse, an attorney, a teacher and an IT consultant. April 17, 2024 The remaining five jurors -- five men and seven women --- are selected for the 12-person jury on Day 3 of the trial , after a temporary setback results in the dismissal of two jurors who were previously seated. April 19, 2024 A full jury of 12 jurors and six alternates is seated in Day 4 of the trial . The alternate jurors are five women and one man. April 22, 2024 Attorneys deliver opening statements in Day 5 of the trial , with prosecutors framing the case as \"election fraud, pure and simple\" and the defense seeking to distance Trump from any alleged wrongdoing.",

            "date": "2024-04-20 19:03:00",
            "content": "Former President Donald Trump had intended to seize his first free Saturday since his first criminal trial began , in New York City, with a large rally in a crucial swing state as well as a fundraiser to shore up his support among the kinds of conservative backers who can help him eat into rival Joe Biden's cash advantage . But those plans were derailed, in part, by a severe weather system rolling over the Southeast -- including North Carolina, where many Trump supporters had already gathered at the Aero Center Wilmington by the time the event was called off amid a severe thunderstorm warning. \"We want to keep everybody safe. That's the most important thing,\" Trump was heard saying in a live phone call blasted out to the crowd gathered at the rally in Wilmington, adding that they will \"just do a rain check.\" The event would have been Trump's first campaign rally since the New York criminal trial started early in the week. He has denied all wrongdoing in the case but is confined to the courtroom most weekdays, except Wednesday, for a proceeding that is expected to take up to two months. The rally's postponement was unexpected but marked something of a setback for Trump in the early phase of his general election fight against President Biden. Trump only narrowly won North Carolina over Biden in 2020; holding it will likely be key to his chances in November. But the trial in New York -- the first of four that Trump faces -- has complicated his campaign schedule, and while he has made some efforts to maximize his time in the city outside of court, including a stop last week at a Harlem bodega after a day of jury selection, he has made notably fewer appearances before voters than Biden in recent weeks. The Biden campaign contends that Trump has been lagging their swing state efforts even before the trial began. MORE: Melania Trump makes rare appearance on 2024 campaign trail Separately on Saturday, Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, held dueling fundraisers in different states, with the former president raising money for his campaign and the Republican Party in North Carolina in the afternoon -- ahead of the canceled rally -- and the former first lady raising money for a conservative LGBTQ+ group at their Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in the evening. Especially for Melania Trump, it was a rare appearance at a fundraising event as she has mostly stayed away from the former president's campaign trail this election cycle and instead only occasionally been seen at private events at his properties. The last two times she was seen publicly were at a major Palm Beach fundraiser for the Trump campaign and Republicans earlier this month, where they said they raised more than $50 million -- and last month at a Palm Beach polling location, where the former president voted in the Florida Republican primary. She headlined the fundraiser for Log Cabin Republicans, the largest 501(c)4 nonprofit organization representing LGBT conservatives in the United States. The fundraiser was co-hosted by a slew of longtime Donald Trump allies and prominent Republican donors, including a former U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who also served as acting director of national intelligence in the Trump administration. He was the first openly gay person to hold a Cabinet-level position in the United States. Former President Donald Trump and former first lady Melania Trump walk together as they prepare to vote at a polling station setup in the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center, on March 19, 2024, in Palm Beach, Fla. Joe Raedle/Getty Images, FILE A former president of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum and an active fundraiser of the former president, Bill White, and White's husband, Bryan Eure, were also among the co-hosts. Other notable guests and co-hosts included former Trump-endorsed Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz, who lost to Democratic Sen.

Ahead of the event Saturday morning, Grenell posted on X that Melania Trump \"will launch the most aggressive campaign we've ever seen from Republicans to win support from gay and lesbian Americans.\" \"We have largely achieved equality in America for gays,\" Grenell wrote, praising the United States as the champion of freedom and liberties and throwing support for Donald Trump. \"He is the best candidate for our safety, security and prosperity,\" he continued. \"He sees you as 100% equal - it's up to you to be responsible, hardworking and successful. Anyone telling you that you are oppressed in America or that you need special side agreements because you're gay is only seeking to control you. Break out from their condescending cult-like manipulations.\" \"You can be anything you want to be in America,\" Grenell wrote, claiming Trump will win a significant amount of the gay vote in 2024. While the former president differentiated himself from some other leading conservatives in embracing gay people, his anti-trans positions have drawn broader outcry from the LGBTQ+ community. An organizer of the fundraiser told ABC News that the event sold out within 36 hours and has already raised more than $1 million, with additional people donating even if they couldn't attend the event. Roughly 70 people from all across the country -- California, New York, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Washington, D.C. -- were expected to attend the event, the organizer said ahead of time. \"For the first lady to choose this as her first campaign event is an honor to the conservative Republican gay community,\" the organizer, who asked not to be quoted by name to be more candid, told ABC News. \"Definitely negates the false narrative that Biden and the Democrats have peddled about the Trump administration.\" \"Trump has grown the Republican base of all types of minorities unlike any other Republican has,\" the organizer continued. \"The Log Cabin has a clear plan of how this money will be spent to educate voters about President Trump's record and to help him win with the gay community in swing states.\" Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump and former first lady Melania Trump arrive at the home of John and Jenny Paulson, on April 6, 2024, in Palm Beach, Fla. Alon Skuy/Getty Images Eure, a senior vice president at insurance brokerage firm Willis Towers Watson, expressed gratitude toward the former first lady and maintained that many gay voters are concerned about their future after three years under the Biden administration. \"Gay voters are no longer one-issue voters,\" Eure said, noting he and his husband have been legally married for almost 13 years. Adding that the 2024 election is a battle for a second term for both Biden and Trump, he said, \"We know what we are getting with both of these candidates -- the only question to ask is were you better off with Trump or Biden? We believe President Trump is the only choice for us.\" Melania Trump has maintained a close relationship with Log Cabin Republicans over the years, headlining their annual gala at Mar-a-Lago in 2021 and receiving the group's Spirit of Lincoln award, for her role in \"helping children reach their full potential\" and \"championing a more inclusive Republican Party.\" In 2022, Donald Trump himself headlined Log Cabin Republicans' Spirit of Lincoln gala held at Mar-a-Lago, where he told the audience, \"we are fighting for the gay community, and we are fighting and fighting hard.\" Meanwhile in Charlotte, North Carolina, Saturday afternoon, Trump fundraised with Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who was previously the North Carolina Republican Party's chairman, as well as Trump's daughter-in-law and new RNC Co-chair Lara Trump. MORE: Trump's Palm Beach fundraiser, joined by Melania Trump, rakes in $50 million, organizers say Ticketed from $5,000 per couple for general admission to $250,000 per couple to be on the host-committee, the fundraiser was expected to raise at least $5 million, according to the event's invitation and the organizer. A photo opportunity with the former president is priced at $25,000 per couple and a roundtable would cost $100,000 per couple. Money raised from this fundraiser would be split among the Trump campaign, Trump's Save America PAC, which has footed much of Trump's legal bills, the RNC and 40 other state GOP committees. Notable co-hosts of the fundraiser included North Carolina's National Committeeman Ed Broyhill, who was previously Trump's North Carolina Finance Committee chair in 2016, and Army veteran Scott Greenblatt, who runs a veterans claims consulting company.

So if you don't mind, we're going to have to just do a rain check,\" Trump told the crowd. \"I'm so sad -- I'm in North Carolina right now and waiting to go in, but they say the weather is really getting bad. Really really getting bad. So we have to rely on the weather service.\" The North Carolina fundraiser comes on the heels of Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper saying President Joe Biden can win the state despite Trump carrying the state both in 2016 and 2020. Both Biden and Harris campaigned in North Carolina last month, highlighting their health care messaging. Broyhill, one of the co-hosts of the Trump fundraiser, however, told ABC News that North Carolina is a GOP stronghold, claiming Republicans success in down ballot seats. \"I don't know what people talk about when they say this is a purple state,\" Broyhill said. \"There is no chance in hell that Joe Biden is going to come close to winning North Carolina.\" \"There are quite a large number of top donors that are flying in, and once they arrive, their expectations will far surpass 5 million,\" Broyhill said of the upcoming fundraiser.",

HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): A bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans has risen up. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: The House has worked its will. These are not normal times here in the House or around the world. KARL: A big win for the speaker of the House, one that may cost him his job. THOMAS MASSIE: Mike Johnson's a lame duck. He is not going to lead us into the next Congress. KARL: This morning, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul and Congressman Ro Khanna join us. Plus, our powerhouse roundtable.

KARL: As Earth Week kicks off, MaryAlice Parks speaks with the environmental advocates fighting climate change at the ballot box. Part of our ABC News special series \"The Power of Us.\" (END VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, it\u2019s THIS WEEK. Here now, Jonathan Karl. KARL: Good morning. Welcome to THIS WEEK. This weekend we saw a rare outbreak of bipartisanship in what had seemed to be a hopelessly dysfunctional Congress. Just maybe the dawn of a new day for the House of Representatives, or it might have been a final act of yet another Republican speaker destined to be brought down by hardliners in his own party. Here's what we know. After months of delay, the House overwhelmingly approved billions of dollars in funding for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. The vote on Ukraine funding was lopsided, a resounding show of support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s efforts to defend his nation from Russia\u2019s aggression. But look more closely at the vote. Look at how Republicans voted. Just 101 Republicans voted yes, 112 voted no. That's a majority of House Republicans voting against support for Ukraine, a defining moment for the Republican Party and a screaming indicator that the party of Reagan, and the hawks who followed him, is a distant memory. This is Trump's party, not Reagan\u2019s. It's a party that has fully embraced Trump's vision of America first. And while that is Trump's slogan, it was also the slogan of the isolationist Republicans who nearly a century ago opposed America\u2019s support for Great Britain in the beginning of World War II. Yesterday's vote was also a defining moment for Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. He did his job. He allowed the House to work its will. But he had to stand up to many in his own party to do so. Minutes after the vote, President Zelenskyy took note of the man who made it possible, posting on X, quote, \u201cI am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track.\u201d Speaker Johnson had to rely on Democrats to make it happen. And as he now faces a challenge to his leadership, Mike Johnson will almost certainly need to rely on Democrats to survive as speaker. A fact that could radically change the power dynamics in Congress. So we begin this morning with ABC\u2019s Selina Wang on Capitol Hill. Good morning, Selina. SELINA WANG, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Jon. This is a defining moment for Speaker Johnson. After months of delay, the House has finally passed $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. But Johnson, he took enormous risk to get this done, defying the far-right wing of his party. But his job is safe, at least for now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): I think we did our work here, and I think history will judge it well. WANG (voice over): For weeks Marjorie Taylor Greene threatened to force a vote to remove Mike Johnson as speaker of the House if he dared to allow a vote on military aid for Ukraine. But now that the vote has happened, Greene still has not pulled the trigger, at least not yet. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): I'm actually going to let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents. WANG (voice over): Now she'll have to wait until the House is back in session at the end of the month. GREENE: There is more support that's growing. I've said from the beginning, I'm going to be responsible with this. I support my majority. I support the majority next time. I do not support Mike Johnson. WANG (voice over): So far only two other House Republicans have signaled they backed Greene's potential motion to vacate Johnson as speaker. But with the razor-thin Republican majority, that could be enough to oust the speaker. But Johnson says he doesn't care because support for Ukraine is more important than his job. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys. My son is going to begin in the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game. It\u2019s not a joke. We can't play politics with this. We have to do the right thing. WANG (voice over): Johnson\u2019s support for Ukraine has won him some unlikely allies, Democrats who could help him save his job. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Traditional conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You think you can trust the speaker? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Well, so far it looks that way. WANG (voice over): Republican hardliners are outraged by Johnson\u2019s turnaround. For months he had said any aid to Ukraine should be tied to funding for U.S. border security, despite recently rejecting a bipartisan border deal that former President Trump opposed. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): We're worried about America's border. He seems to be more worried about Ukraine. WANG (voice over): And Republican hardliners are even angrier that Johnson reached out to Democrats to get this done. REP. THOMAS MASSIE (R-KY): I'm concerned that the speaker's cut a deal with the Democrats to fund foreign wars. REP. ELI CRANE (R-AZ): I'm very disappointed. And I've told Speaker Johnson that personally. I've continued to see capitulation and an unwillingness to even fight. WANG (voice over): Johnson says he\u2019s not worried about the threats. JOHNSON: I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate. I have to do my job. WANG: Johnson may need Democrats to keep his job. And so far at least some say they will. REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): I will vote to keep Johnson as speaker. REP. DAN GOLDMAN (D-NY): I think that there will be Democrats who are happy to support him if he wants it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WANG (on camera): In addition to aid to Ukraine, the House also passed $26 billion in aid to Israel. In the end, 37 Democrats voted against that. So now this package of bills, it heads over to the Senate, where they're expected to vote on this on Tuesday. And for his part, President Biden, he thanked the House for getting this done, saying that this sends a powerful message to the world about American leadership. Jon. KARL: Thank you, Selina. I'm joined now by the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Michael McCaul. So, let me ask you, Congressman, at the end, the vote was overwhelming, particularly on Ukraine. REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIR & (R) TEXAS: Right. KARL: On all of these bills. Why did it have to be so difficult? Why would \u2013 why did it take months to happen? MCCAUL: Well, I think, you know, the motion to vacate McCarthy, which is a rarely used tool \u2013 only twice in the history of Congress, right, and the threat of the motion to vacate kept this from coming to the floor in a timely basis. I have to say, watching your piece, I am so proud of the speaker, Mike Johnson. He went through a transformation. At the end of the day, a profile in courage is putting the nation above yourself. And that's when he did. He said at the end of the day I'm going to \u2013 I'm going to be on the right side of history irrespective of my job. And I think that was what I admired so much. KARL: It was a transformation. I mean he \u2013 he had initially said, no Ukraine funding until we take care of the border. He was with a lot of \u2013 you know, what \u2013 basically what the radicals are saying. What \u2013 how do you explain that transformation? What made Johnson become the steadfast guy on this? The \u2013 as you said, the profile in courage? MCCAUL: I think he tried to do what the, you know, say the Freedom Caucus wanted him to do. It wasn't going to work in the Senate or the White House. At the end of the day, we were running out of time. Ukraine's getting ready to fall. And I think the \u2013 I think the briefings that he got in the classified space, the advice he got from people like me and Mike Turner, House Intelligence, Armed Services, I think talking to world leaders, he became the man that went from a district in Louisiana to the speaker of the United States, to also someone who had to look at the entire world and had to carry the burden of that and make the right decision. And his son's going to Annapolis. He is smart. He knows what's at stake here if we surrender in Ukraine, like we did in Afghanistan. America will be weaker, not stronger. KARL: It's fascinating, he really was the one guy that could either make it happen or not happen. Is his job now in jeopardy? MCCAUL: I tell you what, he's got my support. And he has a lot of \u2013 I think he \u2013 his \u2013 the stock in Mike Johnson\u2019s gone way up. I think the respect for him\u2019s gone way up because he did the right thing irrespective of his job. That garnered a lot of respect. And also from the Democrat side. Now, that\u2019s not what you normally want. But I do think that \u2013 KARL: What's not what you normally want? MCCAUL: Well \u2013 KARL: To rely on Democrats? MCCAUL: To have to do that, right? KARL: Yes. MCCAUL: It shows you that we're in a bipartisan era to some strange \u2013 in some strange way where Democrats will be able to back the speaker on the other side of the aisle and not have him vacated out of the chair. But I think that \u2013 I think \u2013 I think he's in good shape. I really do. KARL: I mean, you already have enough Republicans to force it -- it only takes one to force the vote and you already have enough to remove him if it were only Republicans. So it looks like he's going to need to rely on Democrats to remain speaker of the House. How does that change the dynamic? I mean -- MCCAUL: Well, I think there are also -- KARL: We now have a coalition government in the -- in the House effectively? MCCAUL: Well, I don\u2019t know, maybe some people like that. I mean, there are -- KARL: Yeah. MCCAUL: I mean, there are -- there are those in my party -- look, the motion to vacate has only been used in history. Once Joe Cannon used it against himself to keep his position, and then McCarthy. When the motion gets threatened every week in the Congress, that is being abused. And I think we need to fix that. That is a tool that's being abused by a minority when the majority of my conference don't agree with them. And they use that because they think that gives them power, and it does if they have a gun to the speaker's head every day. And so, I think that's something that we\u2019ll -- we'll be looking at. KARL: I mean, when you look -- when you heard the way Johnson was talking about this moment in history, whether or not we support Ukraine, the warning that if we don't, if Putin succeeds there, he moves through Europe, potentially. It\u2019s certainly what -- particularly the Eastern Europeans worry about. You've made that case. Why is it that a majority of Republicans in the House voted against supporting Ukraine? MCCAUL: I think they bought into this notion that it's an either/or proposition. You can't secure the border -- you can't support Ukraine without the border. We can do both. We're a great nation. Now we are stuck in a political issue here. But, you know, America's back, and we have our allies back now. And the people, you know, in Israel, and in Ukraine, and in Taiwan, and our NATO allies now know that America's back. That we're leading the free world like Ronald Reagan did -- and, you know, Reagan brought down the Soviet Union for God's sakes. The eyes of the world are watching and our adversaries are watching, and history is watching. And that's what I kept telling my colleagues, do you want to be a Chamberlain or a Churchill? Because that is the moment in time that we are at. KARL: Well, one of your colleagues who agrees with you on this, Dan Crenshaw, said that looking at his colleagues that don't support this, fellow Republicans, it's -- I\u2019m guessing the reasoning is they want Russia to win so badly they're willing to oust the speaker over it. I mean, how is it that we have Republic -- the party of Reagan, or formerly the party of Reagan, acting as if they want Russia to succeed in Ukraine? MCCAUL: I grew up in the Cold War, and I see -- I see the whole thing differently. I think if we -- if we -- if we surrender on Ukraine like we did in Afghanistan, which was a debacle, is the United States of America going to be stronger or weaker? I would say weaker, and then Putin will invade Moldova. That\u2019s not Article 5. Georgia, he'll threaten the Baltics. And the United States has already -- we can't shrink from this responsibility. You know, I quoted Chamber -- Churchill yesterday, the gathering storm. He talked about how it was unnecessary war. He saw the axis of evil and Hitler coming to power, but then he says, also, this is an unnecessary war that could have been stopped. My dad was in that war. Just think if we could have stopped Hitler at Poland, how much blood and treasure we could have prevented. I think we're at the same moment in history now. KARL: So where's Trump on this? I mean, we saw it when we met with Viktor Orban in Turkey, Orban came out and said, not a penny more for Ukraine. Where's -- where\u2019s the leader (ph) of your party on this? MCCAUL: If you read through the tea leaves, he has not come out and condemned a vote for Ukraine. What he said -- KARL: Not yet, yeah. MCCAUL: -- what he said, it wouldn\u2019t happen if I\u2019d been president. He likes the idea of the loan program. You're going to hear Lindsey Graham talk today on Sunday. We\u2019ve been talking to him about this loan program, and Mike Johnson has, too. He likes the idea that it's not just a giveaway, but a loan program like the EU has for Ukraine. And so, I think what he wants is for a lifeline to be given to Ukraine so that when he gets into office, in his thinking, that he can then negotiate and save it. KARL: Well, it's a loan program that can be forgiven. Congressman McCaul, Chairman McCaul, thank you very much for joining us. MCCAUL: Thanks, Jon. Thanks for having me. KARL: Appreciate it. Coming up, we'll ask Congressman Ro Khanna how Democrats are responding to Speaker Johnson's moves and whether they'll help him stay in power. We're back in just two minutes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KARL: After a busy and dramatic day on Capitol Hill, I'm joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of California. Congressman Khanna, does Speaker Johnson deserve credit for how this played out? REP. RO KHANNA, (D) ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE & (D) CALIFORNIA: He does. Look, we came into Congress together and he always cared about civility. He actually led the civility pledge. KARL: That's right. Yes. KHANNA: And he \u2013 we had one issue, which was give individual votes. Don't lump things together. And I give him credit for doing this. I would actually vote to table any motion to vacate him. You know, Congressman McCaul quoted Churchill. One of the things Churchill said is that America always exhausted every wrong option until doing the right thing. KARL: Yes. KHANNA: And this shows that American democracy still is very strong. KARL: OK, you just said something significant. You said you would oppose the tabled \u2013 the motion to vacate. In other words, you will protect Speaker Johnson's job if Marjorie Taylor Greene and the others go through with their threat to try to remove him? KHANNA: I would, though the end of the term. I expect Speaker Pelosi -- Speaker Jeffries will be there in 2025. KARL: Right \u2013 not \u2013 speaker, yes. Yes. KHANNA: But look, I'm a progressive Democrat and I think you would have a few progressive Democrats doing that. And I disagree with Speaker Johnson on many issues and have been very critical of him. But he did the right thing here and he deserves to keep his job until the end of his term. KARL: Now, would you and fellow Democrats that will protect him at this moment ask him anything in return? I mean do we effectively have \u2013 you heard me ask Congressman McCaul, a coalition government in the House? KHANNA: I'll leave the negotiations to Speaker Jeffries. KARL: Yes. KHANNA: But I don't think everything in politics needs to be transactional. I think here you have Speaker Johnson, who not only put this up for a vote, but he also separated the bills, which I thought was courageous. He let people vote their conscience on Taiwan, on the offensive aid to Israel, on \u2013 on Ukraine. And I give him credit for that. KARL: Now, you were one of the 37 who voted against the funding for Israel. Tell me \u2013 tell me more. Tell me why. I mean I \u2013 you know, why? And was that a high number or a low number in your \u2013 in your view? KHANNA: It was a high number. It was a hard vote. I mean, look, it \u2013 this was a stance against a blank check for Netanyahu and offensive weapons unconditionally while he's talking about going into Rafah with \u2013 when we know more women and children are going to die. And the reason that you had people like Jamie Raskin, Lloyd Doggett, myself, who have voted for Israel aid year after year and voted for Iron Dome, take this stand, is that we wanted to make it clear that there has to be a change in strategy and no more famine and suffering in Gaza. KARL: I'm sure you saw the report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" on Friday that the administration \u2013 the Biden administration is considering a billion-dollar arms deal with Israel. Are you concerned about how Biden is handling this? KHANNA: I am in terms of, I\u2019m glad that he's moving in the rhetoric. But we can't be shipping offensive weapon when Netanyahu, on his own terms, is defying the president's State Department, defying the president's secretary of defense. And we know that thousands of people are going to die. And, by the way, Jon, we know that Israel is still using the 2022 authorization and appropriation for Iron Dome, which I voted for, and many of the 37 who voted no voted for that funding. The money yesterday is not going to be used for another two and a half years. So why are we giving this unconditionally to Netanyahu when the entire world is saying that there's famine there, that we need a new strategy, that we need release of the hostages and peace? KARL: So have you -- have you given this message to the White House? KHANNA: They know. (LAUGHTER) KHANNA: They -- they've heard from many -- many of us. But it's not just progressive Democrats. I mean -- and we need an architecture for peace in -- in the Middle East. I mean, look, Iran's attacks were totally unjustified. We -- I voted to condemn them. But the reality is, until we have a security cooperation effort, a diplomatic architecture in the Middle East, with Iran, with Saudi Arabia, with Israel, you're never going to get peace. And we're not going to be able to do what Lindsey Graham wants, which is blow Iran off the map. So what is the alternative? How are we going to get diplomacy and peace? That's where President Biden should be leading, as President Obama did. KARL: I mean, given the Iran attack, attempted attack on Israel, I mean, it was for the most part unsuccessful. But, I mean, how do you -- how do you not support Israel in terms of defense aid at a time when the Iranians, you know, have done something they have never done before, which is try to directly attack the -- the Israelis... KHANNA: You know, I... KARL: ... directly from Iran to Israel? KHANNA: You absolutely do, and I supported Iron Dome funding. I would have voted for a -- we tried -- Dan Kildee introduced an amendment saying let's just make this about Iron Dome and David's Sling and Arrow 3. That amendment wasn't ruled in order. Many of us have voted for all the defensive aid. I'd still support it, and I'd support the United States using the Interceptors to knock anything down against Iran. But what we need is to figure out how we de-escalate, not give them offensive weapons now going to Hezbollah to expand the war. And by the way, Jon, look, I'm for the Labor tradition, from Ben-Gurion to Golda Meir to Rabin to Peres to Barak. I'm not for Begin to Sharon to Netanyahu. And what you've done is given a far-right Israeli government a carte blanche right now. KARL: And before you go, there was also the vote on TikTok that was part of this. I know you have opposed efforts to force the sale of TikTok with the threat of a ban. But now it looks like, if TikTok is not sold within a year, this bill becomes law that ByteDance has to either, you know, if it doesn't sell, it's banned in the United States? KHANNA: I don't think it's going to pass First Amendment scrutiny because I think there are less restrictive alternatives. We could have made it a crime to transfer Americans' data to an adversarial foreign nation or foreign state interference. But to just ban 170 million Americans who are engaged in speech and livelihood, the federal judge in Montana struck it down. The judges struck it down when Trump tried this. I doubt it survives scrutiny in the Supreme Court. KARL: All right. Congressman Ro Khanna, thank you for joining us here on \"This Week.\" KHANNA: Thank you, Jon. KARL: The powerhouse roundtable is standing by, ready to break down what happens next for Speaker Johnson and how Donald Trump's first criminal trial could impact the 2024 race. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Under my predecessor, who's busy right now, Pennsylvania lost 275,000 jobs. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT & 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I\u2019m supposed to be in New Hampshire. I\u2019m supposed to be in Georgia. I\u2019m supposed to be in North Carolina, South Carolina. I\u2019m supposed to be in other different places campaigning, but I\u2019ve been here all day on a trial that really is a very unfair trial. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL: President Biden and former President Trump on how his criminal trial is impacting his campaign. Let's bring in the powerhouse roundtable. We have former DNC chair Donna Brazile, former RNC chair and Trump White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, ABC News senior White House correspondent Selina Wang is back with us, and \u201cPolitico\u201d senior columnist, Jonathan Martin. J-Mart, let's start right with McCaul. This was a transformation -- JONATHAN MARTIN, SENIOR COLUMNIST, POLITICO: It sure was. KARL: -- that we saw it from the Speaker of the House Johnson. What do you think drove it? How did he suddenly become this force willing to lose his job for the sake of something he opposed just six months ago? MARTIN: I think it was a combination of intel briefings with folks who work for groups with acronyms that were on their organizations. KARL: CIA, DNI, whatever. MARTIN: Exactly, folks with four stars on their shoulders, foreign leaders. I think it was also frankly the call of history, him recognizing that he was in a providential moment. And lastly, politics. He was trying to save face, Jon. The fact is if he hadn't moved this bill the way he did, there was going to be an effort to bring it to the floor directly through a procedure that would have effectively brought the Senate bill up for a vote, gone around him, and so he wanted to save face. And he -- you know, cut the bill up like he did, and he added that TikTok ban which is, I think, more consequential than what would have happened if it was just the Senate bill. That's something else. KARL: Does he lose his job next? MARTIN: So, look, I think right now he obviously is going to face a challenge, but two things. I think the Democrats are going to rally to him because otherwise, they\u2019d look small, and they would not look like they were answering history's call. KARL: Yeah. MARTIN: But also, something else is important. I think Trump will stand with him at least for now not because Trump has this sort of great sense of altruism, but because of Trump's politics, Jon. He doesn't want the distraction and the mess. Trump does not want more drama. He has plenty on his own. KARL: All right. So, Donna, we heard Ro Khanna say he will vote to protect the Republican speaker of the House's job. Is that what we\u2019re going to see in the House? Are we going to see a lot of that? DONNA BRAZILE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it all depends. Look, I think the speaker will have to reach out to Hakeem Jeffries and others like he did over the last couple of days to be able to save -- save his job. But look, I have to say this. I\u2019m a Louisianan. I\u2019m always proud when Louisiana people come through, especially -- especially someone with LSU ties. But he's no -- he's no moderate. He's a MAGA Republican. We all know that. We know what he stands for. He resisted this. He said at first, we will not pass this foreign aid package until we get the appropriation bills through, until we get the FISA -- he kept putting conditions. At the end of the day, I agree with J-Mart, he decided to go with history and to be the soul who understood what's at stake and protecting Ukraine, serving -- protecting our allies in the Middle East, as well as in the Indo-Pacific region. So he did the right thing. KARL: So, Reince, let me ask you something -- about something that Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House from days long gone by, said about the mess unfolding. He said: The demons that Gaetz -- Matt Gaetz -- unleashed by going after Kevin McCarthy are still out there. You can't govern by shooting yourself in the head every day. MARTIN: Whoa. KARL: I think that's probably correct, but are Republicans going to be effectively shooting themselves in the head? REINCE PRIEBUS, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: No, I don't think so because obviously, I think Speaker Johnson and his leadership prevailed. And what he did was he also listened to his colleagues this week for hours. He allowed amendments on the floor, and I think he made it pretty clear as has been just said that, you know, it's one thing to govern through media clicks, small-dollar donations, podcasts, and getting famous as a representative. It's another thing when you sit down in intel hearings and discussions, and you really hear the truth and you listen to recordings, and you know what the truth is and you feel the weight of our country -- KARL: That Ukraine may fall if this doesn't pass. (CROSSTALK) PRIEBUS: And the uncertainty, and where we are going. The last thing though is Donald Trump also laid off. KARL: Yeah. PRIEBUS: Because he knows also the intelligence, number one. Number two, as was said, nobody in the Republican Party wants to look so stupid as to have yet another leadership fight with no pathway in sight. KARL: I got a fact check -- I've got to fact check you there because there are many Republicans who are already -- (CROSSTALK) PRIEBUS: It's OK if there's a few. There is a few, but -- KARL: But you are -- (CROSSTALK) PRIEBUS: there are always going to be a few that want -- that want to get this kind of attention, but Trump is doing very well. KARL: Yeah. Related Stories Mike Johnson gets bipartisan praise on Ukraine aid Apr 21, 12:21 PM Houses passes billions in foreign aid Apr 20, 4:30 PM Ukraine, Israel aid advances in rare House vote as Democrats help Republicans push it forward Apr 19, 10:28 AM PRIEBUS: And Trust in the Economy poll came out and he was plus 22 in Georgia, plus 12 in Michigan, and why would -- why would he or any Republican want to create this kind of mess? KARL: Selina, I saw you up there all week on the Hill running after those that were gunning for Johnson and also with Johnson himself. What is your sense? I mean, he sure seemed -- he seems confident that his job is not at risk. Is that a real confidence? SELINA WANG, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And every time he's asked about it, including when I did, he just laughs it off and says, I need to do my job. I can't be focused on this motion to vacate every day. But I think Reince makes a really good point which is when I was talking to a lot of these more moderate members of the Republican House, they said, look. I'm very angry at Johnson. I'm extremely disappointed in him, but it makes us, the Republican Party, look bad if we throw this House into chaos once again. So, they were saying they were not for what Marjorie Taylor Greene is doing, and so far let's be real. She's been all bark, no bite. We haven't seen any motion yet. So, so far Johnson has managed to use some Congressional jujitsu so get these bills across the finish line and so far he still kept his gavel. KARL: And the Democrats seemed serious about actually not allowing Marjorie Taylor Greene to do this. WANG: Yeah. I mean, I think that they understand that they want to get some stuff done and they're going to look like adults in the room if they end up -- if she ends up doing it, and they end up coming in to save him. So, there is really, even if there was a motion to vacate, it's not necessarily going to be successful. KARL: You know, Reince, your former colleague in the White House, Steve Bannon, told me this morning, Mike Johnson is going down. (LAUGH) PRIEBUS: Well -- MARTIN: When? What year? What year? (LAUGH) KARL: Yeah. MARTIN: We'll see. PRIEBUS: But I think -- I think as we're listening to this, the Democrats do need to be careful. I mean, they need to keep quiet as far as their willingness to jump up and down and save Speaker Johnson because the more Democrats come out and say, I'm going to protect Speaker Johnson, the more -- (CROSSTALK) KARL: (Inaudible) wait a second -- we can't have that. BRAZILE: Why would -- first of all, we're not going to be silenced because we're standing up for the American people. We want a budget that works for everybody. We want a country that functions. We want to, you know, we want to protect America's dignity in the world. PRIEBUS: By protecting Johnson, that's very good. (LAUGH) BRAZILE: Well, he's the Speaker of the House and while he is elected by the majority Republicans, he's a constitutional officer. So it's not about the individual, it's about the constitution and an officer of the nation. (CROSSTALK) PRIEBUS: (Inaudible). KARL: My question -- my question to Donna -- BRAZILE: He didn't come without some support. KARL: And to J. Mart though is, if Democrats continue -- if this effort goes forward and Johnson is there because there were Democrats that refused to go along with the effort to oust him, is there going to be a price that the Democrats -- now this is politics after all. Do Democrats want to get something in return for supporting Johnson? This is my question about a coalition government. BRAZILE: I mean, look. I'm not in Hakeem's office every day or anyone else in the House leadership, but as a former Hill staffer, I would hope that the Democrats would put the interest of the country -- this is a very -- as the president often said, it's an inflection point for the nation. So the Democrats must do what is in the best interest of the nation, and then figure out what's in the best interest of our chances 197 days from now. MARTIN: I think the agenda for the rest of this calendar year in the Congress is pretty darn thin. They're not bringing up the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, OK (ph)? (LAUGH) MARTIN: Talking about like re-authorizing, yes. KARL: The government's funding -- (CROSSTALK) MARTIN: We are authorizing the FAA, keeping the lights open in the government. Look, I think the only way the Democrats would change their mind and move on Johnson is, if Johnson was to move to impeach Biden, OK? KARL: Yeah. MARTIN: Because that I think would effectively break the tacit bargain. I don't see that happening. And if this is just sort of (ph) to keeping the government open until November, I think Johnson's job is safe because of those Democrats. KARL: All right. MARTIN: Now, next year, I think who knows? KARL: All right. I want to turn to the other big story this week, Trump in court, and I want to play a little something that he had to say outside of the courtroom this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: It's a shame. And I'm sitting here for days now, from morning till night, in that freezing room. Freezing. Everybody was freezing in there. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL: Everybody's freezing in there. I mean he's stuck in a room where he can't even control the thermostat. PRIEBUS: Fifty percent \u2013 KARL: You\u2019ve \u2013 you've seen that Donald Trump before. PRIEBUS: Well \u2013 KARL: That's an irritated Donald Trump. MARTIN: How cold is (INAUDIBLE)? PRIEBUS: Fifty percent of the American people think that this case is political. That's a big number. Donald Trump, of all people, is \u2013 he's turning himself into a victim. And that's an amazing thing. And \u2013 and he's doing it. And this is the perfect case to do it. And this is classic Donald Trump. And whether it be \u2013 not being able to go to Barron's high school graduation, whether it be not being able to go to the Supreme Court hearing this week, or whether it be freezing in the courtroom \u2013 KARL: He\u2019s been planning that graduation for years. Yes. PRIEBUS: Yes, but this is all part of the narrative. It's all part of the movie script moving forward. And \u2013 and he's playing it. BRAZILE: And that's why he's tried to delay this trial ten times, because it's meaningless. It doesn't matter. You know what matters? He is sitting in a courtroom every day while Joe Biden is going from your home state, to Pennsylvania, down to Florida this week, because the Biden campaign will take every opportunity to show that he was working for the American people. PRIEBUS: And \u2013 and it's not working. It's not working. He\u2019s still behind. He\u2019s still behind. WANG: But my \u2013 does \u2013 BRAZILE: Oh, man, you are reading the wrong polls. KARL: Selina. WANG: You know, I was going to say, but does his message from the courtroom, to make himself a victim, does that resonate with anyone outside of who already supports him? That\u2019s the question. PRIEBUS: I think it marginalizes with independents, whatever outcome happens in this case. In 2016 it was 24/7 lousy press, good press, every in between, Donald Trump. If you look at the press, 90 percent of it's about Trump. And he \u2013 he went through the last three weeks with five rallies a day and turned out one of the big upsets in modern history. When it's all about Trump, he's winning. MARTIN: Yes. No, I \u2013 so, I disagree with that. KARL: The FiveThirtyEight average has shown a bit of a (INAUDIBLE). MARTIN: I think the opposite is true. I think if the election was about Biden \u2013 KARL: A movement towards Biden. MARTIN: I think \u2013 if the election\u2019s about Biden, Trump\u2019s going to win. I think if the election\u2019s about Trump, Biden\u2019s got a lot better chance. KARL: Take \u2013 MARTIN: And right now Biden's problem is, this election\u2019s about Joe Biden. KARL: Yes. Yes, yes. I mean that \u2013 that \u2013 MARTIN: This is the challenge, right? KARL: That \u2013 those are the kind of numbers that make a Biden very nervous. MARTIN: And Michigan \u2013 KARL: So, Selina, how does the White House feel \u2013 MARTIN: Michigan\u2019s the most ominous number there. KARL: How does the White House deal with the fact that, you know, Trump is stuck, you know, he\u2019s got the world\u2019s attention, certainly. MARTIN: He\u2019s on trial and he\u2019s still winning. WANG: I think they're loving it actually because you haven't seen them directly tackle his legal issues head-on. You've seen veiled swipes from the president throughout this week. But for them, for the Biden campaign, they believe to have the former president, the GOP front-runner, sitting in court, defending himself against criminal charges for covering up this massive scandal, they think that speaks for himself. And you\u2019ve seen the president, he did some half a dozen campaign stops in Pennsylvania. He's going to be in Florida this week hammering home the issue of abortion, which is significant because as a Catholic he\u2019s been uncomfortable and then has let Harris deal with it. But they think that all these issues they\u2019re hitting on, on the economy, on abortion, that\u2019s going to be that strong split screen they want with Trump, meanwhile, in court. KARL: But, Donna, those numbers have to just terrify Democrats. BRAZILE: You know, Jonathan, last week I had numbers that looked better than that. Every week when we see one number this way and one number that way, they \u2013 they\u2019re going to seesaw. But here\u2019s \u2013 KARL: You know \u2013 BRAZILE: But here\u2019s \u2013 here\u2019s the best \u2013 here\u2019s the best part of this conversation. MARTIN: (INAUDIBLE). BRAZILE: No, it\u2019s not that far down because if you look that far \u2013 if you look that far down then you will not see the bottom. And I'm from the Mississippi River. I know \u2013 I know \u2013 MARTIN: He\u2019s scraping though. BRAZILE: No. It \u2013 you know, Joe Biden has to do a delicate dance in bringing back the Democratic family and the independents. MARTIN: Yes, tough. BRAZILE: Especially suburban women. MARTIN: Yes. BRAZILE: And he is showing every day that he's bringing them back home. And when he brings them home, they will turn out. KARL: All right. All right, time to go. MARTIN: The numbers aren't there yet though. KARL: Thank you all. We are \u2013 BRAZILE: That\u2019s what president \u2013 KARL: We've got to move on, because, up next, we have retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer joining me right here in our chambers in the studio. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.: I'm here today to express our nation's gratitude to Justice Stephen Breyer for his remarkable career in public service and his clear-eyed commitment to making our country's laws work for its people. STEPHEN BREYER, RETIRED ASSOCIATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: I can't take this around in my job. People have come to accept this Constitution, and they've come to accept the importance of a rule of law. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL: That was President Biden and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer speaking following Breyer's 2022 announcement that he was retiring. Justice Breyer is out with a new book titled \"Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism, Not Textualism.\" And Justice Breyer joins me now, right here in the studio. Thank you for joining us. BREYER: Well, thank you very much. KARL: So let me get right at the thesis of the book. You make the case, in this fascinating book, sweeping history of the Supreme Court, that justices should consider the practical consequences of a decision such as how those affected by the decision will react. How do you -- how does that work in practice? BREYER: In practice, you do your best to figure out what's going to happen. When it's most likely to play a major role is when you look at the words of the Constitution and they don't tell you the answer. Look at the words of a statute. They don't tell you the answer. And so people forever, since Chief Justice Marshall in eighteen-whatever-it-was, and Holmes and Brandeis, the others, they say, \"Look at -- somebody wrote those words. They had a reason. And you're -- you're interpreting them.\" KARL: Because, as you know, there's -- there's an argument that a justice has to stay within the -- the four corners of what's written on that page. BREYER: Yes. KARL: Let -- let's look at, for instance, in the Dobbs decision, what Justice Alito wrote, \"We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today's decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision.\" BREYER: Really? KARL: Why is he wrong? BREYER: Really? Because, well, let me give you a very simple case. You may know that if you have a person who has a child who's handicapped, the school board has to give that child a good education. And if the mother or father think not, they can bring a lawsuit. And if they win that lawsuit, the statute says they're entitled to their cost. Now, that was the case -- cost. Does cost include the cost of an educational expert, $29,000, or does it just mean legal cost? So I say, here. why don't you try this, Mr. Textualist? Say it loud. Cost! Now do you know the answer? Say it twice. Cost, cost -- three times, cost, cost, cost. It doesn't tell you. So the other things that judges have always looked to, too, who wrote those words and what did they have in mind? What was Congress trying to do? What are the consequences if you go one way rather than another way? How does it fit into a set of values that begins with the Constitution? Judges have always done that kind of thing, and it is part of the role of interpreting a statute, or the Constitution. KARL: So let me ask you, though, as a justice, when you're going through a high-profile controversial case,are you hearing the noise outside? I mean, I guess literally the protests outside the court, but more -- more broadly, do you -- are you gauging and thinking about how the world is going to react, how the country is going to react to your decision? BREYER: Yes. I would say that's in your mind. KARL: And how? How do you do that? Are you -- how? BREYER: And when you say, does that lead -- does that lead to your deciding X rather than not X? KARL: Yeah. BREYER: Well, I can never say never, but rarely. Paul Freund, Professor, right, Professor of Constitutional Law, said that the role of politics in the courts, any court, he says, no judge should or will be moved by the temperature of the day, but every judge will be aware of the climate of the season. KARL: So what about our time now? The political system seems hope hopelessly divided. The court seems to reflect that division. BREYER: Hard to say. It's a different -- it's a very complex institution, and where I think the politics that I've seen -- I've not seen politics in the court, and I have been a judge for 40 years. I have not seen -- KARL: You've not seen politics in the court? BREYER: Not politics in the sense in which I understood that word when I worked for Senator Kennedy, Ted Kennedy when I was a Senator. KARL: Yes. BREYER: And I worked there for a few years. Look, you get a phone call, Mayor of Wooster; same time -- KARL: Yeah. BREYER: Secretary of Defense, which call will Senator Kennedy take first? KARL: Mayor of Wooster. BREYER: Of course. It's politics. (LAUGH) BREYER: Of course. I mean, politics was how popular is this? How unpopular is that? KARL: Yeah. BREYER: How are we going to get the Republicans to go along possibly? Or some Democrats too? KARL: Yeah. BREYER: How do we get all the people to the Senate meetings? Where do you want to stand when you are running for election? And -- and, and, and -- no, that isn't there. That just isn't there. KARL: So, how important it was for the Supreme Court when they ruled on the Colorado case about whether or not Trump could be on the ballot that that was a unanimous decision? BREYER: How important was it? KARL: Yeah. BREYER: Well, don't talk about that case because you'll know more about it than me because that's after I left the court. But in general -- KARL: Yeah. BREYER: -- that is a very interesting question for me because it's very tempting once you've written a dissent, even from a denial -- refusal to hear a case. KARL: Yeah. BREYER: You've written the dissent. Your real audience is the other judges. But if you fail at that, now you've written it, why not let the country have the virtue of seeing your -- no, said Holmes. KARL: Yeah. BREYER: No, said Taft, and Taft said, it's just ego. So I always thought, well, it doesn't hurt to publish these things. It puts out another point of view. It shows people which they would believe anyway that not everybody's in agreement, but there's also something to be said to try to keep down the extent to which you publicly reveal the disagreement. KARL: Would the justices ever do the kind of horse trading we see in Congress? I mean, I don't mean to be crass about this -- BREYER: No. KARL: But you have two cases before the court that could determine the presidential election, decide one looks better for Donald Trump, the ballot access issue, one absolute immunity that doesn't serve his purposes, and they both come out, send the country a message? BREYER: I mean, I've been -- look, it may be that you could find a compromise in the conference or a way of approaching things in the conference that will, in fact, solve a number of problems, and that could be one of the problems. KARL: It would be a very powerful message to the country to see two 9-0 decisions that can't be broken down into straight political lines. BREYER: The second -- Sandra O'Connor used to say this. KARL: Yeah. BREYER: The first unwritten rule is nobody speaks twice until everyone speaks once. Second unwritten rule, tomorrow is another day. KARL: Yeah. BREYER: You and I were the greatest of allies on case one. Case two, we're absolutely at loggerheads. So -- KARL: but they are looking to how the country is going to receive these decisions? BREYER: Be careful in saying that. I want to say no. I want to say no, but I can't say no, never. I mean, you're up there in that. You're up there in that building which I can see a picture of. KARL: Yeah. BREYER: And in that building, you are making decisions that will affect people. Of course, knowing that a lot of people are going to read a case, leads me to write, if it's my opinion to write, use certain language that is easy to understand and spend a lot of time trying to explain why. KARL: And you don't want to contribute to the political divide in the country? BREYER: No. Of course, not. Of course, not, but you're looking for an easy answer. KARL: Yeah. BREYER: I'm not being coy and saying, no. There aren't easy answers. KARL: All right. Justice Stephen Breyer, thank you for being right here in the studio on \"This Week.\" It's an honor to have you here. Thank you. BREYER: Thank you. KARL: Coming up, MaryAlice Parks kicks off Earth Week with the ABC series, \"The Power of Us.\" We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KARL: As we mark Earth Day tomorrow, ABC News White House correspondent MaryAlice Parks travels to battleground Pennsylvania to report on the effort to turn out voters who care about climate change. It kicks off our network-wide series, \"The Power of Us\" covering emerging solutions for our changing world. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARYALICE PARKS, ABC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Emily Church is a biologist turned activist. EMILY CHURCH, BIOLOGIST AND CLIMATE ACTIVIST: I'm aiming for around 80 today. PARKS: Knocking on doors in Pittsburgh, she tells me she used to spend time pushing lawmakers on climate change, but lawmakers told her voters didn't care. CHURCH: The people who prioritize climate and the environment need to show up. If the voter comes to the door, basically just follow the script. PARKS: The Environmental Voter Project is targeting very specific voters, environmentally conscious citizens, often young people and people of color, who rarely head to the polls. Of all the ways to work on climate change, why this? JOANN KARSH, ENVIRONMENTAL VOTER PROJECT VOLUNTEER: Because people who vote or who politicians pay attention to, and so they make the decisions. NATHANIEL STINNETT, FOUNDER & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ENVIRONMENTAL VOTER PROJECT: And that's our biggest problem in the climate movement right now. We don't have enough voting power. PARKS: The group's founder, Nathaniel Stinnett, says they've had some success. STINNETT: We've sometimes increased turnout as much as 1.8 percentage points in general elections, 3.6 points in primaries and 5.7 points in local elections. PARKS: OK, if I'm being honest, that doesn't sound like a lot. STINNETT: Ask Donald Trump how big a deal 1.8 percent is in Pennsylvania, and he'll tell ya. PARKS: The group is nonpartisan though acknowledges it's almost exclusively Democrats right now working to address climate change. They hope they can push Republicans to come to the table, too. STINNETT: We want to scare the bejesus out of as many politicians as possible, no matter what side of the aisle they're on until they think, you know what, the only way I can win elections is if I start recognizing the biggest crisis that humanity faces. PARKS (voice-over): But that's no easy task. Across the board, this election registered voters list immigration, the economy, abortion, and democracy as their top issues, with climate change not even making the top ten. Partisan and generational divides at play. NATHANIEL RAKICH, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT SENIOR EDITOR & SENIOR ELECTIONS ANALYST: Basically the younger the voter, the more they're likely to prioritize climate change as a voting issue, and yeah, that is going to be a reality that Republicans are going to need to grapple with eventually. PARKS (voice-over): In November, the choice before voters is stark, but many Democrats worry young progressives might still stay home despite the Biden Administration investing billions to fight climate change. PARKS: What do you say to those young voters who argue, he hasn't done enough? LENA MOFFITT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. EVERGREEN ACTION: Well, the fact is President Biden has done more to address climate change than any president in U.S. history, and there's a lot more to be done. Scientists have said that we still can avoid the worst of the worst of the climate crisis, but what we do in these next few years is essential. PARKS (voice-over): Nathaniel says big policy matters and too often Americans have been too often told to focus on their own small habits. STINNETT: Hey, don't pay attention to that coal-fired power plant back there. Instead, it's all your fault for having a plastic water bottle in your hand and we bought it. When in truth, it is far more of a political and a systemic problem that needs political and systemic solutions. PARKS (voice-over): It's an uphill battle, but for Emily, finding and activating these new voters is worth the fight. CHURCH: The science is very clear. So, we know what we need to do. It's just a matter of getting it done. PARKS (voice-over): For \"This Week,\" MaryAlice Parks, ABC News, Pittsburgh.

            "content": "The House of Representatives on Saturday passed a series of foreign aid bills that allocate $60.8 billion for Ukraine, $26.4 billion for Israel and $8 billion for Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific allies. Another bill, passed by a vote of 360-58, would force the sale of TikTok and imposes strong sanctions on Iran, China and Russia. An amendment to that bill requires the Treasury Department to submit a report on Iranian assets and sanction exemptions. The four bills will now be sent to the Senate as a package. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Saturday that the Senate will take up the bills on Tuesday afternoon. The bill providing $8 billion in security aid for the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan, passed overwhelmingly in the House by a vote of 385-34-1. Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan was the only member who voted present. The House passed the Ukraine foreign aid bill by a vote of 311-112-1. The House passed the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act by a vote of 366-58. Democrats briefly waved Ukrainian flags during the vote, an action that prompted House Speaker Mike Johnson to remind them it was a violation for members to wave flags on the floor. Earlier, a GOP border security bill failed by a vote of 215-199. It was considered under suspension and did not reach a two-thirds majority. This bill was separate from the four foreign aid bills. After Democrats helped Johnson avoid defeat and advance the legislation on Friday, lawmakers considered amendments and held debate on Saturday before voting on final passage. President Joe Biden thanked House members for passing foreign aid package for Ukraine and Israel and said that the package comes at a \"critical inflection point\" for those nations. \"It comes at a moment of grave urgency, with Israel facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine under continued bombardment from Russia,\" Biden said in a statement Saturday. Biden also pointed to the \"desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, Sudan, Haiti\" included in the funding. Biden hailed the work of leaders in the House and the bipartisan group of lawmakers who he said \"voted to put our national security first,\" and called on the Senate to get the package to his desk. \"I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs,\" Biden added. MORE: A TikTok ban is wrapped in Speaker Johnson's foreign aid package: What happens next? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy applauded the passing of the bill with bipartisan support in a statement on X, formerly Twitter. \"I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track. Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it,\" Zelenskyy said in a statement. He added, \"The vital U.S. aid bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger. We hope that bills will be supported in the Senate and sent to President Biden's desk. Thank you, America!\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also thanked the House for approving aid.

Thank you friends, thank you America!\" Netanyahu said in a Tweet on X. Could the Speaker get ousted? Johnson's push to get the aid across the finish line has angered some of his conference's far-right members, causing a growing threat to his speakership. A third Republican, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, announced Friday he was joining a looming motion to oust Johnson just after the aid bills advanced. Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced the motion last month, accusing Johnson of \"standing with the Democrats\" after he worked across the aisle to avoid a government shutdown. After Johnson unveiled his plan to forge ahead on foreign aid, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky became the second hard-liner to back Greene's cause. Massie called on Johnson to resign, a suggestion Johnson flatly rejected . Speaker of the House Mike Johnson talks to reporters just after lawmakers pushed a $95 billion national security aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies closer to passage, at the Capitol, April 19, 2024. J. Scott Applewhite/AP All three lawmakers have expressed frustration on Johnson moving ahead with foreign aid without addressing immigration. Though earlier this year, a bipartisan border deal was produced by a group of senators but was quickly deemed dead on arrival by former President Donald Trump and Johnson. \"Our border cannot be an afterthought,\" Gosar said in a statement. \"We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away.\" MORE: Johnson says he won't change rules for ousting speakers after warnings from GOP hard-liners Green did not move to oust the Speaker on Saturday before the House adjourned until April 29, although she claimed her coalition against Johnson is growing. \"I'm actually going to let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents, because I think people have been too obsessed, with voting for foreign wars and the murder industry, here in America that actually understand how angry Americans are,\" Greene said Saturday. Johnson said Friday that the bills are \"not the perfect legislation\" but are \"the best possible product\" under the circumstances. It remains to be seen when, or if, the hard-liners force a vote on the motion to vacate the speaker's chair. If they do, Democrats would potentially need to step in to save Johnson's job. Several Democrats told ABC News Saturday that they're open to saving Speaker Johnson -- if Greene makes good on her threat to call for a vote to oust him -- if Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries gave them the okay, or at minimum didn't oppose the move. ABC News White House correspondent MaryAlice Parks asked the administration if President Joe Biden discussed that possibility with Speaker Johnson in their phone call earlier this week. \"We do not get involved when it comes to leadership in, whether it's the Senate or in the House,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded. \"We're very mindful. That is something that the members, in this case the members in Congress, have to decide on.\" ABC News' Jay O'Brien contributed to this report.",
